Neil Williams - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Matt Rhodes - Director of Investor Relations Analysts : Gil Luria - Wedbush Securities Greg Dunham - Goldman Sachs Peter Goldmacher - Cowen and Company Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research John Byun - UBS Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital Brad Zelnick - Macquarie Ross MacMillan - Jeffries & Company Ken Wong - Citigroup Wayne Johnson - Raymond James Jim Macdonald - First Analysis David Togut - Evercore Partners Yum Kim - Janney Capital Michael Millman - Millman Research Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Saeed and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt Rhodes, Intuit's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rhodes, you may begin. Matt Rhodes : Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2014 conference call. I\u2019m here with Brad Smith, our President and CEO, and Neil Williams, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2013 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. As a reminder, all reported results exclude Intuit Financial Services and Intuit Health, which have been sold and reclassified to discontinued operations. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brad Smith. Brad Smith : Alright, thanks Matt, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. We\u2019re out of the gate strong in fiscal 2014. We grew revenue 11% in the first quarter and we\u2019re reiterating our guidance for the fiscal year. You\u2019ll hear more on that from Neil in a minute. As you know, we realigned the organization on August 1, focusing the Company on two strategic outcomes, to be the operating system behind small business success, and to do the nations\u2019 taxes in the U.S. and Canada. Over the past several years, Intuit has successfully transitioned to become a leader in cloud solutions for small businesses and consumers. Two-thirds of our 45 million customers use cloud solutions, and nearly two-thirds of our revenue comes from higher-value cloud and connected services with predictable, recurring revenue streams. In our tax businesses, 75% of our Consumer Tax customers use TurboTax Online, and we have a first-mover advantage with our cloud-based professional tax offerings. An aggressive shift to the cloud is building momentum in our small business segment as well. More than 1 million QuickBooks customers are now in the cloud. QuickBooks Online crossed the milestone of 500,000 subscribers, up 29% and accelerating from the fourth quarter. Global distribution is helping to drive this growth, with QuickBooks Online subscribers up more than 80% to over 37,000 paying customers outside the United States. In fact, on average, a new QuickBooks Online subscriber is signing up every minute around the globe. We also have an additional 500,000 QuickBooks desktop customers who have moved their data to the cloud, and when you include QuickBooks Enterprise, our total QuickBooks subscriber base is up 25% year-over-year. This growth is no coincidence. Cloud-based offerings provide superior benefits for small businesses and we want all of our small business customers to adopt cloud solutions. In support of this goal, we\u2019ve been aggressively reducing friction across the ecosystem to make it easy for QuickBooks customers, accountants and developers to embrace the next chapter. The new QuickBooks Online that we unveiled on Investor Day in September is now available to all new customers, and we\u2019re rolling it out to existing QuickBooks Online and desktop customers over the next several months. Just a few ways that we\u2019re driving adoption include a new three-step, three-minute conversion process for the QuickBooks desktop customers to transfer their data to QuickBooks Online. We\u2019re marketing this capability more aggressively to our desktop base as the new QuickBooks Online rolls out more broadly. For new customers, we\u2019re using the power of big data to customize their QuickBooks Online experience based upon other small businesses that look like them, completing their setup process in a matter of seconds. We\u2019re complementing these efforts with strong promotional incentives for accountants and small businesses to drive adoption of QuickBooks Online, and will continue to target and test promotions in different markets around the globe. To accelerate the global adoption, we\u2019ve strengthened our Intuit Partner Platform for third-party developers in the U.S., in Canada, in the U.K., Australia and India, the five priority countries where we\u2019re currently focused. We strengthened our APIs, making it easier for developers to build solutions that seamlessly integrate with QuickBooks Online, and we\u2019ve upgraded our apps.com distribution that showcases our developer partners, now making their apps easily discoverable from within the product at the moment of need. And finally, we\u2019ve modified our pricing to attract the best developers, and we are proud to announce the addition of American Express, who has built a new app called ReceiptMatch for QuickBooks. The app allows small businesses to take pictures of their receipts and match them with their QuickBooks chart of accounts in a matter of seconds. The app is going to be available in early 2014. And while we have encouraging momentum in small business, we are looking forward to the upcoming tax season as well. Fiscal 2014 is a pivot year for Consumer Tax. I like the changes the team is driving, and I believe this year will represent a strong initial step towards the multi-year journey to achieve our vision of 'taxes are done'. In the upcoming season, we are laser-focused on driving improvement in three critical areas. First, we intend to improve the conversion of new users with a simpler experience to help customers through their tax return with increased speed, ease and confidence. Second, we\u2019re streamlining the returning user experience, unleashing the power of customer data to simplify the tax prep process and help them easily understand year-over-year changes in their tax return. And third, we\u2019re creating a unified help and answer experience, driving TurboTax customers to clear explanations on everything that is tax related, including the Affordable Care Act. In the Professional Tax business, we\u2019re off to a strong start early in the season, and our shift to the cloud is picking up steam. We intend to build on our lead and capitalize on this once-in-a-generation shift to the cloud for the accountants as well. Now as you\u2019ve likely heard, the IRS anticipates some delays to the start of the tax season again this year. It\u2019s too early to know the exact impact on our business, but we will keep you posted as we learn more. And so with that context, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details and our guidance. R. Neil Williams : Thanks Brad. Let\u2019s start with overall Company results. For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we delivered revenue of $622 million, up 11%, non-GAAP operating loss of $20 million, GAAP operating loss of $77 million, non-GAAP loss per share of $0.06, and a GAAP loss per share of $0.04. In the first quarter, we accelerated some investments in data and small business marketing to drive growth throughout fiscal 2014 and beyond. As a result, expenses grew slightly faster than revenue, consistent with our plans for the quarter. Turning to the business segments, total Small Business revenue grew 11% in the first quarter. Within Small Business, Small Business Financial Solutions or SBFS revenue grew 9%. Within SBFS, QuickBooks revenue also grew 9%, driven by increased adoption of our cloud solutions; QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 29%, with modest benefit from the new QuickBooks Online which became available to all customers late in the first quarter. QuickBooks Desktop subscribers grew 17%, QuickBooks Enterprise subscribers grew 21%, and our Small Business deferred revenue grew 13%, driven in part by the subscriber growth I just mentioned. Payments revenue grew 8% in the first quarter. As a reminder, we had two months of benefit from the Durbin amendment in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, creating a tough comparison. Merchants grew 10% and card transaction volume grew 6%. As Brad mentioned, we also recently announced partnerships with Square and American Express, which will provide easy integration with QuickBooks Online. Now let\u2019s move to Small Business Management Solutions, or SBMS, where overall revenue grew 15%. Within SBMS, Employee Management Solutions revenue grew 12%, driven by strong growth in online customers. Online Payroll customers grew 18%, and within Online Payroll, full-service payroll customers grew 85% to over 13,000. In addition, Demandforce subscribers grew 36%. We recently acquired Full Slate, a leader in online scheduling capabilities for small businesses which will join the Demandforce team. Within the Consumer segment, Consumer Tax revenue was up 11% versus the first quarter last year, driven by late-season filers and additional attached services. As you know, our Consumer Tax business is highly seasonal and our first quarter is a light one. The first quarter is also relatively small for our Professional Tax segment, where revenue grew 16 %. It\u2019s early in the year, but we\u2019ve seen strong customer acquisition and renewals for the upcoming tax season. As we told you in September, we made some product changes in this segment. The second-quarter guidance that we reiterated today includes a shift of approximately $70 million in ProTax revenue from the second quarter to the third quarter as compared to fiscal 2013. Turning to the balance sheet, we continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield 15%-plus ROI. So far this fiscal year, we\u2019ve made four small acquisitions with a total investment of around $90 million. These were talent acquisitions that provide Intuit with innovative teams of highly skilled data scientists, engineers and designers who will add great value across our businesses. In acquiring these companies, we used a mix of cash and equity in order to align the sellers\u2019 success with Intuit\u2019s over the long term, and as a way to retain top talent. We also returned cash to shareholders via share repurchases. In the first quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy back $1.4 billion worth of shares and about $2 billion remains on our authorization. We expect to reduce our share count 4% to 6%, net in fiscal 2014. Our Board also approved a $0.19 dividend for the second quarter of fiscal 2014, payable on January 21. Moving to guidance, we reiterated our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2014. You can find the details in our press release. As Brad mentioned, we expect a late start to this tax season. That could impact form availability and push Consumer Tax and ProTax revenue from our second fiscal quarter to our third fiscal quarter. We\u2019ll update you as the season approaches if our expectation for the timing of revenue has a material impact on our guidance for Q2. And one housekeeping item. As a reminder, we'll provide tax unit updates in February in conjunction with our second-quarter earnings release and in late April after the tax season is over. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith : Okay, thank you, Neil. It\u2019s obviously early in the fiscal year, but we\u2019re off to a great start. As you can probably sense, we\u2019re excited about the new QuickBooks Online, which is accelerating our transition to the cloud, creating value for Intuit and for our shareholders. We\u2019re also gearing up for tax season and looking forward to getting our new offerings out into the market in the next couple of weeks. As always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and their ongoing focus, and with that, let me turn it over to you to hear what\u2019s on your mind. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities. Gil Luria - Wedbush Securities : The success of QuickBooks Online internationally, it started even before you put a lot of emphasis on it, but can you help us a little bit in terms of what your approach is for helping that go to the next level? You are working with accounts internationally in a different way than you have before. Is that any different than the way you work with accounts in the U.S.? Brad Smith : First of all, yes, there are things that are different. First of all, the new version of QuickBooks Online which we referred to at Investor Day is Harmony, is now available across the globe and with our new changes to the Intuit Partner Platform, we have the ability for third-party developers around the globe to build on the QuickBooks Online platform. But then what we did differently this year is we focused in on the four priority countries in addition to the United States, so Canada, the U.K., Australia, and India. And in doing that, we prioritized what was the best go-to-market plan for each of those four countries. The emphasis is clearly on online and web side and it's also the accountant channel, and in each of those four countries, we think getting underneath the hood \u2013 in fact I was just out in each of those countries in the last two weeks, sitting with accountants understanding what was it they were looking for from the product, what was it they were looking for from a services and program perspective, and what can we do more of to help them be successful, and in each of those four countries, our teams are tailoring the go-to-market offering. Sometimes it is about offering them incentives to sell, sometimes it is about offering them the ability to be found by small businesses [inaudible] product, find a ProAdvisor, but in each country it's slightly nuanced and we have a 'right for me' approach for each of the four markets and that's what's helping us getting accelerated traction in the market. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Dunham from Goldman Sachs. Greg Dunham - Goldman Sachs : Also following up on QuickBooks Online, and asking in a different way more on the U.S. performance, if you look at the growth in subscribers in the U.S., it looks like it's in the high teens, it's 17%, but obviously you released it with only a month left in the quarter, so the question is, how much lift did you get in October from the release and what kind of growth rates of QuickBooks Online subscribers are you seeing post the release? Brad Smith : Greg, first of all, in the United States, QuickBooks Online in the quarter was up 26%. So if you exclude the global number, it was actually up 26%. And the second part of the answer is exactly what you hypothesized, that we got very minimal lift from the new QuickBooks Online in the first quarter because we were just rolling it out in a phased approach to new customers. So we expect to see the incremental impact of this new version of QuickBooks Online as we head into Q2 and then into Q3. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Goldmacher from Cowen. Peter Goldmacher - Cowen and Company : I wanted to ask you a quick question. Usability obviously is a core focus for you guys and obviously an important one, and the examples you gave were good examples of how to help make conversion easier, but QuickBooks has pretty high churn. Can you talk a little bit about usability in the product that is being aimed at reducing that attrition? Brad Smith : Yes, sure I can, Peter. In fact with QuickBooks Online, the challenge we had was getting people into the actual product and having them being productive as quickly as possible. It used to take as much as 40 minutes in the old QuickBooks Online Classic to get your product set up for you and to be able to customize what tabs you would need if you had inventory or if you were more of a services-based business. Now by using the data in the cloud and finding customers who look like you out of the 500,000 other subscribers, we can get you set up in seconds. The other thing we've done is we've erased the organizational things between payroll and payment. So you get inside the QuickBooks, you add an employee and in a three-step process you are literally paying your employee with payroll. So we are seeing a much stronger uptick in the early indicators for attach, which we think will hold promise as we go further into the rollout. The one thing you'll see it's doing in the next four to six weeks is run a six-week release cycle and we're addressing other areas in the product that we now have the opportunity to continue to be further enhanced, things like banking fees and bank reconciliation as well as other areas that will continue to help the customers move to the product in a \u2013 and as you said, a cleaner usability experience. But net-net, what we are seeing right now is we've smoothed out the navigation, we've sped up the actual setup process, we made it easier to cross-sell and buy products, we made it easier for third-party applications to be found inside the product, and in the areas where we aren't all the way to [inaudible], we are on six-week cycles to knock those down as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : In your prepared remarks, you used the word 'pivotal' for the tax season and I'm wondering did you mean pivotal as in it is a pivotal time for Intuit or are you expecting some change in the industry and that's why the season becomes pivotal and very important? Brad Smith : Actually the word I meant to articulate was pivot and the pivot is away from relying heavily over the last several years on advertising. So a very significant shift towards the new product vision which we describe as, 'taxes are done'. And that's going to be a multi-year journey that we talked a little bit about at Investor Day but this is going to be that first initial foray into making this product frictionless. In fact the team aspires to basically have a product that is no effort, no risk, no doubt. And so we are focusing on simple filer this year for the first time filer, we are focusing on saving more of those 5 million customers that are returning users and may end up not coming back the second year, and we are focusing on simplifying the user experience to get answers to questions. And so, it's basically what we're calling a pivot year which is internally we've really geared up our engineering efforts, our product efforts and we're basically looking to lean more into having a great product experience that leads the way in the market. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And just a last question, Brad, on QuickBooks Online, as you move to the cloud, there seems to be a greater number of competitors in the market. Is that changed anyway how you have to market the product, does that change maybe your emphasis on consumer versus accountant, or anything else you'll do to make sure that the product gets proper recognition? Brad Smith : Actually when new competition comes in and especially if they generate press, it truly creates an opportunity for us to accelerate the category growth to get people out of spreadsheets and shoeboxes, which is where 42% of small businesses still do their accounting, and gets them to consider a solution. What we've been able to do is we've been able to capitalize on that. We have been at all the major accounting shows, we've been at all the major trade shows, we're out there on the web, we obviously have an exciting program of Small Business Big Game where we had this six-month social campaign and there was going to be a winner who's going to get a 30 second TV ad, and the third quarter the biggest game of the year. And so all of that actually is good news for us in terms of getting people to raise their head and say, hey, it sounds like there is something in the market that's maybe different, and as long as our product is superior to every other solution in the market, then we think this is nothing but good news for us. So there isn't anything we've had to do differently other than make sure people know that we have a leading cloud solution that has been completely re-imagined and if you give it a test drive, even if you tried it a couple of years ago, you're going to find a completely different experience. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. John Byun - UBS: This is John Byun for Brent Thill. Just had two questions. One, you mentioned Full Service Payroll was up more than 80%, realizing it's such a small base but why the strength there? And then the second question is just a quick one on, there were some questions in the past about filing of tax extensions. I'm wondering whether you had seen an impact from that in the October quarter. Brad Smith : So let me start with the first one. As you may recall, we looked at extending our payroll offering on the high end to include something called Full Service Payroll which not only enables you to input your hours and basically your wage rate but also will handle the filing for you and will handle any inquiries that may come from the IRS if you have any sort of an audit or a potential penalty. And so that's pretty much a direct competitive alternative to some of the outsourced solutions in the market. The difference is, ours is driven from algorithms. We're able to look at big data and able to look at prior user behavior to see where there may be a potential input error and we could tell you that you mean to type 400 hours or did you mean to type 40 hours, and by correcting it at the point of input, we reduce the potential errors down the road which lead to penalties and interests, and about 40% of small businesses by the way make a mistake every year on payroll. And so by doing this, we are able to basically eliminate that risk of mistake. The product is so simple to use, it's online and it is really accelerating in terms of its traction in the market. And so that's what's driving the 85% growth rate. And you're right, it's also the small base of about 13,000 customers but that continues to accelerate and we're excited about its future potential. The second is the filing of returns and tax. Yet we did see the continuation of people filing extensions up through October 15. That's what drove some of our tax numbers that you heard Neil talk about earlier, [indiscernible] ProTax as well as some Consumer Tax. At the same time though, it wasn't enough to offset what everyone had anticipated what have happened this past tax season in terms of the total returns being filed. So while it certainly was more than we had forecasted, it still didn't make up the delta of what we had fully expected for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Following up on the Consumer Tax question that you're coming up, I just wanted to clarify, it sounds like you're going to do much more of a [deti] (ph) on the product itself and you alluded to a shift away from advertising, I just wanted to \u2013 could you specify that a little bit more, is that a spend thing, is that a type of customer that you're going after, just some kind of elaboration there? Brad Smith : We used the word at Investor Day too, so I don't want to lead anyone down a false sense there is something fundamentally different than what we talked about in September. So if I can take the word 'pivot' and pull it out of the vocabulary and talk about what exactly we are doing differently this year, we mentioned that over the last couple of years, we hadn't made the advances in the product that we feel we needed to make, and as we looked ahead, we thought there is a real opportunity now that we have the power of data, we have an ecosystem of offerings like W-2 that we pay with employee payroll in small business, bank fees and a lot of other information that we can basically help you get your tax return done in a much shorter period of time if we take the burden on of getting all the data input for you. And so that's what we call, 'taxes are done'. It's going to be a multi-year effort to get to our nirvana. Our nirvana is to eliminate basically 7 billion hours of tax preparation for consumers and to reduce the tax prep drudgery for the professional to actually do tax preps, so make it easier for the accountants and the TPAs as well. And so what you see shifting this year is much more of an emphasis on the product innovation. In terms of advertising and marketing, the last few years we have engaged an increased spending of marketing and advertising. What you will see differently this year is we're going to be much more targeted and much more specific about how we look for effectiveness in that advertising. As opposed to a continuation of increased investment, we're going to look for how we get more bang for our buck out of our marketing. So those are really the concepts that we are talking about when we talk about a pivot year, as leaning more into product innovation and then allowing the advertising to basically showcase the product. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Thanks for that clarification. On the tax season, could you speak, when you answered the question about extension, could you speak to what it looks like it's trending for returns at IRS this year and again repeat it doesn't look like possible delay this year yet affect your thinking on the upcoming year, what's your anticipation for returns with IRS in the 2014 season maybe? Brad Smith : I wish on this first one I had an answer for you. We haven't gotten any update from the IRS as a result of everyone has filed October 15 to know what the year is looking like. Our data suggested it was still going to be shy of flat to prior year but we will have to see what the rest of the industry shows up doing. In terms of this coming year and what the delays are, we really don't have enough information to know what the implications would be. Our expectations for return growth though is we are in that 0% to 1% range and we are kind of targeting in that sort of zip code for year-over-year return growth, but that will be more informed once we get a deeper analysis from the IRS and how the full year played out this year. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Thanks and then just one more and just to get Neil involved, is the accelerated share repurchase complete yet, will we know when it is complete, will there be some type of announcement, and while it's ongoing, are you able to repurchase shares in the open market [indiscernible]? R. Neil Williams : We are about 70% done, 70% to 75% done through the end of the first quarter. We anticipate it will be completed in December. We are not anticipating doing any type of release or announcement when it is finished but those are the timings that we are looking for at this point. And we are not precluded from acquiring additional shares while the ASR is in effect. So yes, we are free to do that if we choose. Operator : Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe from Morgan Stanley. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley : I had two questions but they are related, so I'll come together. First I wanted to ask about the Affordable Care Act and certainly the launch hasn't been as smooth there as the government would have hoped, but you won given kind of the disruption there in the initial side. Has that changed your thinking at all about the Affordable Care Act opportunity for Intuit either positively or negatively? And then related to that, I think the consumer opportunity with eHealth got some discussion at Analyst Day but some of the demos I've seen at the gallery also suggest that there's a small business opportunity for Intuit with the Affordable Care Act as well as the material solutions. So can you talk a little bit about where you might be able to capture some opportunity as the Affordable Care Act goes into effect? Brad Smith : Sure, Jennifer, happy to do that. First of all, we weren't really banking on much impact in this coming year from the Affordable Care Act. We know that there is a lot of learning going on right now. Obviously there are a lot of issues being worked through at the government level. However we do have a solution out there. We have the AnswerXchange, so if you have any question regarding the Affordable Care Act or any applications for your taxes, that's up and available today, and our partnership with eHealth is out there as well but if you want to go out and shop in an exchange for the best potential health plan to meet your needs, you have that ability to do it as well. Which takes me to the second part of your question, our partnership with eHealth we are excited about and we continue to work closely with them to make sure that that process is seamless from getting a question-and-answer to being able to shop for health plan and to have that data flow into TurboTax, but as you suggested, small businesses are also happy and content with answering questions from their employees on 'what does it mean to me', and if they don't offer health plans, it gives them the ability to actually point their employees to an exchange. So we have an Intuit Small Business Health Exchange that we basically are working with. It's currently in pilot in California. The implications for small businesses are not as pressing as they are for consumers right now, and so what we are doing is we're piloting the experience in California and as we learn more, we may scale that out across the country as well. And imagine that being the same thing as it is for TurboTax. You can go in and get questions answered, and then if you want to shop for a health plan, you can go out on an exchange and you can actually make a purchase as an employee. That's complemented with the products we have in payroll right now which is basically a prepaid card or a pre-tax card that a small business can make a contribution to an employee in pre-tax dollars that they can then use to make a purchase of a health plan. And so we are putting together a nice pool of value proposition for small businesses and their employees as well. So we don't expect a lot this year for all the reasons you just cited but we do think this is a real opportunity for us to get our learning in place and to make sure we do have the offerings in the market so when consumers and small businesses are ready, that we have the absolute best set of solutions for them. Operator : Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital : Can I just go back to the new QuickBooks Online product please. Can you just walk me through, how does it work for the 500,000 QuickBooks Online users that you have at the moment, are you just converting them over and once you have converted them over, can you talk a little bit about the up-sell of opportunities, so is QuickBooks Online, the new Harmony version a new tool to get more customers or do [indiscernible] total base out as well? Brad Smith : I'm going to ask you to help me with the second part of your question but let me answer the first part. So today what we have done, we have focused on new users who have never used QuickBooks Online because there is no relearning of navigation. At the same time, we've been testing with small streams of existing customers, how much of a learning curve is there to move from the QuickBooks Online Classic to the new QuickBooks Online, and we have been pleasantly surprised that there is little to no transition time. It is very intuitive and they are able to get up and running very quickly. And in fact we've had our power users, the accountants, basically make sure they pressure test that concept. So now what we are doing is we are starting to open it up to existing QuickBooks Online customers as well as helping QuickBooks Desktop customers with a three-step three-minute conversion that will pull their data out of the desktop and put it into the new QuickBooks Online, and that's going to be happening over the next several months. So we started with new users first, we tested with existing to make sure we understood the learning curve transitioning, and now we are opening up the floodgates for them to be able to move over as well. The second part of your question around the up-sell, I'm just going to ask you to articulate what specifically you were looking for there and then we'll try to answer that. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital : Remember like you have to make a service to go with it, do you think Harmony makes it easier to sell the connected services or is it going to be the same but you have a nicer looking solution that kind of makes it easier? Brad Smith : Yes, it does make it easier. We are looking at leading indicators in the product right now but the number of people who click through to payment, the number of people who actually fulfil a payment application, the number of people who send a first invoice, and all of those indicators are up quite measurably for all the attached products, and so we think that is a good precursor for what we think the attached rates will ultimately end up being for the new QuickBooks Online. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Macquarie. Brad Zelnick - Macquarie: Brad, I know it's only been a couple of months since Investor Day but is there anything incremental this year about your efforts to further leverage the base of accounting professionals to drive QuickBooks sales and serve the channel to better compete with tax stores? Brad Smith : It's a continuing confirmation of what we talked about at Investor Day, a couple of concepts. First of all, what has surprised us more than we had anticipated is the readiness and willingness of the accountants to adopt cloud solutions. So in our ProTax business, the shift to the ProTax cloud product, we call it Intuit Tax Online, it's built on the Lacerte engine. Even though it is early season, the early sales on that are ahead of our forecast. When you look at the QuickBooks Online for Accountant, so the accountant version of QuickBooks Online, we're seeing a very good adoption rate on that product not only in the U.S. but outside the globe. And while it's early yet, we're getting very strong signals that Books to Tax, which is the ability to actually press a button in QuickBooks Online for Accountant and have that go into the new cloud version of the tax system and basically do the tax for the small business, is going to be an asset that's very important to accountants as well. That's why we're describing this for the accounting base as what we think as a once-in-a-generation shift and we have a good first mover advantage and not only just in a ProTax product but also with QuickBooks Online and the ability to have both sides of that equation. So, so far there isn't anything that is new that we didn't talk about at Investor Day, other than the early indications from the sales pipeline and the feedback from accountants that it's very positive. Brad Zelnick - Macquarie: I appreciate that, Brad. If I could sneak in just one more, looking to consumer ecosystem, slightly better than flat, again we spoke about this a bit at investor Day as well, but can you just paint for us, if we decompose that number, what's going on between Quicken and Mint and as we look forward, what's your expectation, what does it really take to get this business growing into its potential? Brad Smith : Sure. First of all, Quicken 2014, we just released it a few weeks ago. We have some good news there with the new application having the ability to take a picture of your receipt and embed it in. So we are getting some good early reviews. We just released Mint in iOS 7 and it has got the new very important feature that we always had on the web but we never had on the phone, called Mint Trends, and that's really causing some very good positive buzz and very high user ratings on the app stores. So right now overall, it's really there's been goodness in Quicken because that's the bulk of the revenue in that consumer ecosystem, and at the same time we're seeing some good early indicators in Mint. In terms of what it's going to take for it to be meaningful, a couple of pieces here. First of all, in the tax business, this is Consumer Tax and ProTax, the strategy 'our taxes are done', and then after that we are looking for ways to help families do more with their money. And so a lot of what we're doing right now out in the consumer ecosystem work with the tax team to say, okay, how do we take that 50% of families that didn't even expect to get a refund, now they have this found money, how do we help them do smarter things with that, either fund better deals, or invest it in 401(k) plans, and so our consumer ecosystem is working with them. The other thing the consumer ecosystem is doing is they have taken the Mint platform and they have given it to the Small Business team to go after these customers that aren't big enough for QuickBooks yet. And you'll see Mint MyBusiness coming out soon, it's in beta now, that will basically help those businesses that operate as a single entrepreneur out of their bedroom and help them separate their personal from their business expense, and then what ultimately happens is once they do that, they can literally press a button and it goes into TurboTax and does their tax return. So basically the consumer ecosystem is going to become the glue that helps you do more with the refunds you get from your taxes and also helps to be the platform in the low end of QuickBooks and basically pulls the entire company's ecosystem together. It's early days but we really like the progress happening across all those fronts. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan from Jeffries. Ross MacMillan - Jeffries & Company: Brad, when I look at your subscription adds, the net subscription adds in the quarter, QuickBooks Online was really strong but Enterprise and QuickBooks Desktop in terms of the net new adds look less strong. I was just curious as to whether you're seeing any shift maybe with the advent of the Harmony release from traditional QuickBooks Desktop users that had been on subscription towards the online product or indeed if that's happening on the Enterprise side as well, I'm just curious as to any dynamics in there that might add some color around that. Brad Smith : Right now it's still too early to say that it's going all to the new QuickBooks Online. What we do know and what we actually hope for is that we'll get the customers to move to QuickBooks Online. We think it's just an elegant solution and it is going to have a robust set of third-party developers out there and we think that is clearly the chapter for small businesses that we need to be moving to. The Desktop customers that want to upload their data in the cloud continue to grow strong for us but we are trying aggressively to get them to convert over to QuickBooks Online instead of simply uploading their data into the cloud. And so while I can't tell you that that is fully attributable to the first quarter results, I can tell you from an emphasis perspective that's why we have put together a three-step three-minute conversion process to get them up into QuickBooks Online. Enterprise continues to be strong. I would tell you that where we are right now is we have learned from certain promotions that we had used extensively last year starting to get a little stale in the fourth quarter. These are primarily promotions through our own base to get them to move up to QuickBooks Enterprise, and the team has been doing some pretty interesting innovation around different marketing messages to basically get them to move into the new Enterprise product and we think that that product will continue to grow. And that 21% is a good healthy growth, it's up to 91,000 users now, I don't think that is attributable to QuickBooks Online. That's a more full-featured product with deep inventory, but what we are doing is we are starting to get new promotional offers that we are testing that we think will incentivize people to move up. So, net-net, it is our focus to get Desktop to Online. I can't say that in the first quarter the fact that Desktop subscribers were up 17% was directly attributable to the new online version but it will be our focus going forward. Ross MacMillan - Jeffries & Company: That's helpful, thanks. And then maybe a follow-up for Neil, two questions if I could. Your gross margin progression in the mobile has been very impressive and you continue to show year-on-year expansion in gross margin. I'm just curious if you could just talk to some of the drivers and also your expectations around how that will progress this year. And then one other quick follow up on tax. Just so I understand, given that you had guided the year before the IRS made this statement around the potential delay in the tax season, today you haven't made any changes to the seasonality since your initial guide, does that mean that you've already factored some of that in or are you just sort of saying, let's see how things progress? R. Neil Williams : First of all, in the gross margin category, we are delighted with the impact that the shift to SaaS product has on our gross margins, and a lot of it has to do with the engagement of the customers and how they attach with their products and services and things like that. As Brad mentioned earlier, we are being very thoughtful about how we allocate our resources among care, among marketing and among engineering in product development, and we are trying to test all those components and make sure that we have really good indicators of value from customers and that's really helpful in attracting new customers and improving conversion before they make long term commit to those. So I think some of the improvement you're seeing is a reflection of us getting a little better in terms of our allocation of how we spend and invest to build the products and deliver them in the market, and we still think there is opportunity to improve there. Again as Brad mentioned, we are making a lot of investments particularly in tax this year on the product side that maybe have been basically pent-up demand there to get the product where it needs to be. So that's where the improvement is coming from really. I think there's better resource allocation against the returns delivering and I think there is continued improvement there as we go forward. On the tax side, what we are trying to say there is that we don't think this shift or whenever the IRS starts accepting returns that any impact on our tax guidance for the full year is very likely to be an impact on the shift from the second quarter to the third quarter. Each year when we give our quarterly guidance, we make some assumptions around when the IRS will open and when they will begin accepting returns because as you know that's a critical factor for us in when we can recognize the revenue. We're going to wait and see when the IRS actually begins to open and start accepting returns and then we will make a determination as to whether or not our guidance needs to shift between the second and third quarter, but no impact for the full year, and what you should read into that is that we are going to wait and see specifically when the service begins accepting returns to decide what the impact should be on our quarterly guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citigroup. Ken Wong - Citigroup: This is Ken Wong for Walter. Just a quick question around QuickBooks, are you guys hearing anything in terms of kind of how your QuickBooks ProAdvisor channel feels about the new online rollout? In the past we had heard it wasn't really something that they felt was a product good enough to recommend. I mean has that dynamic changed? Brad Smith : Yes, Ken, it has. In addition to some studies that have been produced out there in your industry where some of your peers have been polling the ProAdvisors, we also have our own Net Promoter results, and our Net Promoter results with QuickBooks Online for Accountant is up significantly with the new version of QuickBooks Online. And so we are getting very good feedback and I personally have been out at some of the major conferences and have been interacting with the accountants and getting their feedback directly, and I have to say, for a group of people who quite frankly for years were not pleased with our version of QuickBooks Online, that sentiment has not only swung to the positive but it has swung much more positively, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, than we had expected. So we are getting good feedback from the ProAdvisors right now about the online version of QuickBooks, not only for their clients but also for them. Ken Wong - Citigroup: Great. And then you guys mentioned the partnership with Square, just wondering when should we expect to see that go live, and then any concerns that this cannibalizes your existing payment offering? Brad Smith : I'm sorry, can you repeat that last part again? Ken Wong - Citigroup: Sure. I guess I'm just wondering on your partnership with Square, when should we expect that to go live and then any concerns that having that capability for your customers might cannibalize your own payment offerings? Brad Smith : Got it. First of all, the rollout of square, we have it live right now going out with QuickBooks Online, the new version. It's in a beta format. We will continue to roll that out more extensively as we're rolling out the new QuickBooks Online. So the teams have been working side-by-side to make that very seamless. In terms of cannibalization, we actually think this is very complementary. So our GoPayment product in the market, we're trying to focus very squarely against service-based businesses. That's about two thirds of the businesses in the U.S. that operate on wheels, they paint houses, they mow lawns, they clean pools, and that business \u2013 by the way GoPayment paying customers was up 19% in this past quarter. So that continues to be a nice complementary service to our payments offering. Where square is really helping us focus is they're going to be focusing on restaurants and retailers. So it's a typical point of presence sort of businesses, and we think between that offering and our own GoPayment offering and the fact that they all work with QuickBooks as an operating system, that this is going to be a net add to the total payments opportunity that we can provide to small businesses and we think it will be incremental to our business as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Wayne Johnson from Raymond James. Wayne Johnson - Raymond James : I realize that we are in the beginning stages of the QuickBooks Online rollout, the updated version if you will, the latest updated version, and you made comments about the three-step three-minute opportunity to convert traditional desktop users to the online version. Is there any kind of efficacy here, numbers that you could share with us? What are your expectations, what do you think we are going to be talking about six months from now, nine months from now? Just trying to get a sense of how it's tracking and what you are looking for? Brad Smith : Wayne, I can't tell you anything beyond what we have talked about at Investor Day, which is we have a multi-year forecast of what we think we can do in terms of doubling our small business base over the next five years, going from 5 million to 10 million, and we tried to break that down in sort of a waterfall to show how much of that come from the new QuickBooks Online which will be several million users over the next five years, taking that QuickBooks Online version globally which will also generate several million users, and then ultimately going after some pre-accounting customers which will round up the rest. And the early indicators I would tell you to keep an eye on will be to continue to look at the gross end subscribers quarter over quarter. We continue to see good early adoption and plus the attach rates to payroll and payments but we haven't laid out any sort of details that says, here's what you should expect in Q2, Q3, Q4 at the product level. We have built that into our guidance overall but we haven't broken it down over the next few quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Macdonald from First Analysis. Jim Macdonald - First Analysis : You mentioned on the call that you had a new unified health platform for TurboTax. Could you talk a little bit more about that and then also what does that mean for the live tax health this season? Brad Smith : Sure, Jim, we can. If you look at TurboTax historically, there were multiple places on the home screen where you could get help. You could go into frequently asked questions, you could look up an answer through a community we called it Wise Community, you got equipped on a phone monitor and call a rep or chat with a rep, a live call center agent, or you could go out to an expert through Live Tax Advice and it was confusing. Now what we have is basically one search box that's very visible in the upper right-hand corner of every page. You type in your question and there is a little drop-down shelf that comes out and it gives you the choice. It will give you the answers of the frequently asked questions right there, it will give you the ability to post that out to the community from right there, or it will give you the ability to talk live to either one of our agents or an expert, and so it is all in one simple place and it gives you sort of a multiple choice, set of options that you can look for, whichever one answers your question the fastest and most efficient. Tax Experts are embedded into that offering for certain SKUs and in other SKUs it won't be, it will actually be a part of just having a live community of our own agents answer the question. But that's what the unified health is designed to do. Just think of it as a single search box on the upper right-hand corner of our products. Jim Macdonald - First Analysis : And just as a follow-up, so what implications does that have on the size of your investment in the live tax help area? R. Neil Williams : We haven't talked about the exact amount specifically, Jim, but you can take away from this is it is going to be less than what is spent the last few seasons and that we'll be shifting more of that resource to product improvement and the buildout of products. Operator : Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore Partners. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Two questions. First, could you update us on your unit pricing strategy for FY 2014 both in the Small Business Group and the Consumer Group? Brad Smith : Okay. So the unit pricing for us in the Consumer Group hasn't been published yet, so we will talk about that when we get the product into the marketplace. We just don't want to be out ahead of our headlights here in terms of the pricing itself. In the Small Business Group, the product pricing for QuickBooks year-over-year is fairly consistent. There has been a modest uptick in our QuickBooks Enterprise pricing and we have a one user, two user, three user, four user, five user sort of SKU lineup and then we go up to 10 and 30 users and it's a very modest amount and so it's probably in the neighborhood of 7% to 10% depending on which one of those SKUs you're looking at. Everything else is pretty much the same in terms of desktop and online pricing. In payroll and payments, there is a lot of moving parts. We have simplified the pricing in both of those businesses. We try to make it much more transparent. In payroll, we have gone in and we basically have simplified it so you know what your price is on a per employee basis, and in payments we are doing the same thing. And so, there is a lot more moving parts to those two pieces but I would tell you it is much more around simplification and less around any sort of major changes in the pricing itself. David Togut - Evercore Partners : And as a quick follow-up question, when do you expect the new version of TurboTax to be released and what are the details of new features you expect to have in it? R. Neil Williams : The desktop version will be out around Thanksgiving and we had talked about some of the features around [indiscernible] returning users to retrieve their data and to have a much simpler experience. TurboTax Online would be out around the end of the calendar year, first part of next year, and TurboTax Online of course, the product you see at the beginning of the season won't necessarily be the product you see at the end because we are continuing to make improvements and iterations throughout the season, but it will focus on first-time filers and having a simpler easier to get started experience and also the recent enhancements in TurboTax Online for returning users as well, again to take advantage of data that we know from other customers like you or we know from your prior year returns that you filed with us. So those are the basic things you can expect in terms of TurboTax. Operator : Our next question comes from Yum Kim from Janney Capital. Yum Kim - Janney Capital : Brad, there has been a lot of focus on new customer acquisitions and those metrics showed strong growth numbers again this quarter across all business segments, so congrats on that, but how effective was cross-selling in the quarter especially around Demandforce product? Brad Smith : We actually are excited with the new customer acquisition. Demandforce this past quarter, subscribers were up 36%, the fastest growing vertical we have, and by vertical, they focus on dentist and then they focus on lifestyle and [indiscernible] and so on. We're calling the QuickBooks customer base a vertical because it is basically a pool of [indiscernible] that they can just sell again. They have continued refining through big data which of the customers in the small business base have the same characteristics as their existing customers in terms of size, business needs, and the revenue they generate and there's 650,000, they're going after about 225,000 now and that is the fastest-growing vertical they have in their portfolio. We haven't broken out the exact percentages of quarter over quarter but I can tell you in the grand context that the business is growing 36% and that being the fastest vertical, that it is growing at a very nice clip and we are very encouraged with the cross-sell opportunities of Demandforce into our base. Yum Kim - Janney Capital : Okay, great. So if I can follow-up on the question, at the Investor Day, you talked about focusing more on the lower end of the small business market trying to accelerate the new customer acquisition. So on that, has that focus started already and does that new customer add that you expect in the Small Business Group today, will that be different from your existing installed base? The question is really, would that focus on the low end of the market and change the market-based opportunity around cross-selling and up selling which has been your hallmark or the business model? Brad Smith : I am assuming this particular question is focused on the small business as large, not just on Demandforce. Yum Kim - Janney Capital : Yes. Brad Smith : Okay. Yes, our efforts have continued to accelerate in the lower end of the market. We have a small team of innovators that are working on a set of promising solutions that we think could be the first initial entrees into having a relationship with Intuit before you end up ultimately needing QuickBooks. I mentioned a few minutes ago, Mint MyBusiness which continues to accelerate through its beta phase and we will be looking to roll that out, and that's the ability to separate personal and business expenses, get tax times and ultimately file your taxes with TurboTax through a TPA. Our teams also have several other products like Weave which basically has to do with small businesses. That continues to pick up momentum. We have Snap Payroll, the ability to basically enter your hours and earnings from a phone and do your payroll for your small business while you're out on the road. And there is a whole host of other solutions the teams are testing. In terms of over the long-term, there will be different monetization models for these products. Each one of them will generate a different sort of revenue stream and then ultimately over time, our goal is to make the small business successful as they grow, and then when they do grow, they will move out into the ecosystem of other products where we can do things like payroll and maybe QuickBooks accounting for them. But for any individual products, each monetization model will be slightly different. If it's to do with, we may ultimately end up leading that into something like calendaring, we may end up leading that into something like payments. But we are making progress and I think over time we will have to see which one of these gets the best traction before we can answer the question specifically about what will be the best cross-sell opportunity for each product. Operator : Our final question for today comes from Michael Millman from Millman Research. Michael Millman - Millman Research : For this current year, fiscal 14, on taxes your models include ACA questions eHealth kind of questions or anything to raise the visibility of this coming event, and then I have another question? Brad Smith : Yes, Michael, it guess. Today in fact if you get to our website, all of our programs that support the Affordable Care Act have been up and running since the official opening in October. So you can go there today and you can get answers to your questions through the AnswerXchange. You can also link to eHealth, our partner, and you can learn more about the offerings. And so that is out there today for customers and it will continue to be out there as we rollout the new versions of the product for fiscal year 2014. Michael Millman - Millman Research : But will it be in the product if someone just goes to the product, will it be something in there that will say, heads up? Brad Smith : Yes, throughout the product we will make sure \u2013 first of all TurboTax Online and the web side are synonymous because once you get into the product, there are some things that perpetually move with you through the product, and the AnswerXchange is a key piece of that. Also we will make sure that we are reminding you at certain points in the tax prep itself, implications as it results from the Affordable Care Act, and we've only closed out at the end, we will also be giving you tips around how to think about next year as well. So yes, it is embedded into the product experience. Michael Millman - Millman Research : And for the coming year, do you expect any change in your RT share? Brad Smith : We continue to see strong demand in RT. It is a product that the consumers really like, the ability for them to pay for their tax software out of the refund. That continues to grow and we have that sort of trajectory built into this year's forecast. So our goal is to continue to accelerate the growth of that. Michael Millman - Millman Research : And is there any assumption to [indiscernible] over the next couple of years and any switches between do-it-yourself and assisted? Brad Smith : Switchers in terms of the total category growth? Michael Millman - Millman Research : Yes. Brad Smith : Yes, and what we have seen including this year is that the software category grew at about 3%, the CPAs were roughly flat, tax sourcing to be down a little bit year-over-year and when you model that out over the next few years, that continues to show the software category picking up a little bit of share out of the total number of filers that are filing, and we think that trend continues. Operator : Thank you. And that is all the time we have today for our Q&A session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Brad Smith : Okay, thanks Saeed. Clearly you can tell we are encouraged by the momentum that we have built coming out of this restructure that we went through back in August. I'll tell you our teams are hitting on all cylinders and we are looking forward to the peak season, which we know is quickly upon us here, but I do want to thank you for your time. I know there is a lot going on today in our space and so I just want to wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season and we'll speak with you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Saheed, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, now, I will turn the call over to Matt Rhodes, Intuit's Director of Investor relations. Mr. Rhodes, you may begin. Matt Rhodes : Thank you, sir. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Intuit's second quarter fiscal 2014 conference call. I'm here with Brad Smith, our President and CEO; Neil Williams, our CFO; and Scott Cook, our founder. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2013 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. As a reminder, all reported results excluded Intuit Financial Services and Intuit Health, which have been sold and reclassified to discontinued operations. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad Smith. Brad D. Smith: All right. Thanks, Matt, and thanks all of you for joining us. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $782 million, down 12% from last year. Now this reflects the shift of tax revenue into the third quarter. As a result, we raised our third quarter guidance and we reaffirmed our guidance for fiscal 2014. Before I drill into the details, let me begin by talking more broadly about a secular thing. A thing that is driving growth across all of our businesses, the adoption of Connected Services with favorable lifetime value economics and predictable recurring revenue streams. The move to the cloud powers our Connected Services strategy. It enables us to deliver awesome product experiences and allows us to leverage the contributions of others and it gives us the opportunity to capitalize on the data to create real customer delight. With our restructuring efforts that we executed this past summer, our teams are laser-focused and aligned against 2 strategic outcomes. First, to be the operating system behind Small Business success; and second, to do the nations taxes in the U.S. and Canada. We're successfully leading this platform shift to the cloud with our goal of adding 5 million Small Business customers and 20 million more tax filers over the next 5 years. We've made progress against these strategic goals since declaring them 6 months ago. Beginning with Small Business, our cloud solutions continue to build momentum. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 30% in the second quarter, accelerating versus last quarter. We added 45,000 net new customers in this past quarter alone. We're also seeing strong growth in QuickBooks Online, outside the United States where we have 46,000 subscribers, nearly double last year's base and accelerating from 80% growth last quarter. In parallel, we are early in the migration of our existing base of QuickBooks Online customers. Once customers are on the new version, the leading indicators are really promising, with attach rates of payments and payroll much improved versus the classic QuickBooks Online. And when you add in QuickBooks Desktop customers who have elected to pay us a recurring subscription fee, our total subscriber growth is now up 26%. Now moving beyond QuickBooks, Demandforce subscribers also grew 33%, and Intuit's Online Payroll subscribers grew 20%. On the marketing front, we've launched the new Small Business campaign that showcases the ease and versatility of the new QuickBooks Online and the supporting ecosystem of services. And all of this is occurring with the halo effect of our Small Business Big Game campaign, which was the biggest social program in our history. This campaign significantly raised Intuit's profile, generating more than 11 billion impressions in 7 months. We also made a small business's dream come true. We've got Goldieblocks, a 15-employee toy company from Oakland, California in front of the world with a commercial during the Big Game. Wrapping up our Small Business performance, we are powering through several proactive decisions as we aggressively position ourselves for the future. We're leaning into this new QuickBooks Online and as a result, the expected decline in QuickBooks Desktop units will continue as we create greater incentive and migration support to move these customers to a cloud-based solution. We've also shifted our strategic focus in payments to QuickBooks' merchants, and this is in support of our ecosystem approach, which simplified our processing model to ensure that we're delivering a superior value for the price and our revenue this quarter reflects this increased focus on our Small Business ecosystem. Neil will cover more of these details in a minute. But even with these transitional moves, our Small Business Online ecosystem continues to build momentum and we expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth in Small Business overall this year. Now let me move to tax. As we shared at the beginning of the fiscal year, the current season is our first step in a multiyear journey to redefine the tax preparation paradigm. And to radically simplify the tax prep experience. In particular, we remain focused on improving our share of the 70 million consumers who filed simple returns in the U.S. and Canada, many of whom were simply paying too much for their tax preparation. Let me share a few of the examples of product innovations that we already have in market this year for the individuals who are filing simple returns. For the first time, our free federal product transfers returning customers' personal information and their prior year tax data. This includes W-2 wage and salary information from their employer, and it drastically reduces the time it takes to complete a tax return. We've also executed targeted pricing actions in key time windows when these more simple filers will do their returns, and complemented our free federal product with a state product at $15. SnapTax, our mobile tax offering, is a favorite amongst these simple filers and is now available in both Spanish and English, and it includes an all-in price of $15 as well. Now for the broader tax base, we redesigned the online experience for our returning customers. We now offer a more personalized experience that adapts itself to a customer's unique tax situation and eliminates all unnecessary questions. The redesign highlights year-over-year changes to a customer's tax refund and provides easy-to-understand explanations for why their refund increased or decreased. These explanations not only eliminate any unnecessary confusion, they reduce the number of customer care calls. These product improvements are occurring within the context of a shift in our marketing efforts as well. While we're investing less in marketing year-over-year, we are approaching our programs with bolder execution and clearer positioning as the champion for the do-it-yourself tax filer. We received very positive reaction to our new ad campaign. It's amazing what you're capable of, which clearly demonstrates how TurboTax empowers people to take on their taxes with confidence and ease. So what does all this add up to? While it's very early in the season, but we're seeing good trends. We're seeing good trends in traffic, in conversion and in net promoter scores. And as we shared in our separate TurboTax release today, our units grew 7% through February 15 versus the comparable prior year period. Now realize what's in everybody's mind is, \"Well, who's winning?\" We're hot off the press, the public data from the IRS that was released today and reports the data through February 14, shows that the total self-prepared e-files are up 6.6%, which is a pretty decent proxy for the do-it-yourself software category. Now on a comparable basis through February 14, TurboTax e-filers were up 10%, which indicates we've gained some share. As a reminder, our next unit update will be at the end of April. Now on the Pro Tax side of the business, we've also seen strong early results in customer acquisition. E-files for our new Intuit Tax Online product have increased more than 40% year-to-date. We expect about 7% of our Pro Tax customers will use our file-based solutions over the course of this tax season. So I want to put a bow around our progress in the first half of the year. We're moving faster in the U.S. and globally, but we still have work to do. Our Small Business subscriber growth is accelerating and is driving double-digit revenue growth this year and beyond. And while it's still early in the tax year, I am really inspired by our team's work to reimagine the tax prep experience for both consumers and professional tax preparers. You'll see a lot more innovation from these teams over the coming months and years. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Neil, to walk you through the financial details. R. Neil Williams : Thanks, Brad. Let's start with overall company results. For the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we delivered revenue of $782 million, non-GAAP operating income of $17 million, GAAP operating loss of $46 million, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.02 and a GAAP loss per share of $0.13. Turning to the business segments, total Small Business group revenue grew 8% in the second quarter. Small Business Financial Solutions revenue grew 5%. QuickBooks revenue grew 12%; while payments revenue was flat. Customer acquisition in our online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 30%, accelerating from the first quarter; QuickBooks Desktop subscribers grew 19%; QuickBooks Enterprise subscribers grew 20%; QuickBooks Desktop units declined 9% versus last year. And as Brad mentioned, we expect Desktop units to decline and revenue growth from the Desktop ecosystem to slow as we continue to improve and emphasize QuickBooks Online. The good news here is that the lifetime value of QuickBooks Online customers is 40% higher than Desktop. Total paying QuickBooks customers were up 15% for the quarter, driven by the shift from Desktop units to subscriptions. Payments revenue was flat versus the year-ago quarter. Brad describes some of the strategic decisions we've made in Payments. Let me walk you through the numbers. As you can see on the factsheet, merchants grew 7% and card transaction volume grew 3%. One click down, our core QuickBooks Payment business is growing and certain non-core channels are declining. The numbers reflect the impact of strategic decisions we've made to drive customer growth. For example, over the past few years, our Payment's pricing structure has become less competitive. We've rolled out a simplified pricing plan that lets customers choose between a pay-as-you-go option with a clear rate per transaction or a plan with monthly fee and a lower discount rate. While we give up some near-term revenue because we have fewer merchants on plans with monthly fees, we believe more merchants and higher overall volume will more than make up for that over time. And we'll still have to grow over the nonstrategic business lines. These represent about 10% of the Payments business revenue. And in the second quarter, this nonstrategic revenue declined about 25%. In Small Business Management Solutions, revenue grew 16%. Employee Management Solutions revenue grew 14%, driven by strong growth in Online customers, as well as our assisted and full service offerings. Demandforce revenue grew 32%. One last point on Small Business, our guidance remains 10% to 12% revenue growth for the year. This growth is coming more from customers and mix improvement this year and less from price. Price drove about 5 points of growth last year and will only drive about 2 points this year. That's a much healthier mix and bodes well for continued customer growth as we move forward. Brad covered the tax update, and the numbers are in the press release. Let me just remind you that the Consumer Tax comparisons get a bit tougher in the back half of the year and our strategy this season is built to drive customer growth and share gains. This means customers may grow 1 point or 2 faster than revenue, which we think is a very healthy sign for the business long-term. Moving to our financial principles and capital allocation, we continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield 15-plus percent ROI. Our first priority is investing for growth in the business. So far this fiscal year, we've made 5 small acquisitions with a total investment of around $125 million. With [ph] this use of capital, we'll return cash to shareholders via share repurchases. We completed the repurchase of 1.4 billion of shares so far this fiscal year, and we have about $2 billion remaining on our authorization. As we've mentioned, we expect to reduce our share count 4% to 6% net in fiscal 2014, and we intend to be in the market every quarter. Our board approved a $0.19 dividend for fiscal Q3, payable on April 18. We've reiterated our guidance for fiscal 2014 and provided updated details on quarterly guidance to reflect the expected shift in tax revenue we mentioned in our press release. And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad D. Smith: All right. Thanks, Neil. So we've talked a lot about our strong Small Business results and our multiyear efforts to reimagine tax prep. Our aspiration to become the operating system behind Small Business success and to do the nation's taxes are bold strategic objectives. And I'll tell you that I have confidence in our ability to achieve these multiyear goals because of our company's commitment to creating an environment where the most talented employees can do the best work of their lives. It takes effort and investment to create a culture that operates like a 30-year-old start up and we continue to make advances each and every day. This commitment not only shows up in the kinds of products that we're delivering for our customers, but it's acknowledged in the war for top talents, where Intuit has been ranked for the 13th year in a row on Fortune Magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work For list. This year, we've broken into the top 10 at #8, our highest ranking ever. We have lots of opportunity in front of us and we remain deeply committed to accelerating customer and revenue growth, but it all starts with great people, and I could not be more proud of the Intuit team. With that, let's open it up to you to hear what's on your mind. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Brad, if you could just touch on Online, on the tax side, and maybe give us some more color what you're seeing so far this year? And also, if you could just bring us up to speed on QuickBooks outside the U.S. I know you had a really good growth rate, can you give us a sense of what your priorities are this year in that business? Brad D. Smith: Yes, I sure can, Brent. Thanks for the questions. First of all, in tax online, we are very encouraged by the early results. As you know, there are 2 peak periods in tax season, that first period is around end of January, early February when people get their W-2s, and then the last peak is April 14 and 15. Coming to that first peak, we are growing faster than the category and perhaps faster than the market overall. And with 11% unit growth in TurboTax Online, we're very encouraged with the results we're seeing. Now we mentioned this is the first year of a multiyear journey, we're making big changes to the product. We're changing our approach to marketing and we're improving our customer care experience, and the team continues to innovate every week, so we expect to continue to learn and adjust as we go. But so far, what we see happening now is that our performance in the market is not only helping customers get a better experience, it's helping us grow faster than the market, at least through the first half of the season. Now I'll move to the QuickBooks question and talk about QuickBooks Online outside the U.S. We currently have 46,000 paying subscribers outside the United States that is basically double where we were last year. And we continue to see strong momentum as we're adding feature functionality in respective countries. Now as you may remember, we're focused on 4 countries, primarily, right now, that's Canada, the U.K., Australia and India, and in each of those 4 countries, we continue to sign strategic partnerships with third-party developers who help us round out our portfolio of features. And in other areas we're actually introducing features that we're building ourselves. And so we're continuing to pick up momentum and we anticipate that we will start to look at other countries beyond these 4, and it will all be enabled by one thing that separates us from our competition. We have the first truly global-ready platform that can be localized by a third-party and an end-user in any country in which customers want to use the product. We now have paying customers in over 190 countries. So while we're focused on 4, we are seeing adoption in other countries and that's helping us choose where we're going to double down in terms of the next countries we go after. So that's really the headline on the Global QuickBooks Online momentum. Operator : And our next question comes from Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities. Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : So it sounds like a part of the inflection point in QuickBooks Online is that you're now going out to your Desktop customers, existing customers, and having them switch. Can you talk a little bit about how that's been going so far? Are you getting good conversion rates in terms of getting the customers to convert? Is the process going smoothly as you wanted, is this something you're going to continue to push? Brad D. Smith: Yes, Gil. So we're very early in the journey. It is now available to all QuickBooks Desktop and QuickBooks Online customers. We currently have about 12% of the QuickBooks Online base that has moved over to the new QuickBooks Online, so it's really still pretty early. But the results we're getting are very positive. We're getting great feedback, the Net Promoter Scores are higher. And from our perspective, the benefit is it reduces the friction between additional services. So I'll give you a couple of data points. The attach rates for payments to QuickBooks Online is 50% higher in the new version of QuickBooks Online than it was the classic version. The Payment attach rate is also higher, up about 6%, and so when you put those things together, you're seeing a better product experience with also the addition to sell additional services, and that's a big win for the customer and that's a big win for us. Operator : And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citigroup. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Brad, I'm wondering -- just expanding on that last question, I'm wondering if you can talk about what measures you might take to sort of lean in harder to that transition of potentially drive the base towards online more aggressively than you are today, and how you're thinking about potentially making that choice? Brad D. Smith: Yes, I'll be happy to do that, Walter. It really falls into 3 buckets. First and foremost, is we want to make sure that the feature functionality in QuickBooks Online is the feature the customer is currently using in Desktop, if they're moving from Desktop. And so we've been working on our Online Banking fees and reconciliation capabilities. And we're also strengthening inventory for those companies that are product-based businesses. Beyond that, we want to make sure that it's a seamless, frictionless migration. And so we've got a 3-step, 3-minute conversion program that will move your data out of the prior version of QuickBooks and into the new QuickBooks Online, and we're also backing that up with incentives. Creating an economic incentive for you to move into the new QuickBooks Online and get used to the new look and feel, and then, over time, we're seeing that those Net Promoter Scores really tend to accelerate for those customers. In terms of incentives internally, the general manager for the QuickBooks Desktop business has one goal, and that goal is to incentivize the customers to move to a subscription-based version of Desktop or to move to the new QuickBooks Online. And so we've got the entire organization motivated to help the customers get to this new cloud-based version because we just see it as a much better solution for them, and we're working very hard to accelerate the decline of the Desktop units and the increase of our cloud-based units. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And, Neil, just a follow-up on that, do you see any quantifiable headwind in terms of the Small Business growth rate in your fiscal year to this fiscal year as you look towards next fiscal year as a result of pushing harder here? R. Neil Williams : Not really, Walter. I think that you're seeing some headwind this year and last year. And I think you've seen that reflected as the one-off sales of QuickBooks Desktop units decline. So I think we've been monitoring that as we go through. If we get the customer growth accelerated and the customer counts up, I'm not overly concerned about what happens to revenue in a period-to-period basis, I think you'll be able to see that with much better transparency and predictability, as we move these customers to subscription-based offerings. Operator : And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Brad, I just wanted to ask your thoughts on what this new promo for this date version of tax return is doing in terms of drawing customers. Are you seeing new customers come in? Then I guess what has been so far the early read on that? Brad D. Smith: Yes, thanks, Kartik. Let me first put it into some context. So when we entered this year, we said it was going to be the first year of a multiyear journey to make the product drop dead simple and try to eliminate 7 billion hours of tax preparation drudgery that this country goes through ever year, whether it's for a professional, to be able to just review a return, or for a consumer to basically ask as few a questions as possible and get their return done. And so we're making very strong strides in the first year of that multiyear effort. Our teams improved the product. We have the best free federal product we've ever had, and now it includes that prior-year imported information and the ability to import your W-2, so you have very few questions to answer. And we also said we wanted to focus this year's efforts on the 70 million people who have relatively simple returns. Now as we've looked at it, we see that some of these people tend to file earlier in the season and they also tend to be price-sensitive. And so we tested things, in addition to the great product experience we've created, which is not easy to copy, we've also tested what is the right price value proposition to go out and win those customers. And you saw some of that during the late January, early February timeframe. The result has been very encouraging for us. The fact that we're growing our units 11% online, the fact that our total efile units, in a comparable period to the IRS, is up faster than the category, suggest that not only is it doing the things we wanted it to do, it's also producing the kinds of outcomes for customers. The traffic's up, the conversion's up, and the Net Promoter Scores were up year-over-year for the customer's experience as well. So while we still have a lot of season left to play -- yet to play, we like the results we've got out of this program in the first half. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : So, Brad, would you say, incrementally, are you seeing a lot more new customers because of this new strategy? Brad D. Smith: The answer to that question is yes. We are getting more new customers into the franchise. We also see, as we look at our sources of customers, we're getting more customers from other software players. So we continue to take from tax stores, but we're getting a higher proportion of first-time filers and we're also getting more customers from other software providers. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Okay. And then just one clarification, on the factsheet, when you put out QuickBooks Online subscribers, will those be -- will those include trial, as well as paid? Or is it all paid and no trial? Brad D. Smith: It's all paid, no trial. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Joshua Siber - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : It's Joshua Siber on for Scott. With TurboTax efilings up more than the IRS efilings, would you infer that you're taking market share from other channels? Or pulling forward within the DIY channel? Brad D. Smith: Josh, right now, with the data we have, we believe that we are taking share early in the season, but we also recognize that as the rest of the season plays out, there's a whole lot of time left on the clock and so we're going to have to remain focused and aggressive and continue to push new product innovation and different kinds of focused marketing efforts to the back half. But we don't think that this is a pull forward and, in fact, what we see is a whole bunch of people still yet to file, that procrastination trend continues year-over-year. And so for the people who have filed so far, we think we've got a disproportionate share relative to the category. Joshua Siber - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay. And would you be able to break out the TurboTax volume and efiles between U.S. and Canada? Brad D. Smith: I'm looking at Matt to see if we produced that on the factsheet here, so give me 1 second. Matt Rhodes : It's on the factsheet, but only through the 31st of January. Let me follow up with you after the call on that. Joshua Siber - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just one more if you don't mind, how are you guys comparing, year-over-year, for refund transfers and also for mobile filings? Brad D. Smith: I can talk to the mobile filings. So far, we're actually seeing an increase of almost 3x over this time last year in terms of people that are logging in through either a tablet or a phone, to not only start their tax return but complete it. Now last year, a total of 5 million people for the entire season went in and did their taxes on, started on a mobile device and then completed their taxes. But we're seeing a significant increase this year of people coming in and using a phone or a tablet to do their taxes. In terms of the refund transfer, I'm just going to look at Neil or Matt, to see if we've got any information we'd share at this point. R. Neil Williams : We really haven't shared any information on that, Brad, and probably we're not going to get into that, Josh, at this time. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Macmillan from Jefferies. Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Maybe first on tax, Brad. The comment you made about more volume this year, relative to price, and that revenue could be slightly lower than volume, is that relating, primarily, to what you're doing with free federal, with state and the sort of lower price on state for that product? Or is it a broader mix shift across the product portfolio? And if so, what's driving that? Brad D. Smith: Yes, Ross. So I'll go back at what we tried to articulate over the last few years is, our preferred method of growing a healthy tax business is to expand the DIY category to get more people into doing their taxes with software and then to take a disproportionate share of that category, so the continued growth of TurboTax share. To do that, we've always said the healthiest indicator of a strong business is to grow units faster than revenue. Because if we do that, we're getting customers in, then we know over the lifetime of their taxes, they start to get more complicated, they move up the product line and we're able to increase the revenue per return over multiple years. And so our goal going into this year was exactly the same goal that it has been for the last several, which is, let's grow our units faster than our revenue. And we think, with the new product innovation we have this year, and in particular, we have a great free federal product, where we also have a new experience for returning TurboTax customers, and for also paid simple filers. And it's the combination of all of those that we believe are contributing to growing our units at the pace that we are right now. And we would be very happy if we end up this year with our units growing several points faster than our revenue. Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Maybe one follow up. Great performance on QuickBooks Online subscriber ads, that's a really nice acceleration. Neil commented that the uplift in lifetime value is about 40%. From my recollection, I thought the number was a bit higher than that. I wonder if you could just frame that 40% for us, is it just looking at a particular cohort of customers or is there some other dynamic as you think about that value uplift per customer? R. Neil Williams : Ross, it primarily comes from the selling price of QuickBooks Online, as well as the ease of attach that Brad mentioned earlier. So those are the 2 drivers. It's a little -- maybe a bit more than 40%, but it's close. Brad D. Smith: Ross, I'll add one thing. I added a couple of these anecdotes a few minutes ago around the new version of QuickBooks Online, which you know we returned -- we refer to it inside as Harmony. The neat thing about the leading indicators on the new QuickBooks Online is the people who go from trial to a paid subscription, when they move to the new version, that's actually a 6% lift in trial to sub, that's a pretty big conversion improvement. Then when you look at the attach rates, the people who are actually attaching our merchant services, our Payments business, that's up 50% versus the old QuickBooks Online. And the Payroll number is actually up a little over 5%. So not only do you get a higher selling price, as Neil said, we're getting a better traffic to a paid subscription conversion and we're getting higher attach rates. And so all those lead to the higher lifetime value. Operator : And our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Macquarie. Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research : Brad, on Consumer Tax, you've talked about the opportunities to drive better conversion. And I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about season-to-date, how you're doing in this regard. And specifically, can you also comment on CPA Select and the traction that you're seeing there in helping to convert prospects that might otherwise drop out and head to a tax store? Brad D. Smith: Yes, I can, Brad. I'll start first on TurboTax Online and conversion. So, as you know, we have not had a traffic problem with TurboTax Online. In fact, we get about 1/2 of all America coming into TurboTax Online through a tax season. And so that's the significant amount of traffic. We just haven't always converted that traffic into paid users. This year, with the changes the team has made not only to the website, but more importantly to the product experiences, we are getting a higher conversion rate on our traffic right now. And so that's been positive news for us. In addition to that, we're continuing to release new innovative versions of the product every week. So the team hasn't gone into code freeze, they continue to innovate, they learn, they run A/B tests and they're continuing to optimize conversions. And we're seeing higher Net Promoter Scores. Right now, it's 4 to 6 points higher than it was last year for our online version of our product, and that's a pretty significant improvement year-over-year. So I'm proud of what the team is doing. At the same time, we're constructively dissatisfied and there's still a lot of time left in the season. We're going to continue innovating the product. In terms of CPA Select, TurboTax team is working with our sister division in Pro Tax. This year, we are in a full live beta of this test. We have 550 CPAs. And currently, the customers that start out in TurboTax and end up going to one of those CPAs to finish their return, having Net Promoter Score that is 25 points higher than simply the pro category overall. And so while it's just in beta and I want to manage expectations, we lack the early results of this experiment. And if we continue to see these results, we'll continue to lean into this as we look forward to next year. Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research : That's very helpful, Brad. And if I can ask one quick one of Neil. Neil, just following Walter's question and some of the other questions about leaning into QuickBooks Online and migrating the Desktop base, can you maybe share the mix of online versus Desktop that's embedded in your full-year guidance? R. Neil Williams : We still assume that in 2014, roughly 1/2 of all new customers would go to QuickBooks Online, 1/2 to Desktop. That's a big shift from, maybe, 3 or 4 years ago, where maybe we're looking 5% to 10% of new customers came in to QuickBooks Online. This year it's about 1/2 and 1/2. Operator : And our next question comes from Jim MacDonald from First Analysis. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : On the total overall filers for tax season this year, what are your expectations? I noticed they are up early, but maybe down in the data today. Brad D. Smith: Yes, Jim. We're still pegging somewhere between 0 and 1%. I think you probably, at this point, had a chance to see some of the data we saw that last year, there was a little bit of a recovery and the total IRS filings ended up being down about 0.1%, so it was relatively flat. The hypothesis we all had in the industry, things that have been validated by the IRS commissioner who just testified in February in front of Congress for the House Ways and Means subcommittee that the IRS continues to get better at catching fraudulent returns. And last year, they stopped and rejected about 6.7 million returns, and that was up from 5 million in the prior year and 3 million in 2011. So I think what you're seeing right now and what our expectations are, is the total number of people filing will probably go somewhere between flat to up about 1%, and that's what we've built into our guidance. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : Great. And just a follow-up, so the -- did the final revenue shift, I know you just preannounced last week, but was that still the $120 million you talked about last week? Brad D. Smith: It was. Operator : Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : In terms of -- in the Consumer Tax, the pricing that you're using to expand the category, are you able to quantify that? In other words, are you able to prove that you are expanding the category and bringing in more of those simple filers versus just simply stealing market share from other software providers in what might be considered a price [Audio gap] Brad D. Smith: Yes. Sterling, I lost you on the back half, but I think I got the question, which is, are you able to show you're expanding the category versus simply stealing share and what could be, I think, a price war, is that what you were suggesting? Or a price -- you may want to repeat the last question. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Yes, so just making sure that you're expanding the category and capturing a bigger sub category versus just making this a price competition? Brad D. Smith: I got it. Thank you. Well, first and foremost, the way anyone's going to win in this category is not price because the lowest price in the category is free and everyone has a free version out there already. The way you win in this category is to give somebody the simplest experience and getting them the maximum refund, and that's where our first year of a multiyear effort is to completely reimagine how we do that and to set the standard for everyone in the industry. And so that's where our focus is. The second is, there's been some emphasis on this particular call on the low-end of our product lineup, but if you take a look at it, we actually took a hard step back this past year and said, \"We need to make sure we get the right customers in the right products.\" And so we made changes to all of our product line. We removed some of the forms you use to be able to do in the middle part of the product line, and we moved it up to the higher tier, because that's really the right product for the customer. And so we're seeing mix where some customers are moving from the middle of the product up to the premier line. And we're also getting a better free product out in the marketplace to basically win and grow the category there as well. The only thing I can give you to answer your question today is the data that's been published by the IRS, because no one else has reported. And what they would suggest is that the do-it-yourself category is up 6.6% and the assisted and pro category is down 5.4%. So if you put that together with the programs we have in place, that suggests that the category is growing and it's taking share from the alternative methods. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Got it. No, it's great. And then in terms of -- on the Small Business side, you talked about maintaining the double-digit outlook for the full year. Does that mean that we should see a bounce back in the growth rates starting next quarter? Or is it going to be even more back-end loaded in terms of how we get to that 10% to 12%? R. Neil Williams : Sterling, this is Neil. Really, the only thing that was off of the double-digit growth in Q2 was Payments. The comps get a lot easier for Payments in the back half of the year and we expect the benefits of simplified pricing and more customers on new QuickBooks Online to bring our active use back up. So yes, we think the comps get a little easier in the back half. Operator : Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe from Morgan Stanley. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Maybe just to make sure I'm clear on that last point. On the Payment side, I guess the first question is either when we initially got the 10% to 12% guidance, was the negative impact in payments kind of contemplated in that guidance or was that something different than what you'd expected? And then just parsing through the response to the last question, is the expectation that the Payments business will return to a more normalized growth level in the back half of the year or do we need to see acceleration in some of the other business lines to get to the 10% to 12% SMB guidance for the year? R. Neil Williams : Yes. Thanks, Jennifer. I would tell you the softness in Q2 is probably a little bit more than we'd anticipated in Payments when we originally set guidance. But on the other hand, some of the other components of the category have performed better than we thought. So that's why we're reaffirming guidance and we feel pretty good about it. In the payments category, specifically, it's going to take us a bit to grow over some of these nonstrategic components of the portfolio. I could see it getting back to high single-digits or mid single-digits by the end of the year. It's not going to be a double-digit grower for this year in my view. But it's just getting back to those type levels put us solidly in the guidance range we've given for the category overall. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then just one quick one on tax, I think one of the big discussion points coming into tax season was what impact the early -- earliest leanings of the Affordable Care Act might have on consumer behavior and how they approach tax season. And obviously, you all have a partnership with eHealth on that front. Has there been anything notable to talk about around how ACA is impacting the tax season you've seen so far? Brad D. Smith: Jennifer, there has been, and I appreciate the question. First and foremost is, we're seeing no observed behavior of a customer wanting to switch their tax prep method because of the Affordable Care Act. That was our hypothesis because we looked at what had happened when Massachusetts had rolled this out years ago. And we saw no shift in behavior to someone moving from one method to another. Our own surveys heading into this tax season suggested that less than 1% of customers said they would actually be inclined to go someplace else because of the Affordable Care. But that didn't eliminate the need for us to be able to make sure that we do for health care what we do for taxes, which is take a very complicated law and make it drop dead simple so you understand the implications to you and we help you take action as a result. So we watched TurboTax help. We've had over 3 million consumers visit it so far this season. Over 600,000 of them were uninsured and we've helped them understand the implications through a free tool, how Affordable Care impacts them, whether they qualify for a subsidy or they may potentially have a penalty. And we can route those who want health care to the eHealth partnership that we have. And so right now what I can tell you is, Affordable Care has been out there, the do-it-yourself category is growing fast. The assisted category is not growing so far this year, and our results seem to be very healthy and so we feel like Affordable Care is something we needed to address, and we have, but we don't see it causing any shift in the marketplace. Operator : And your next question comes from Michael Millman from Millman Research. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : More on tax. Considering the big difference between the tax pros and the self-prepared at the IRS -- the current IRS numbers, to what extent do you think weather is playing a major part in this? And I guess 2 ways : one, possibly, at home -- keeping people at home, can't get to the stores; and maybe, two, once they're home they might decide to do their tax -- their online tax earlier. And sort of related to that, to what extent might they decide we're never going to get out of the snow, let's go to online. Brad D. Smith: Yes. Thanks, Michael. Spoken like a true man from the Midwest and the Northeast, who've had to live through some of this. I appreciate it. First and foremost, I think that weather is clearly going to have some impact on everyone from retail to someone who may be doing tax store returns. I would want to step back and put a little bit of context around that, though. First, last year, without those kind of weather conditions, the do-it-yourself tax prep category grew 4.6% and the assisted, which means going to a store, or pro, grew 1.2%. And that was the continuation of a 10-year trend. So there is a shift to people wanting to do things online. I think, in this particular case, this is the first 2 reports from the IRS, there may be a more exacerbated version of that happening because of weather. But the key is, if they stayed home to file their taxes, they're not going to be filing them a second time. So those are customers that we've now got and they won't be in the mix between now and April 15. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : And so related to the growth you just mentioned last year, to -- the assisted people continue to talk about the 60-40 split, do you have a different measurement? Brad D. Smith: No. We actually see today that about 60% of people today go to a CPA or they go to a tax store. If you look at that data and then you break it out, it looks like the CPA segment's growing about 1%, 1.5%. The tax stores are relatively flat, they tend to be fighting amongst themselves in terms of units from what we can get from their public data. And then the one category that's growing is the do-it-yourself category, which continues to grow in the 3% to 5% range each and every year. And so right now, there is a snapshot in time that says 60-40. I think if these trends continue, you're growing to see that continue to shift because growing 4x faster will eventually start to shift the landscape more into the software category. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Since we've had this 40-60 for some time, that suggests that there's been, mostly, a shift from paper to electronic. Do you see that as being done with? Brad D. Smith: Well, I think, as you know really well, you follow this category closely, we're down to mid-single-digit number of people filing with paper and pencil, and we've been there for the last couple of years. And that didn't slow down the 4x growth rate over the assisted model last year. And if you look at the early results this year, it's growing even faster. So I think even with manual relatively gone out of 140 million people to be down to 5 million or 6 million and still be growing 4x faster, I think that's a misperception. Operator : And our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Two quick questions. First, if you think about the benefit you get from the new QuickBooks Online product and the re-acceleration. At the moment, so we went out like 2 quarters ago was 28% unit growth, then it was 29%, now it's 30%. How do we have to think about it? Do you think there's going to be a step change or is that kind of a slow progression towards higher numbers? And what do you think is a number that you can achieve there? That's the first one. And then on Payments, can you just talk me through like what triggered the changes on the pricing? Obviously, you've been in the Payment business for quite a while, so has there been a change in the competition that you're somehow started to look like you were losing share and you needed to make the changes? Or what was driving it? Brad D. Smith: So let me start with QuickBooks Online, and I appreciate calling out the quarter-over-quarter acceleration because that's what we're seeing. We do believe you're going to continue to see an acceleration because we're very early in getting customers over to the new QuickBooks Online. I mentioned a few minutes ago, only 12% of our current QuickBooks Online customers have moved to the new version. Now we haven't put any forecast out there that say what will that number accelerate to, we've just built that into our overall Small Business guidance. But I will tell you that we are committed to accelerating the growth of QuickBooks Online in the U.S. and globally, and also getting customers off the Desktop and into this new cloud-based version. In terms of payments, Neil mentioned just a few minutes ago, and I would tell you that one of the things that we achieved with the restructuring this past summer, as we put the Payments team right next to the QuickBooks team, they're now managed by one leader. Because really, customers think about their money in and their money out as one set of activities. And as we sat down and got underneath why customer growth was what it was, we discovered that we had allowed ourselves to lean too heavily on price. In fact, last year about 10 points of our Payments growth came from price. What we've now realized we needed to do was customers wanted 2 options. They wanted a pay-as-you-go model and they didn't want a monthly fee, they just wanted a per-transaction. And then we had another group that actually was willing to pay a monthly fee and then have a lower discount rate. And so by introducing that, we're giving up some short-term revenue, but we're actually starting to see an acceleration of people signing up for merchant services, and I'll give you a data point. The merchant -- the Payment services attached to QuickBooks Online is up 37% this quarter. And so by moving it into the new version of QuickBooks Online and by changing the pricing model, we're getting a re-acceleration of our merchants. And we think, over time, that will lead to higher volume as well. So what we basically did is we realized that we had leaned too heavily on price and we needed to get back to having a seamless experience with a set of pricing options for the customer. Operator : Gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions at this time. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad D. Smith: Yes, Saheed. Thank you. I want to thank everybody for your questions. I realize there's a lot of moving parts going on out there with the IRS data coming out hot off the press and our announcement a couple of weeks ago to try to help people understand the shift. I'd just put a bow around it by telling you we've come out of the first half of this fiscal year strong. I like our momentum, I like our plans, I like the fact our teams are continuing to lean in and innovate every week. We still have a lot of time left on the clock, so we're not going to let up, and we're looking forward to closing out this year the way we started it. And I'll look forward to speaking with each of you when we see you out on the road in the next couple of weeks. Or for those I don't see, we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon my name is Sa-il, and I will be your conference facilitator at this time. I would now like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now like to turn the call over to Matt Rhodes, Intuit's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rhodes, you may begin. Matt Rhodes : Thank you, sir. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Intuit's third quarter fiscal 2014 conference call. I'm here with Brad Smith, our President and CEO; and Neil Williams, our CFO.  Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2013 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.  Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. As a reminder, all reported results exclude Intuit Financial Services and Intuit Health, which have been sold and reclassified to discontinued operations. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad Smith. Brad Smith : All right. Thanks, Matt, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $2.4 billion, up 14%. Overall, I feel very good about our performance. Let me begin by sharing my reflections on the quarter, starting with our Consumer Tax business. In the U.S., TurboTax Online units grew 14%, and total TurboTax units grew 10% for the season. Both results were double last year's growth rates. Our investment in product improvements paid off across the board, and we now expect Consumer Tax revenue to grow about 7% for the fiscal year, handily beating the original guidance of 4% to 5%. Our goals this year were to accelerate growth in the DIY digital category, acquire and retain more customers, and take share. We succeeded on all fronts. As we regularly discuss, there are 4 main drivers of growth for TurboTax. I'll walk through each of these drivers and I'll highlight how we performed versus our expectations. Total returns received by the IRS grew slightly faster than our expectation of a 0.5 point. The DIY software category gained about 1.5 points of share from alternative methods, compared to the 1% that we had expected. In fact, IRS data show that DIY e-file growth was up more than 6%, contrasted with the assisted e-file being up less than 1% for the season.  Within the DIY software category, improvements in our TurboTax product and our go-to-market execution drove a gain of about 2 points a share. Our plan was to win share within the context of a multiyear journey towards our ultimate product vision. But we made great strides this season, focusing on improved experiences for new filers with simple returns and for returning users. And finally, while we delivered revenue growth above our guidance range and achieved our goal of growing our customer base several points faster than revenue, the end result was a decrease in revenue per customer of about 3 points for the season. This was expected, as we sought to build a strong foundation for the future through category and unit growth.  While these are compelling metrics, I'm most proud of the results we generated on our product investments and our end-to-end experience improvements. We spent 10% less on TurboTax marketing versus last year, yet we increased traffic and both conversion and retention improved. In addition, our support calls declined by more than 20% and our Net Promoter Scores improved as well. While our primary goal was to take share this season, these products investments and an effective marketing strategy, drove Consumer Group margin expansion as well.  On the ProTax side of the business, we had strong new customer growth in our higher value offerings. And while we're still in the early days of delivering our ultimate online product vision for the professional accountants, our Intuit Tax Online units grew double digits as well. As you're going to see in our updated guidance, we expect the ProTax business to come in at the high end of the range. Now shifting to Small Business, our cloud solutions continue to build momentum and our subscriber growth is accelerating.  QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 36% in the third quarter to 624,000, adding more than 60,000 net customers in the past quarter. QuickBooks Online subscribers outside the U.S. were up more than 130% to 64,000, further accelerating from the 90% growth last quarter. Total QuickBooks subscriber growth, which includes QuickBooks desktop and Enterprise plans, grew 30%. And we're quickly approaching the 1 million subscribers milestone. And last, but not least, Intuit Online Payroll subscribers also grew 23%. Each of these growth rates represents an acceleration from the prior quarter, and we are quite pleased with the ongoing success of our online ecosystem.  As we look ahead, our goal is to win every new small business customer and to win every cloud decision with the new QuickBooks Online. In service to this goal, we expect our desktop units to decline, and that is a trend that continued once again this quarter. On the payments front. As we mentioned last quarter, we shifted our strategic focus to QuickBooks merchants which support our ecosystem approach. We improved our payments integration within QuickBooks and we simplified our pricing. More than 80% of new customers are now selecting our pay-as-you-go pricing model instead of paying a fixed monthly fee. As a result, our current period growth rates are being impacted by these decisions. But we think these are good decisions, as we've realized our pricing to be more competitive and we've consciously shifted away the emphasis from the non-core payments businesses. Even with the strategic repositioning of our Payments business and the business model shift to the cloud in QuickBooks, we continue to expect Small Business revenue growth at 10% this year.  So to put a bow around our progress so far, the secular shift to the cloud is powering our strategy. We're delivering awesome product experiences, we're leveraging the contributions of others and we're capitalizing on data to deliver real customer delight. Executing against this strategy, we won this tax season. And on the Small Business side, our subscriber growth in the online ecosystem continues to accelerate, both domestically and globally.  So with that overview, I'll turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details. R. Williams: Thanks, Brad. Let's start with overall company results. For the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we delivered revenue of $2.4 billion, up 14%; non-GAAP operating income of $1.56 billion, up 16%; GAAP operating income of $1.49 billion, up 17%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.53, up 20%; and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.39, up 25%.  As you know, these growth rates reflect revenue shifting from our second quarter to the third fiscal quarter. Now turning to the business segments. Total Small Business group revenue grew 8% in the third quarter. Within Small Business, Small Business Financial Solutions revenue grew 4%, QuickBooks revenue grew 7%, while Payments revenue was flat. Our financial performance reflects our ongoing strategic shift toward our online ecosystem and core payments offerings. Customer acquisition in our online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 36%, QuickBooks Desktop subscribers grew 22%, QuickBooks Enterprise subscribers grew 18%. QuickBooks desktop units declined 12% versus last year, as we continue to lead with our online ecosystem. The shift in business model and the acceleration of QuickBooks Online growth, combine to lower Small Business revenue growth by about a point this fiscal year.  Payment Solutions revenue was flat. One click down in payments, we continue to see diverging trends in our core and non-core businesses. QuickBooks payments revenue grew 5%, driven by increased adoption of our cloud solutions. Revenue from our non-core Payments business declined about 20%, and these non-core businesses represent about 10% of total payments revenue. Small Business Management Solutions revenue grew 16%. Employee Management Solutions revenue grew 13%, driven by strong growth in online customers across do-it-yourself and assisted offerings. Demand for subscribers grew 44%, including the recent acquisition of CustomerLink. Subscribers grew 28% organically.  Within the Consumer group, Consumer Tax revenue grew 14% versus the third quarter last year, driven by customer growth. As Brad mentioned, our margins improved nicely this season. While I'm pleased with the performance, we expect to continue to invest in the product experience and to prioritize growth in share and customers above margin expansion over the long term.  Our ProTax business also had a great season, with much of our customer growth coming in our higher value solutions. ProTax revenue was $334 million, up 32%, reflecting the shift in large part from Q2 to Q3. Year-to-date revenue growth in ProTax is about 3%. As a reminder, we made some changes to our ProTax offering that will shift revenue into the fourth quarter of this year and fiscal 2015.  Moving to our financial principles. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield 15% plus return on investment. With over $2 billion in cash on our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for growth in the business. We also look for M&A opportunities. And through the third quarter, we've made 6 acquisitions totaling approximately $155 million. When it's the best use of our cash, we'll return it to shareholders via share repurchases. We repurchased $23.4 million of shares in the third quarter and about $2 billion remains on our authorization. We expect to reduce our share count by about 4% net this year. And our Board approved a $0.19 dividend for the fiscal fourth quarter, payable on July 18. We provided our updated guidance for the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2014 in our press release. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brad to close. Brad Smith : Thank you, Neil. So we're pleased with our strong finish to the tax season. We grew the digital category, took share and plan to come in above the high end of our original revenue guidance range in Consumer Tax. However, as we shared before, we're just getting started. It will be a multiyear effort to reimagine the tax preparation experience, but our teams are already working on the product for next season. On the Small Business side, our momentum continues to build and our transition to the cloud continues to accelerate, driving value for customers and for Intuit. We see a lot of opportunity in front of us, and we remain deeply committed to accelerating customer and revenue growth. And with that, we'll turn it over to you for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Peter Goldmacher from Cowen. Peter Goldmacher : So you guys talked a lot all season about how you were going to take a half a step back from tax and really start working on the product. And you sacrificed -- you held pricing flattish to gain share. Can you talk about what we should expect next year? I don't need guidance, but do you think that you have -- you guys brought in enough customers this season that even if you hold pricing flat, you can get that growth again? And what happens with the product? And then talk a little bit about your learnings in tax and how they apply to the Small Business products? Brad Smith : Okay, Peter. Thanks for the question. So first of all, yes, we believe this year sets the foundation for a strong future next year. And the reason being has got a couple of pieces to it. First of all, the way that we see continuing to grow the franchise is to first expand and accelerate the do-it-yourself category. And it's been running in the 3% to 5% growth range. And this year, we've got it up over 6%. The second is we know if we bring customers into the franchise, next year, they tend to come in and not only do they use our product, but many times their taxes get more complicated and they move up the product line. And that's good news for us in terms of customer growth in revenue. Behind that, we've also gotten a lot of really good learnings this year on product improvements. The team made big improvements to our classic TurboTax product. We've got a lot of good advances around simple returns and returning user experiences. And we were able to take that learning and build it into our go-forward plans for next year. So we think the product will be even stronger. And when you put that together, the reason why we have the confidence that I'm communicating now, is because we saw all the key indicators move up and to the right. The category expanded. We picked up share. Our conversion was up. Our retention's up almost 200 basis points. And our Net Promoter Scores improved to 4 to 6 points on each of the products. So we actually feel very good that those are positive leading indicators to next year. Peter Goldmacher : Brad, let me ask you -- let me just stay on this topic because you're making a really interesting point here. Do you think next year, if you have the opportunity to keep pricing flat and grow your share again? Is that something that's interesting to guys? Or do you feel like -- do you feel compelled to deliver more revenue, more revenue growth rather than unit growth? Brad Smith : Yes. So Peter, a couple of things. One is we've always tried to emphasize the important thing is to grow the category and to grow customers. And then ultimately, the average revenue per filer or customer will come as a result of mix and taxes becoming more complicated. So in pricing, we've always been as competitive on the low end as free. And on the high-end, we take price for value because often we're competing with a higher priced alternative like a tax store. So we like our pricing strategy this year. And we think that continuing to apply that methodology going forward is a good way to continue to grow the franchise. So yes, the answer to your question is, staying focused on growing share, growing customers and expanding the category remains our top priority and we'll continue to make the right pricing decisions on the low-end and the high-end to continue to grow revenue. Peter Goldmacher : And then, any application of your learnings to Small Business? Brad Smith : Absolutely. This year, I think our marketing team in TurboTax were able to illustrate wonderful advances in how to take a spend and actually be a little more efficient in the spend. In this case, down 10%. But actually increase traffic and conversion to the product. So there's a lot of lessons there that the rest of the company is learning from. Another thing that TurboTax did this year is they revamped their customer support model using Live Community, as well as online help. And we reduced the number of customer contacts by about 24%. And we were able to take that investment and put it back into advancing the product. So there's a lot of good lessons from TurboTax that we've already shared across the company for Small Business and the other parts of the company as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citigroup. Walter Pritchard : Brad, I wondered if you'd talk a bit about the units on the traditional QuickBooks side. We understand what's going on here in terms of the online units accelerating into the mid-to high-30s here. And you saw the QuickBooks units go lower than you've seen in the past. So I'm just wondering, help us on our expectations for sort of how much those could diverge? And do we expect to see the QuickBooks traditional units go even more negative here than they are right now, as you accelerate the transition online? Brad Smith : Yes, Walter, thanks for the question. What I am excited about is that we are getting faster acceleration to the cloud than we originally had forecasted ourselves. And it's not happening to us. The team has continued to get smarter, run experiments, and we're finding things that are helping us incentivize customers to move off the desktop into the cloud, where we know it's a better experienced for them and, quite frankly, a better lifetime value for us. So what I would say and what we communicated a few minutes ago is this decline of about 12% unit growth in QuickBooks desktop, we don't see slowing down. And if we actually are successful, we see that accelerating as we head into fiscal year '15. Our ultimate goal is to win every Small Business customer and to win every cloud decision. And that cloud decision may be an existing desktop customer, either ours or a competitor's, or it may be someone coming into the market for the first time. But we want to continue to accelerate to the cloud. And the thing we want to make sure we're doing is making it a very clear value proposition, that, that's a better solution for them. And so we expect QuickBooks desktop units to continue to decline and we expect to continue to push the accelerator in QuickBooks Online. Walter Pritchard : And then can you just -- I think you've had this challenge with some of your add-on products, payroll and payments, that you haven't have those in the channel with the online customer the way you have with your desktop customer. And I know you have plans to move those there. Have you at all accelerated those plans to move some of those offerings into the online channel, given the acceleration you're seeing and uptake of the online offering overall? Brad Smith : We have. In fact, we've been seeing very strong results when we introduced the new version of QuickBooks Online in the U.S. In this past quarter, for example, payments is up 32%. So the penetration rate of payments into new QuickBooks Online customers is actually ramping up very quickly. And we're seeing very strong results in payroll as well. So the attach rates to the new version of QuickBooks Online are actually higher than they were on the old QuickBooks Online. And we're quickly moving up the, basically, the adoption rate towards where we were with desktop. We still have a lot of runway ahead of us to get all the way to the point of desktop, but we're seeing it a much easier experience, to sell additional services within the new QuickBooks Online. Operator : And our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Brent Thill : Brad, you mentioned the realigned pricing. And when you go to QuickBooks Online on your website, you're offering 40% to 60% discounts. And I realize you run promotions at a lot of different points in the company's life cycle, but can you just talk about some of those discounts to push people online? Are you willing to continue to use price to get people to move over? And I guess, just a follow-up for Neil, when you think about this realignment to the cloud, your aspiration has always been to me, a 10% growth. But there was clearly a shortfall relative to the reported number on the Small Business side that I think we all were looking for. Is this expected to last a couple of years? Is this another year? How long do you think this will last in terms of this transition? And I guess, why not accelerate and just pull everything out of the channel? Brad Smith : All right. So Brent, we'll double-team on that. I'll start with the first piece which you directed to me. Realigned pricing was referring to, not only the decision in payments, where we got rid of a lot of the convoluted if,then statements in our pricing model and got it to a very simple 2-tiered scenario, where you can have a monthly fee and lower transaction fees or you can literally have no monthly fee and then simply pay as you go on a per transaction basis. That's driving accelerated adoption of new payments customers. And we think that's going to pay big dividends, not only in the customer experience, but in the charge volume as we look ahead. To go to the promotions on QuickBooks Online, as you know, today, if you look at the price of QuickBooks Online, it's about $26 a month. And that compares to a desktop customer who is at about $200 any time they purchase it, and they upgrade every 2.5 years. So we have room to discount and incentivize people to come in and use QuickBooks Online because we know it's very sticky. Once you come in, you start using the accounting app and you've keyed all your information in, you're going to stay. And so we think and actually believe that using promotion to incent trial and then, ultimately, that leads to a higher lifetime value. It's a very good way to grow the franchise, even if it takes a short-term hit in the revenue in the current period, it has proven to build 140 index to the prior lifetime value we were getting off of the other model. So it's a good way for us to grow the franchise long term. I'll shift it over to Neil to answer your question about how long will this transition last and what is our thinking around it. R. Williams: Yes, Brad. And Brent, thanks for the question. We still think, longer term, our financial principles are the same to provide organic revenue growth in the double-digit category. What you see in Small Business though and even in tax, to a certain extent, are some pretty significant transformations in the business model, in the way we deliver service and in the way customers pay. And we know, we're convinced, and I know you are -- you agree with us, too, that this is the right thing for the customer long term. It's a much better customer experience and the product works a lot harder. Our goal remains to add customers and to really get deeper penetration into the people who don't use software today. So QuickBooks Online has proven to be a great tool to do that. And we're not going to let the business model itself stand in the way or any short-term goals, as long as we can really show that tight improvement in customers that you're seeing in Q3 and for the year overall in our online ecosystem. And we've talked about our lifetime value compares last Investor Day, you know that on the online products, it's a significant improvement over desktop. We'll be updating that for you again in August and giving you some more clear milestones or guideposts that you can track going forward. But we think this business model transition is a really good thing. And we want to do everything we can to incent customers to use our products and to use our online offerings as soon as they're ready. So I wouldn't be caught up in any short-term concerns about guidance. But as long as the long-term story is tight, and you can understand it and see when the turn comes. Operator : Our next question comes from Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities. Gil Luria : On tax, you talked a lot about why you gained share this year. But I wanted to see what your perspective is after having completed the tax season, about why the category reaccelerated. It's been decelerating over the last few years, the growth of the digital category. And this year, it seems to have reaccelerated. What do you ascribe that to? Brad Smith : Yes, Gil. I'll share a hypothesis that we have and, of course, it's going to depend about how more data comes out from all the players in the market. But when you are a category leader, and now we have about a 63% share with the 2 points we picked up this year, it's our responsibility to champion the category and convince people who may not be using software that it's a good alternative. And this year, I believe, our marketing did a great job of doing that. The campaign, \"It's amazing what you're capable of\", resonated with consumers, have received a lot of recognition from the industry pundits and the people look at advertising. And collectively, I think, that continue to build upon what is already a secular shift, where digital has been growing in that 5% range. And I think just our ability to get that message clear to people who maybe didn't consider software in the past helped accelerate it a little bit more. So that's our responsibility. And I think that this year, our team and our marketing efforts were a little bit clearer in why people should try software, and we're going to continue to do that next year as we push further to try to expand the category. Gil Luria : Makes sense. And then, international QuickBooks Online, you're -- at this point, you're going on offense. At the rate you're expanding, would you ascribe that to accounting -- to accountant incentives? Or what -- how did you keep accelerating the growth of QuickBooks Online international? Brad Smith : Yes, Gil. I'm glad you called it out. I mean, 130% growth this quarter on top of 90% growth last quarter, I mean, really strong progress. The first thing we did, we step back and we say, \"We can't treat it as a group of countries. We have to understand how to win in every country. And to do that, we've been closing gaps in the feature functionality or local compliance on a country-by-country basis, either through third-party partners that work with our platforms or small little acquisitions. And the second is exactly where you went. We have really been working hard with the accountant channel who's the primary source of referrals and recommendations. And we've seen that flywheel continue to accelerate week over week as they get really comfortable with the new version of QuickBooks Online and they're encouraging all their clients to use it. And it's a combination of those 2 things, a country-by-country game plan to localize the product, in addition to working with the channel, with the accountants, has really continued to push that momentum forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Dunham from Goldman Sachs. Gregory Dunham : I wanted to follow up on Brent and Walter's question because I do agree, I mean, accelerating the transition timeline is going to be better for the business and the customers, long run. I guess, the question is, is there any way you can help quantify what that transition, that impact is on the growth rate in a given quarter? Or -- and help frame kind of here's where we are now, here's where we expect to be next year and 2 years down the road. I know you did that at the Analyst Day, but any update on that would be helpful. And then, a second question on payments. You provided some context in terms of what's causing that to flow currently. When do you think you're going to get to a more normalized growth rate on payments? Brad Smith : Okay. R. Williams: Hey, Greg, this is Neil. And I guess, I would tell you, for this year, for FY '14, we think the impact, just as a business model shift from desktop to QBO, is about a point of revenue growth on SBG. And we'll do -- we'll go in more depth on that in August around Investor Day when we give guidance for next year because, clearly, we see the pace accelerating. And that's going to make the -- it could make the impact more significant. But we'll break that out for you and show you how we think about it. But we think it's about a point on FY '14. The other big thing that's impacting our small business revenue overall is payments, as you brought out. And the team there is in the midst of a really big transition to -- from a platform system that enables a much simplified pricing, which is the #1 detractor we've heard from customers and it's addressing that already for customers who have moved to the simplified pricing platform. And also moving out some non-core payments businesses that really were not connected to our QuickBooks ecosystem and, frankly, weren't good prospects to connect down the road. So those 2 things, if you strip those away, payments would have an okay year this year. Payments customers and charge volume would be up about 7% in Q4 if you normalize the non-strategic things out. And so -- and those are decent numbers. They're not nearly what we think the potential is of the segment long term, but we've got great people working on this now and they've got some great plans and ideas with the attach rates to QBO going forward and the pricing structures and all that. So we'll give you more clarity as we start talking about guidance for FY '15. But we think the outcome with the QuickBooks ecosystem is very consistent with the principles we've talked about in this business for a long time. And we think the potential is really, really strong. But we'll break that out for you. We think that impact this year is about a point. It will be more next year, possibly, if we see the acceleration of QBO continue as it is now. But we'll give you some detail behind that so you can understand it and get your head around it in August. Operator : Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe from Morgan Stanley. Jennifer Swanson : I wanted to go back to the tax season a little bit and maybe follow up on Gil's question because on one hand, it seemed like a lot of the promotional activity was really focused on potentially free customers. On the other hand, I know at Analyst Day, there was a lot of discussion around some of the services that you are offering in terms of giving people potentially a little more handholding through the process as a way to compete more effectively with Paid Preparer. So just curious if you had a feel for, as you look at where new customers came into the funnel from, did you get a good sense of whether you were competing more effectively with professional or whether that was a higher convert from manual? Any color there would be helpful. Brad Smith : Yes, Jennifer, we'll go deeper as we start to unpack the season at the Analyst Day. But I will give you the hot-off-the-press stuff as we're sitting here. First of all, the promotional offer was very limited. It was a surgical strike. It was around the first peak in season and it was really by design. And we tried to foreshadow that when we talked to the market. And it was, in essence, targeted to very simple returns. People who file a very simple return that we believe overpay to get that tax return done. And so, what we did is we improved the product this year. We had a better offering and for what we call the value tier. We included prior year imports. We included W-2 download. We stripped out a bunch of unnecessary questions. You can get your taxes done very quickly. We made the refund very transparent for you. And we brought the state pricing more in line with where we saw a good competitive price value should be. And in doing that, we've always had a disproportionately low share in that segment. This year, we think we took back a good portion of the share that we believe we should have. At the same time, we were able to take forms out of our mid-tier product and move it up into the higher tier so that we had a right-for-me product and price for other customers, and we saw good movement in mix there as well. So what I would say is our focus as we come out of this season is we focused on the simple returns, and we think we had a good product and we think we had a good cross value relationship and that helped us grow share. At the same time, we were able to get our other product improved and we moved forms in between the different SKUs, and we saw a good mix shift that helped us with the higher end. And as we look ahead to next year, I think you're going to see us continue to push the envelope further towards our vision of taxes being done, eliminating the cognitive burden, reducing the number of questions you have to answer, getting as much information into the product as we can and, basically, making that the point of differentiation. I would summarize by saying this, we've always had free in this industry. Free has existed since the early 2000s, and we introduced a free commercial product 2004. This year, we had a free product just like our competitors. We have one competitor who was actually was with us step by step on pricing for everything else. The difference is we took share and that competitor lost share. And the difference wasn't price, the difference was product. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Macquarie. Brad Zelnick : Brad, as you reflect on this year's tax season and you think about it on the product level, 2 particular favorites of mine, I was hoping maybe you can give us more insight into how they performed. One, on the mobile side of things; and two, CPA Select, which sounds like a real promising strategy. How did they do? Brad Smith : Yes, thanks, Brad. First, on the mobile side, we continue to push the envelope with our original mobile offering, which was SnapTax. This year, we continued to simplify the products. We introduced a Spanish, as well as an English version. And we saw continued high user ratings and downloads of that app. But we also had some new learnings, which is not unique to other industries but, for our industry, we were able to capitalize on it. And that is, if you move out of app stores, a lot of people still want to use their phones and tablets to interact, even if they haven't downloaded an app. And so, this year, when we changed the product in TurboTax, we made it a responsive design, which means you could go into TurboTax online on your tablet or your phone and it would adjust to the screen size and basically present the questions in a way that was easy to interact. We saw a 40% lift in people who are doing at least one log-in through a phone or a tablet to get their taxes done this year. That was a significant improvement and it gives us a lot of encouragement in the direction we're heading for next year. So around mobile, good improvements around SnapTax, but big learnings around how to use responsive design and actually increase the number of people using the mobile device to do some portion of their taxes. If you get a CPA Select, for those who may not know the context here, this is the ability for us to take a big portion of people who may come into TurboTax.com and, for some reason, lose confidence and feel like they wish they had someone who could assist them with the process. What we're doing is we're connecting all that traffic from TurboTax.com to some of the CPAs that buy our tax software, whether it's Lacerte or Pro series. This year, we were in beta. We had 500 CPAs who signed up. Those 500 CPAs processed 4x the number of returns than we did last year. And the Net Promoter Score for the CPA Select was a 79. And so, it continues to eclipse -- an average CPA has a Net Promoter of a 51. This is 28 points higher. So we're very encouraged by CPA Select. And I think you'll see us continue to lean into that as we go into next tax season. Brad Zelnick : Very helpful insight. And if I could just follow up, Brad, on the Small Business side. QuickBooks Online, momentum seems to be fantastic and I just wanted to ask specifically about your partnerships with Square and Amex? And am I stretching to think that in any way those partnerships might be helping online adoption? Brad Smith : Yes, Brad. First of all, we are very excited about those partnerships. We also have others that are in the works. They're still early days. I certainly believe they add value to the platform. They're encouraged with the early results, as are we. And so, I would say, yes, they are helping. I don't know if it's stretching or not to say they're the reason why we're accelerating because, clearly, we're going after a platform approach and they're still pretty early days in terms of volume. But I do think it illustrates the point, this is not your granddaddy's QuickBooks Online. This is a new platform with open APIs that serious players, like Amex and Square, see value in. And there's a real compelling reason for small businesses to try it as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Neil, I'll start with you, and then with you, Brad, a follow-up. On the tax category, could you discuss a little bit about the timing and magnitude of marketing spend for Consumer Tax as you move through the season? R. Williams: Yes, Scott. As Brad mentioned earlier, it's down about 10% overall. As you probably noticed, the spend was targeted around certain relatively large events, and it was not an intensity on a daily basis as we've had it in the past. It was very targeted to areas where we know a lot of the target audience is going to be tuned in, are going to be watching, are going to be accessible. And as Brad mentioned, we monitor traffic very carefully. Our traffic improved nicely over this past season. We still have almost 60% of the people who actually file returns come to our website sometimes during the tax season, unique visitors. But the spend this season was much more targeted. It was targeted throughout, but it was focused in certain high points when we know there's going to be a lot of volume and to certain high-impact venues where we know we're going to see a lot of people, as opposed to being universally carpet bombed throughout the season. Scott Schneeberger : And then, Brad, convergence seems to be a theme. It's kind of a holy grail you had sought for the last few years, seeing a lot of people coming to the website and feeling that you get them but you just hadn't converted them. It seems like you had great retention, a lot of great new acquisitions. Could you just speak a little bit to what was occurring there? Was it showing some of the pricings you gave in the state? Obviously, as mentioned, the improved website and especially the core categories in the early season? Is there enough of a momentum that you've built up this year that you can go a lot more of those folks next year without pushing too much on price again? Brad Smith : Yes, Scott. I would tell you that the conversion piece was more attributable to an improved product experience and really driven by our data scientists and our data analytics team. As you know, we made an acquisition of Level Up. That team put a lot of their energy and focus with the rest of our data sciences on tax this year. They saw points in the experience that were causing friction, where people were stopping and delaying for multiple seconds, where they saw where there was dropoff occurring. They rolled up their sleeves with our engineers. We went in, we tuned the product and we got the funnel so tuned that we continue to see improved conversion everyday as we went towards April 15. In fact, I'll tell you, there was one portion, which is basically our non-campaign traffic that came to our homepage, so not anything driven by a TV ad, but non-campaign traffic. It improved -- conversion improved 700 basis points in that one area. And as you know, 0.5 point or 1 point of conversion is significant. So I would say that the pricing piece was a reason to get people to say, come in and give this a shot. But it was really the product experience that drove the increased conversion and the retention. And quite frankly, it was because we continue to look at data and analytics as a way to improve the experience. Scott Schneeberger : I have 2 more separate ones. I'll say them at the same time, just to sneak them in. First one, in years' past, you used hundreds of tax professionals to help. It sounds like you really reduced dependence on that and it was excessive. If you could you address of that a little bit more. And then also, your thoughts going forward with regard to the ACA next year and how that will affect the pricing in the industry, yourself included? Brad Smith : Okay. So first of all, on tax pros. Historically, what we've tried to do is we want to make sure that if a customer has a question, that we can answer it in a way that gives them confidence to go ahead and complete their return. And we've experimented with a lot of things and we're going to continue to be able to give you access to an expert. That's what CPA Select is designed to do. But as we dug deeper and learned some of the lessons and, quite frankly, some of the mistakes that we made in the past, one of the things we realized is customers really don't want have a question in the first place. So this year, by simplifying the product, stripping out questions that have absolutely nothing to do with your tax experience, we were able to reduce the number of questions or customers calling in by 24%. That's a big number, 1 out of 4 questions basically erased because the product is simpler. The second thing the team did is they redesigned help and think of it like Amazon's mayday button. Instead of having 6 or 7 different places to go get help, there was one universal place. And when you logged in, you could either get your answer through Live Community from some other user, you could get it from one of the experts who moderates that forum, or you could get it in product or you could click a button and call one of our agents. And because that was all in one place, we saw a lot of people getting the answer without needing to make a phone call to an expert or even to one of our call centers. And so, just a better help experience, being inspired by other great companies like Amazon, helped us reimagine that. We will continue to have access to experts. It won't be as human-intensive as it was a couple of years ago because some of the insights I just shared. But I do think you'll see us with CPA Select continue to say, \"Look, if you do want to have a pro look at it, then we'll get you to a pro who can help you through that experience.\" I'll shift now to ACA. The big piece here for us is we've been pretty clear all along that this is an important thing to make sure we can help customers understand, then understand the implications for them. Do they qualify for a subsidy or do they owe a penalty? And then from there, to be able to take action on that insight, either help them file their tax return or connect them to our partner to help them buy insurance. This year, we had about 900,000 visitors to TurboTax help. We had a very high Net Promoter Score on that experience, but we still fundamentally believe, based upon the experience that we've seen through our own customers, as well as what happened in Massachusetts years ago when this was implemented, that this will not drive behavior shifts from one tax prep method to another, if the tax prep company is doing their job. And our job is to demystify affordable care, to answer your questions, to help you take action on that insight and basically help you through the process. And we are fully prepared and we're continuing to ramp up, so we'll be ready again next season. Operator : Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. David Togut : Brad, could you update us on the timing of your launch for QBO online for manufacturers, the new version that will have inventory capability? Brad Smith : Yes, thanks, David. Today, we have partners that you can link to, including the one that we just made an official member of the family. We just made the acquisition of Lettuce. The Lettuce's inventory capability has worked with QuickBooks Online through APIs. And so, today, a manufacturer can use QuickBooks Online and then sign up for a third-party app and be able to solve those problems. Of course, we just announced the acquisition. Our goal was between now and, over the next 4 to 5 months, we'll get that fully integrated in, so that's an even more seamless experience. And then hopefully, you'll see that come out as just a part of core piece of QuickBooks Online. But today, you can get that problem solved through a third-party app. But as we integrate Lettuce into our QBO product platform, you'll see that become more seamless over the next 4 to 5 months. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Willi from Wells Fargo. Timothy Willi : I wanted to ask a question about payment, and then a follow-up on payroll, if I could. So just going to payments and the integration you talk about with QuickBooks. Obviously, this, I guess, integrated sales approach has gotten a lot more attention as of late with Vantiv buying Mercury and just general secular opportunity there. Could you talk about your integration, not only with QuickBooks, but how you think about payments with the actual hardware and developer community outside of Intuit? And then, to what degree investments around vertical specific strategies or customer service might still yet to be quantified, if in fact that's something you think you may have to do? Brad Smith : Okay, Tim, we'll take a stab at this. And let me know if there's any particular areas you want to drill deeper on. So I'll start with payments, and you said you'd get the payroll in a minute. So the first thing that we recognized is it's not sufficient to cross-sell a product to a customer in accounting and think you're going to get a lot of adoption. It actually has to be at that moment of truth, when they're accepting a payment and they're logging it into QuickBooks, you want to make it frictionless for them just to accept that payment electronically. And so, we have done a really serious job again with our data scientists to say where are those moments of truth when you're in the workflow where it's natural to have an ability to go ahead and accept the payment. And that deeper integration is helping us draw the attach rate up to the new QuickBooks Online. The second thing we've done is because we know something about you already as a customer, instead of taking you through a credit app and then screening you to say, \"Are we going to give you access to credit or not,\" we're prequalifying you in the background. So there's no friction now where we have to stop you and then do a check on you to say, \"Hey, are we going to let you sign up for credit or not.\" So that's reduced a lot of the friction in the activation and the basic sign-up process. The second thing we mentioned a little earlier is we've reduced the friction of price. We now know that it's important to give customers just a limited set of options. One is, don't pay anything, just on a per transaction basis. The other is if you think if you're a high-volume processor, pay a low monthly fee and then pay a lower transaction, and either one of those give you a good price value relationship. The third piece is the piece that you were asking about with partners. One of the very strategic decisions we made with the new QuickBooks Online is to be an open platform. Our primary focus strategically is on service-based businesses. Businesses that generate invoices and then wait 48 days on average to get paid. And what we're doing is putting our payments capability into QuickBooks to basically make this an electronic invoice and an electronic payment in a matter of days and get the cash flow much stronger for small businesses. Now there are a lot of other payments companies that are focused on retailers and restaurants where there's a physical point-of-sale presence. And while we have one of our own products there, we've also opened up our API to Square, to American Express and to others to say, \"Look, if they have really good, compelling products and hardware, we want that to work with QuickBooks as well.\" And so, we have opened up our platform to complement our own strategy so that small businesses can accept payments any way they want and we can sign the right commercial agreement to make that friction go away for the Small Business, and to help us grow our franchise as well. So I know there's a lot in there. But hopefully, I touched on the 3 or 4 major buckets you were looking for in payments. Did I miss anything? Timothy Willi : No, that's a good starting point. I'll follow up with Matt. Brad Smith : Okay. Timothy Willi : Afterwards, go into a bit more detail. And then just on payroll, I apologize if this was asked. But just thoughts around sort of the cloud payroll environment. We've obviously have some visible IPOs around cloud-based companies. And just your thoughts around sort of what those companies are targeting in the payroll, in HR space versus how you think about your offerings in your install base or new customer acquisition, if you will? Brad Smith : Yes, I sure can. Payroll continues to be a very exciting space, especially as you transition to the cloud. Having been in the industry for half a dozen years before I came to this company 11 years ago, one reality about payroll in the small business space is the average number of people who switch to payroll decision is mid single digits every year. And so, the real key is, are you there at that moment where they're either had an issue, they've had a tracer or an inquiry from the IRS where they've hired their first employee? Can you actually capitalize on that moment? And that's where having QuickBooks as our distribution channel gives us a very strong competitive advantage because we can see when they add an employee in QuickBooks. And then, as a result, we can sign them up with an in-product message and our cost of acquisition is almost 0. But most importantly, we're there at that moment of truth to give them a solution immediately so that they can cut a check. Our online version of payroll this quarter grew 23%. It continues to accelerate, and we continue to see strong growth quarter-over-quarter. And that, in conjunction with the ecosystem of QuickBooks, we think gives us a durable competitive advantage because it's not a standalone decision, it's already in the customer's office, and we can see when they add an employee. And we don't have to send a salesperson, we don't have to do an online ad, we don't have to do a banner ad. We literally just enable the payroll right there and get the customer up and running. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Millman from Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman : You talked a little bit about Lettuce. I was wondering if, on this bunch of acquisitions you have made, if there's any you might consider that will become potential blockbusters as you combine them? And secondly, you talked at least about one of the acquisitions helping the tax. Have there been other acquisitions, either standalone or acquisition-related, to the business and that have also helped tax business. Brad Smith : Yes. Thank you, Michael. A couple things here. First of all, we're really excited about each of these half-dozen that we mentioned. As you've seen, our pattern tends to be to look for talent and technology that either helps us round out a feature set, like Lettuce does with inventory for QuickBooks, or helps us accelerate our strategic direction around things like data sciences with Level Up. And the acquisition you are referring to here around tax was basically a product that enables us to pull in PDFs and then electronically translate that into something we can import into a tax return so the consumer doesn't have to key in the information themselves. That's all a part of our vision of moving from never enter data twice to never enter data at all, where what we call in tax, taxes are done. Basically, reducing the frictions required to key information in. Is there a blockbuster here? Boy, I hope so. Good news is we're excited about all of them, but we've got to demonstrate this is gonna to change the trajectory of the company. But I have to say, I really love the fact that we've got a lot of momentum and a strong pipeline. And these aren't best-of-farm kinds of acquisition in terms of their size, but they're adding extremely important capability around technology and talent that we're already starting to see an impact on the business overall. Operator : And our final question comes from James Bark [ph] from Senator Investment Group. Unknown Analyst : In terms of competitive landscape, to what extent are you seeing 0 gain share overall in the U.S.? And then, Sage in Europe, to what extent do you feel like you're competing effectively against Sage? They seem you've had an extremely difficult time making the transition to the cloud, and I'm wondering if they're even much of a relevant competitive stretch to you outside of maybe the U.K.. Brad Smith : Yes, James. It's good to have you on the call. And I'll start with competition overall. I think it's a good matter of practice to respect your competition, to understand what they're doing and to be very clear about how your different and how you plan to win. And so, just to put that out there, we have a respect for all of our competitors. At the same time, we have a lot of confidence that if we play our A game, we continue to be the market leader, and we plan to do that. In the case of Xero, it's kind of hard to know how many customers they have right now. They're reporting their numbers. And so, I will let them do that. We see tens of thousands of customers in the U.S. right now, and it's early days for them by their own admission. Just to put that into context, we added 63,000 net customers in this past quarter alone. And so, the size of our business in the U.S. compared to theirs or the fact that we're accelerating globally from 90% growth last quarter to 130%, gives us confidence that if we continue to get the product right for the local markets and we continue to leverage our relationship with accountants, that we've got game. And we're very excited about that. Competition makes everybody better. In the case of Sage, I think what you're talking about is an incumbent who's happened to make the move to the cloud. The good news for us is we began that journey in the late '90s. We've had an online version of TurboTax, of QuickBooks, our payroll businesses and so, we've continued to re-factor our technology and add smart acquisitions along the way. And I think that we're up on our toes. I think Sage clearly has a new version of online. The question will be whether or not they can move fast enough, with the new players coming into the market, to compete. But again, I respect them, and I wish them well. But our goal is to put a few more points on the board than they do. Unknown Analyst : And then just lastly, with regard to Sage. I know they've had very little success in the cloud outside of U.K. But to what extent are you feel like you're gaining share with them, against them in Europe or in U.K., in both the SMB market, and then in the accounting-focused market. Brad Smith : Yes. I would tell you that we're focused primarily in the U.K. and Europe, as you know, and you just pointed out. Our acceleration of new customer acquisition and our sign-up of accountants in the U.K. is exceeding the forecast that we had put in place back in August. We updated the 4k path [ph] again in January, and it's ahead of that again. So our momentum is building in the U.K. In terms of whether that's coming at the expense of Sage or it's new users, I don't have that level of information. We can talk more about that when we get to Analyst Day. But I can tell you that right now, our momentum in the U.K. is extremely encouraging and, clearly, as the incumbent there, the real question is going to be, are they going to be able to keep pace? And that's going to be up to them to answer. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions at this time. Gentlemen, would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith : Yes, Sa-il. Just a couple of questions. I want to thank everybody for the questions. We are pleased with the result this quarter. We're laser-focused on the opportunity ahead. I can tell you the energy level in the company is high. We love this momentum to the cloud. We fully appreciate that there's a current period trade-off as we move from a one-time purchase to a 12-month subscription. But we love the long-term prospects and the fact that the lifetime value is higher. We're going to continue to press forward to win this game in the cloud and we're looking forward to speaking to you again in the next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the call. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

My name is Saheed (Ph), and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Fourth Quarter Full Year Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) With that, now, I will turn the call over to Matt Rhodes, Intuit\u2019s Director of Investor relations. Mr. Rhodes, you may begin. Matt Rhodes : Thank you, sir. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Intuit\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2014 conference call. I\u2019m here with Brad Smith, our President and CEO; Neil Williams, our CFO; and Scott Cook, our founder. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon our Form 10-K for fiscal 2013 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. Our fact sheet and press release include new disclosures and other materials to help you understand and model the financial impact of the strategic decisions that we\u2019ll discuss today. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brad Smith. Brad Smith : All right. Thank you Matt and thanks to all of you for joining us. I\u2019ve been looking forward to today\u2019s earnings call for two reasons. First because we have some positive results to discuss. And second because we want to share some exciting strategic decision that positions us for accelerated performance as we look ahead. Let me begin with the positive result. We closed down our fiscal year 2014 on a strong note with excellent momentum in each of our businesses. For the full fiscal year total revenue grew 8% and earnings per share increased 9%.  The strong results we\u2019re in the context of an acceleration file base subscription the shifted revenue in the future reporting period. The results also reflect the significant restructuring effort that we executed in our fiscal fourth quarter to reallocate resources to our online services and to drive a separate improvement in our product and customer growth. Adjusting for the impact of the related restructuring charges our revenue, our operating income and our earnings per share would have at the high end of our guidance range.  Stepping beyond the current period result and even more excited about the choices that we\u2019re making for the future. To sum it up, we\u2019re fully committed the wining in the cloud. Over three decades we\u2019ve navigated several platform shifts from Dos to Windows to the web and in every instance we see the opportunity to reimagine our offerings and extend our market leadership position and we\u2019re doing it again. We\u2019ve been delivering cloud based services for over a decade with more than 30 million Intuit customers using offerings across a variety of desktop and mobile devices. The benefits are clear, online experiences are simply better for customer. They expand our total addressable market and they generate more predictable recurring revenue strength.  Today we\u2019ll discuss several decisions to further accelerate our shift the cloud based services which will include changes that we\u2019re making to our desktop product that will lead us to recognize desktop revenue overtime. The combination of these choices will create a transition year for fiscal 2015 financial reporting as we will explain this is a short term impact and we fully expect our fiscal 2015 results to return to double digit top and bottom line growth and alignment with financial principals. Our outlook for fiscal 2017 is a company approaching $6 billion and predictable recurring revenue and generating roughly $5 in non-GAAP earnings per share. Now with that context let me flip down and share my reflections on the company\u2019s current period performance as well as the strategic choices that we\u2019re making starting with our small business group. I\u2019m quite encouraged by the increasing momentum and our QuickBooks Online ecosystem. This past quarter we reached a strategic inflection point with more new to the franchise customers choosing QuickBooks Online over QuickBooks Desktop for the first time ever. The achievement in this milestone was driven by two factors.  First, the circular shift with the cloud is now in full swing for small businesses just as it was several years ago for our consumer businesses. This tailwind is in the early stages of development and it will continue for many years. And second, we\u2019ve been accelerating this small business adoption at file services. Our catalyst is the success of our QuickBooks Online offering as an open platform  This enables Intuit and third-party products to work together seamlessly in the cloud. The new QuickBooks Online is one of the biggest breakthrough products we have launched and it is leaving us with filling. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 40%, up from 36% in the previous quarter. We added approximately 60,000 net customers in a seasonally slower quarter. We closed fiscal 2014 with nearly 700,000 QuickBooks Online customers and more than 1 million total QuickBooks subscribers. The new Online experience enables the seamless purchase of additional services as evidenced by our payroll attach rate improving to 19% in the fourth quarter, up from 16% a year ago. The attach rate for active payments customers is currently 5% also up from 3% in the prior year. These improved attach rates are contributing to an increase in the annualized recurring revenue for subscriber. And finally the new QuickBooks Online is a global platform which has significantly increased our total addressable market. Outside the U.S., QuickBooks Online subscribers were up more than 150% in the fourth quarter, further accelerating from the 130% growth last quarter.  Now shifting to our consumer tax business, the team delivered an exceptional year. As the category champion, we helped drive digital category growth of more than 6% compared with assisted tax spread method such as tax stores declining 1%. The secular shift to do-it-yourself software is the continuation of a decade long transition to digital solution and our efforts simply added fuel to the trend. Within the software category TurboTax gained over 2 point of share, growing TurboTax online units 14% and total TurboTax unit 10%. Our investment in product improvement paid off with Web site traffic, conversion, retention and overall net promoter scores improved in every single dimension. Hitting the total key, consumer tax revenue grew 7% for the fiscal year better than our original guidance of 4% to 5%. But as we shared this was just a first year of a multiyear journey towards our ultimate product vision and the team has some exciting things in the pipeline as we look forward to the next half season.  We also had strong results in our Pro-tax and consumer ecosystem businesses, both businesses exceeded their internal plan, their external guidance, they have a strong pipeline of innovative offering in the work and they are definitely looking forward to another strong year in fiscal year \u201815. When you sum up the results across the company, customer growth and more specifically subscriber growth is accelerated. Active use is improving, attach rates are increasing and global adoption has hit a stride which takes me to my second reason, we are looking forward to today\u2019s call. The explanation of several strategic choices that we have made that will enable us to further accelerate the growth of our online ecosystem. First, as I mentioned earlier, we restructured our small business organization in the fourth quarter to increase the focus and investment on the QuickBooks Online ecosystem. The actions that we have taken improve our speed of decision making, prioritize key functionality and compliant services that are necessary to win in each of the global geographies and they include some soon to be announced initiatives that will make it even more attractive for accountants and their clients to sign up for QuickBooks Online. We have increased our investment in R&D, sales and marketing and infrastructure to capitalize on a huge addressable market with our global-ready QuickBooks Online offering. Our demonstrated success in fiscal 2014 convinced us that now is the time to make this investment. Second, in support of our goal to win every cloud decision, we are making important product changes to continue to delight our QuickBooks Desktop customers, many of them will be cloud customers in the future. As you know roughly 4 million small businesses use QuickBooks Desktop. Our goal is to attract them with compelling online experiences and incentives to move to the cloud. To that end, we are strengthening our desktop products beginning in 2015 by delivering ongoing experience releases. These will continuously improve the product experience, support operating system update and provide access to connected services. These actions are designed to ensure that our desktop customers and/or accountants remain our most vocal advocates today and become our cloud customers of tomorrow. As a result of these changes to our desktop product, we will begin recognizing desktop revenue over time as opposed to upfront at the time of purchase. This change will apply to our future QuickBooks, Pro-tax and Quicken desktop products. This is a strategic decision in favor of the customer that will push about $400 million of revenue from our fiscal 2015 into deferred revenue that will be recognized in future period. We will provide all the relevant disclosures for you to see and model the financial impact. For our small business group, the combination of these decisions, positions us to more rapidly penetrate an enormous Global market with a proven Online ecosystem powered by the new QuickBooks Online and as I said the time to make these changes is now because the fruit point are clear. More specifically QuickBooks Online is opening new stores with 75% of the new QuickBooks Online customers being first-time customers to the Intuit franchise. The QuickBooks Online platform is increasing our ability to generate higher annualized recurring revenue through selling additional services seamlessly. To put the improved payroll and payments attach results in the perspective the annualized recurring revenue for a small business online ecosystem was up 34% this quarter. Adding the global opportunity and our total addressable market expansion 29 million small businesses in the U.S. and over 100 million worldwide it\u2019s the only focus on the currently prioritized markets of Canada, the UK, Australia and India. The number of our weekly rose new subscribers that we\u2019re adding in non U.S. market is currently averaging 2000 per week this is up from 600 per week just one year ago. And finally for the existing QuickBooks Desktop customers and their accountant, we have the best online solution and we will be introducing new initiatives to further set them to move to the cloud. As a result we do anticipate the number of desktop migrators will continue increase meaningfully in the coming year. On that note I\u2019m going to turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details and our guidance. R. Neil Williams :  Thanks Brad. Let\u2019s start with overall company results. For fiscal 2014, we delivered revenue of $4.5 billion up 8%, non-GAAP operating income of $1.6 billion up 6%, GAAP operating income of $1.3 billion up 5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.49 up 9% and GAAP earnings per share of $3.9 up 9%.  For the fourth quarter fiscal 2014, we delivered revenue of $714 million up 13%. Non-GAAP operating income up $2 million and GAAP operating loss of $73 million. Non-GAAP loss per share of $0.01 and GAAP loss per share of $0.14. We incurred charge of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter primarily as result of the small business restructuring effort that Brad explained earlier. This impacted our non-GAAP and GAAP operating income and earnings per share. We also sold our 11% stake in Reckon, which generated a gain of $21 million in GAAP results. We\u2019ve included a bridge in the factsheet to illustrate this impact.  Turning to the business segments, total small business revenue grew 12% for the quarter and 10% for the year. Customer acquisition in our connected services businesses continues to be our primary goal and is driving growth in the QuickBooks Online ecosystem. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 40% accelerating from the third quarter. Small business online ecosystem annualized recurring revenue grew 34% driven by retention and improved attach rates. Annualized recurring revenue is a new metric it will provide in our factsheet each quarter. We divide annualized recurring revenue as four times, the most recent quarterly revenue for our online offering serving small business customers. This includes QuickBooks Online subscriptions, online payroll, online payments, Demandforce and QuickBooks. Within this context our online active payments customers grew 4% and online payments charge volume grew 24% driven by an increase in charge volume for user. Online payroll customers grew 25%. And global adoption of QuickBooks Online continue to accelerate as we finish the year with 84,000 paying QuickBooks Online customers outside of the U.S. up from 32,000 a year ago. As the adoption of the cloud becomes more prevalent and we focus our energy and resources in this area our recurring revenue will increase and QuickBooks Desktop unit will continue to be flat. In the fourth quarter desktop units declined 10% and for the full year they declined 10%. The decline in desktop units in fiscal 2014 was more than offset by growth of subscribers as total QuickBooks customer growth accelerated to 6%.  We expect total QuickBooks customer to continue to grow next year as we emphasis the QuickBooks Online ecosystem even though desktop units and revenue will decline. We describe cloud is a better experience for customers it\u2019s also a better business model for our shareholders, this is onetime revenue QuickBooks Online customers are greater than that are desktop customers and it increases the predictability of revenues. We provided details on our factsheet to help you understand the unit economics of our online and desktop ecosystems as we stand today and we\u2019ll talk about the levels per growth as we execute against our top priority expanding the category for growing customers and share globally. There is one way to compare online and desktop using fiscal 2014 as an example. As you can see on the factsheet online ecosystem revenue was $592 million. Using ending QuickBooks Online subscribers of 683,000, we generated more than $800 in annual revenue per customer. On the desktop side, dividing $1.6 billion and fiscal 2014 revenue by $4 million customers, we generated less than $500 per customer. We have broadened our consumer tax business that we can use price and changes to our product lineup to effectively grow customers. We have also proven that we can build lifetime value through improved retention and attached services.  To drive customer growth in QuickBooks online ecosystem, we will continue to experiment with pricing, promotions and bundles that deliver value for more end-users. We will also continue to improve attach and retention to enhance lifetime value. This is our strategy to accelerate growth in customers and revenue over the next few years. Now let\u2019s look more closely at the financial impact of the strategic decision to provide ongoing support and services to our desktop customers that Brad described. This decision will affect future sales of QuickBooks and Desktop products for revenue we recognized ratably over approximately three years and our professional tax solutions where more revenue will be recognized over the entire tax year. For customers, this enables seamless product enhancements as well as better tier and online services ensuring that we keep our desktop customers happy and retain them in the Intuit franchise. They are our future online customers. For our employees, the strategic decision means clarity of work priorities, bringing up their time to build better online products and for shareholders this means more customers and faster growth longer term. Desktop revenue will now be recognized over time similar to how monthly subscription revenue is recognized. Now when we sell our desktop unit, the cash comes in, and our deferred revenue balance increases, so you will be able to easily track our progress on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. We are committed to transparency and clarity around the strategic decision that will make modeling our business easier over time as the predictability of our revenue increases. We expect these changes to lower fiscal 2015 revenues by approximately $400 million, increasing deferred revenue by the same amount. We have included a bridge in our press release and factsheet that will help you understand the impact of this change and revenue recognition and accelerated QuickBooks Online growth on our revenue guidance for fiscal 2015. So best way to gauge the success and health of our small business ecosystem going forward, will be through subscriber counts and annualized recurring revenue, will help you bridge reported results of the next few quarters to our historically reported results. Moving over to tax, consumer tax revenue grew 22% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the year. We will continue to invest in the product experience and to prioritize growth in share and customers above margin expansion. Pro-tax revenue grew 16% for the fourth quarter and 4% for the year. Our Pro-tax business also had a great season which much of our customer coming in higher value solutions. One thing that is not changed is our disciplined approach through capital management. For approximately $1.9 billion cash in our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. We also look for M&A opportunities and in fiscal 2014; we made 10 acquisitions totaling approximately $550 million. We will return cash to shareholders via share repurchases and we repurchased a $152 million of shares in the fourth quarter, about $1.9 billion remains on our current share repurchase authorization. We reduced our share count by 4% net in fiscal 2014 and we expected to be in the market consistently in fiscal 2015. Our capital plans included cash dividend of up to a $1 per share for fiscal 2015 with the first quarter dividend of $0.25 per share payable on October 20. This represents a 32% increase versus last year and reflects our confidence in our business strategy and our large and growing cash position as well as more recurring and predictable revenue streams. Now let\u2019s move onto guidance, taking into account the impact of the strategic decisions Brad described, our outlook for fiscal 2015 is revenue of $4.275 billion to $4.375 billion. Adjusted for the financial impact of the strategic decisions, fiscal 2015 revenue guidance would have been growth of 5% to 8%; GAAP operating income of $800 million to $830 million; non-GAAP operating income of $1.11 billion to $1.14 billion; GAAP diluted EPS of a $1.70 to a $1.75; non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.45 to $2.50.  Moving to our segment guidance for fiscal 2015, we expect QuickBooks Online subscribers of 925,000 to 950,000 for growth of 35% to 39%. Small business group revenue to decline 3% to 6% but adjusting for the changes we discussed revenue will grow roughly 10%. Consumer group revenue growth of 3% to 4% with Consumer Tax revenue growth of 5% to 7% and professional tax revenue decline of 34% to 37% but adjusting for the change in our product, our Pro-tax revenue grow approximately 5%. Guidance for our first quarter revenue, operating income, EPS and QuickBooks Online subscribers is available in our press release and our factsheet.   Looking beyond fiscal 2015, we provided a longer term outlook in our factsheet and press release. Beginning in fiscal 2016, we expect to grow revenues double-digits as we recognize the revenue we\u2019ve deferred this year and continue to experience strong growth in our QuickBooks Online subscriber base in ecosystem. We expect to grow revenues faster than expenses generating operating leverage. For fiscal 2017, we expect QuickBooks Online subscribers of approximately 2 million, an increase from 683,000 today providing compounded annual growth of more than 40%. Intuit revenue of roughly 5.8 billion or 9% growth on average over the next three years and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $5, reflecting low teens growth on average over the next three years. We\u2019ve shared mainly disclosures with you on our factsheet breaking our small business customer metrics and revenue disclosures clearly into online and desktop ecosystems. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith : All right Neil. You had covered a lot of stuff there buddy. Neil Williams : That\u2019s right. Brad Smith : So let me start to summarize it. We reached the inflection point and we are seizing the opportunities. Our Company is focused on two strategic outcomes we\u2019ve spoken to you about in the past; number one, to the operating system on small businesses expanse; and number two, to do the nations taxes. Our small business momentum continues to build and our QuickBooks Online ecosystem growth is accelerating, driving value for customers and for Intuit. We\u2019ve reorganized our small business group and prioritized investments that will further accelerate our online ecosystem globally while ensuring the best product experience for existing desktop customers speeding up their move to the cloud. We have a proven formula to Intuit if we innovate into live customers with the absolute best solution in the market we will expand our category, we will grow our share and we will increase lifetime value over time. So we\u2019re stepping on the gas to drive share gain and longer term growth opportunities in all of our businesses. We have lots of runway in front of us and we remain deeply committed to accelerating customer and revenue growth. And we\u2019re going to talk more about these things and our strategy to execute against them at our Investor Day, which we\u2019ll hold on our Mountain View Campus on September 30th, and we look forward to seeing you there. As always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and their ongoing focus. And with that, let\u2019s open it up to you to hear what\u2019s on your mind. Operator : Thank you (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open please go ahead. Brent Thill - UBS Investment Research : Maybe Brad for you and then one for Neil. When you look at the adjusted revenue guidance of 5% to 8%, it seems like on an apples-to-apples comparison from past years that is a little lower than where you\u2019ve initially guided. It sounds like if I am bringing this trickling that the delta in that might be your willingness to be a little more aggressive on price. I am just curious if you could address that? And maybe for Neil certain we\u2019ve all seen this will Adobe and oDesk the transition. But when you think about the very long term, and you think about the operating margin structure there is a lot of questions, is this more profitable or less profitable. I am just curious I know you\u2019re going to give anything past $5 in range but is it, from your perspective, has this opened up an opportunity to effectively become a lot more profitable longer term? Thank you. Brad Smith : Brent, thank you. This is Brad I\u2019ll take that first one. First of all as you identified the guidance next year of 5% to 8% on an adjusted basis does reflect the fact that we\u2019ve hit this inflection point and we realized the way to grow this company long term is to acquire new customers the licenses so that they stay and then earn the opportunity to sell additional services. We also recognized and in addition to focusing on customer growth which is the first of that formula that we need also have a good cross value relationship. And we\u2019ve talked about pulling back a little bit on some of the dependency we\u2019ve had on price over the years in some of our businesses and we\u2019ve been making those decisions along the way like the simplified payments price that we talked to you about this year. When you put it all together there I think it\u2019s important to look at the fiscal year \u201916 and \u201917 guidance we\u2019ve provided where we\u2019ve clearly articulated that we can see a return to double digit top line and bottom line growth. So this is a one year transition next year and it is a reflection of us being very aggressive about expanding the categories, growing customer growth and then earning the opportunity to sell additional services every time. Neil Williams : And so Brent I would just say as it relates to the margin the outlook we\u2019ve talked about for \u201916 and \u201917 clearly initiate we get back to where we were last year in terms of margin percentage. But as you know we talked about this a lot we really have operating income growth over margin expansion. If we can see more customer growth and more top line growth we will invest more and we\u2019re really focused more on the operating income growth and the dollars over the long haul than we are in the margin percentages. And so we\u2019ll see how that plays out and we\u2019ll see what\u2019s available to us and how much growth we get on the top line and that will determine how much we invest and spend. But as you seen now we\u2019re expecting to get back in this same neighborhood a little better than we are today by the out years. Brent Thill - UBS Investment Research : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. your line is open please go ahead. Walter Pritchard - Citi: Thanks. Just I guess Neil a question for you; you did very clearly outlined on the revenue side the 475 million in tax. I\u2019m wondering as we think about impact on EPS just thinking about 75 million as copying straight down in the bottom line in terms of EPS in fiscal \u201815 and then I just had one follow up as it relates to implication to that. Brad Smith :  The simple answer Walter is yes, I mean that\u2019s why we think about it 475 drops all the way through and as you know these adjusted deferral of revenue out to prior periods for most of us so there is really no impact on marketing our build expense so it\u2019s all margin compression. Walter Pritchard - Citi :  And it does looks like if I just adjust that out and it\u2019s worth about $25 in fiscal \u201815 if I add that back to your guidance you\u2019re slightly shy of where and maybe we\u2019d expect you to guide in what the sort of margin progress you can only had over the years, that\u2019s just incremental spend about beyond the transition behind kind of push online and other initiatives that have going for transition? Brad Smith :  I would say its two things Walter; first of all, it does reflect some additional investment an expansion outside of the U.S. and moving more of our engineering resources to online products and services. It also reflects that we didn\u2019t buys many shares back in 2014 as we would have liked or as we had hoped. We were out of the market for a significant period of time during the pack season and you probably notice late in the fourth quarter our trading volume was unusually low for our shares. And so our original aspiration will probably get more shares brought in this year than we were able to accomplish and that\u2019s piece of the EPS count. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch :  Hi guys. Bold transformation, congratulations on this initiative. Can you talk about the implied acceleration just like fiscal \u201815 is going to find this year but as we look at the \u201816 and \u201817 there is an implied acceleration in your top line, how comfortable are you with that and what are your assumptions behind the acceleration maybe it pick up customer growth or ARR growth or attach payroll and payments, can you just walk through the quantitative consideration and also how should we think about your margin I know that your focus is on growing operating income but as we look at your $5 in non-GAAP earnings targeting fiscal \u201817 what is the embedded operating margin assumption behind it? Thank you very much. Brad Smith : All right Kash this is Brad. Let me start with the first piece the implied acceleration. So first and forecast we\u2019re going to have a benefit from the cash that will be collecting for desktop purchases in fiscal year \u201815 that we\u2019ll show up as recognized revenue in \u201816 and \u201817 but the bigger driver is customer growth and subscriber growth and it\u2019s recurring as predictable revenue and as you can see we continue to accelerate our subscriber growth in QuickBooks Online and that is the primary driver both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. a new global markets. And the second and third big drivers here is our ability to continue to deliver more delightful experience and so our attrition is being reduced and so customers are staying and actively using the product and last but not least as evidence by the payroll and payments attach rate that I talk about earlier is a much easier experience for additional services in QuickBooks Online and so as we continue to drive additional fast services we\u2019re going to able to drop annualized accruing revenue. So there is a bankable set of revenue coming in from the ratable revenue shift and \u201816 and \u201817and we see continued acceleration of our subscriber growth which is job one in addition to that we\u2019ll continue to improve retention and then we\u2019ll have the ability to sale additional services which we\u2019re already proven we can do in QuickBooks Online and that drop the acceleration in top-line revenue. And I\u2019ll shift it over the Neil to talk about the margin aspect. Neil Williams :  Yes, I mean cash to get to the $5 a share that we\u2019ve talked about 317 with that revenue level would indicate an operating margin in the mid to high 30s that\u2019s probably one per week build the most confidence and we have the most ability to manage. Just going back to the comment I made earlier I\u2019ll be totally fine if we get more revenue $5 a share with a lower margin percentage in the way we\u2019re getting there now but our assumption we have today is that margins back in mid to half 30s by 2014. Kash Rangan - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : That\u2019s truly tremendous guys I don\u2019t cover many companies that\u2019s have five bucks and earnings per share coming up pretty soon so congratulations on that. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty - JP Morgan :  Hi guys I want to start with I think there you made that the transition would be complete after one year, lot of times the subscription transitions take a couple of years to get to point where you\u2019re seeing the normalized growth and normalized revenue contribution, can you just walk be through highway from here to completion in what timeframe. Brad Smith :  Yes, let us tag team on this but two Sterling. First of all I think it\u2019s important to recognize that we\u2019ve been on this journey for some time we have a large number of customers already signed up on connected services and host the products. Across the company we talk about 45 million customers and little over 30 million are already using hosted products and through mobile devices. And so we\u2019ve just reached this point in small business and then as a result we see it happening in the remaining businesses like pro tax we said let\u2019s just move this entire model now to a ratable revenue model and let\u2019s hit the gap on this file basis option. And so what you see right now is a relatively short transition period for us because we\u2019re already so far down the journey and it give us the ability to bounce back quickly to the double digit top line and bottom line growth that we typically generate. Can you add to that Neil? Neil Williams :  Yes, Brad. It\u2019s really just a couple of other comments just to remind you of. The QuickBooks Desktop and Quicken would probably be close to a three year life as we mentioned in the scripts and those are the longer but the thing to remember is that all of our online customers or most of them, the large part pay monthly. And so a pretty short transition period for those that are converting voluntarily from desktop to online services. As Brad mentioned, probably as much as the third of the impact of this ratable change is in our ProTax solutions and those products are amortized over the tax year, so it will be a little longer than a fiscal year period for us but not much longer maybe 15, 16 months. So, the traditional QuickBooks Desktop and Quicken customers who might be over a longer period time are relatively small part of the transition. So, that\u2019s why it\u2019s a little faster, the recoveries are little sooner than you might see with someone else. Sterling Auty - JP Morgan :  And when you get done, will you have any products where you are recognizing the revenue ratably but the use of the software could be used perpetually or everything will be finally on kind of a term years? Brad Smith : Everything we have, Sterling, will be on a ratable accounting process. It is possible to use the desktop product, if you are not using any connected services and if you are not using any of the other products, we sale that required connectivity. It\u2019s possible we continue to use it longer term. We don\u2019t support it after a three year period of time and all of your connectivity will be terminated but you can still use it if you don\u2019t use any of that. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Gil Luria - Wedbush Securities :  Could you provide a little bit of free cash flow guidance just as a sanity check. It looks like your CapEx is going to up but the changes you are going through as you said are, you are still going to collect the cash up front. So, does that mean approximately flat free cash flow given the higher CapEx? Brad Smith : We are spending a little more in CapEx net year, Gil, than we have. The last few years have been unusually low for us at about $150 or $175 million. We are constructing a new building in Mountain View beginning in 2015 and have some other calls that are pushing us above that, a little above $300 million. So, free cash flow will be roughly flat. Total cash flow up about 8% versus last year. Gil Luria - Wedbush Securities :  Got it and then in terms of the international success of QuickBooks Online, is there one of those particularly countries that\u2019s doing particularly well and can you give us a sense ahead of Analyst Day what are some of your early takeaways about what\u2019s driven that success? Brad Smith :  Yes, Gil, it\u2019s Brad. Actually each of the four countries are outperforming the expectations we had set for ourselves and we have raised those expectations twice in the year. But it really is come down to -- we are treating each market individually in terms of making sure that we understand the local compliance needs. We are winning the hearts and minds of the accounts which are the secret sauce to every country that we are serving. We have great country leadership in each of the four prioritized countries that I mentioned earlier. And we are seeing the ability for us to get the same sort of adoption and then the word of mouth through high net promoter scores that we have seen in the U.S.  So, we now have a formula, our team refers to it as a country in a box which allows us to move from country to country but that doesn\u2019t oversee or it doesn\u2019t overlook the fact that we have to make sure that we have the best product that is more local than the local competition and then from there we have to win the hearts and minds of the accountants and the customers who use the products that they will recommend it to everyone else. And that really has been the formula and we will dive a little bit deeper and show you some things at Investor Day but you are not going to hear a lot different at Investor Day than that, that is the secret sauce. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays: Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions from me. First, and to stay on cash flow, if I think about the 2017, should I have a better cash flow than net income at that point of time and is there any idea for you to kind of maybe start guiding on cash flow because given the more subscription focus of the business that will be your bigger focus? And then just a quick one for Brad on the desktop side and the new program that\u2019s evolving out there, so how do I have to think about that? Is that kind of basically just trying to get them closer to online so that I convert them over time or you expect them to be still desktop customers and you just want to protect them from kind of going to someone else? Neil Williams :  Hey Raimo, this is Neil; I will start off with your first question. I do think we can provide more clarity around cash flow. We will do that at Investor Day, as far as where we are today and what our expectations are, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect cash flow to outpace revenue by the time you get out to 2017 and beyond. But as I mentioned earlier our model is for most customers to pay us monthly that indicates they have got high engagement with the product and it\u2019s the way that really encourages and accelerates customer growth. I think about that more between and my first reaction is I wouldn\u2019t expect cash flow to be significantly faster growth than customers or than revenue by the time we get fully implemented into ratable. Matt Rhodes : And Raimo, it\u2019s Matt. Cash flow growth should be steadier because we are still getting cash from those customers, by the products on the desktop side and you are going to see revenue growth and earnings growth we pick up as we recognize the revenue in later years but the cash will keep coming in so the growth is going to be a little steadier there. You will see more acceleration on revenue growth and op income of EPS growth. Brad Smith : And Raimo I\u2019ll take the second question and I am glad that you asked that because it gives me a chance to explain it for everybody on the call. So you asked about the desktop announcement that we made today and why we\u2019re going to provide ongoing releases. And what does that mean in terms of the outcome for customers. So let me start by saying what is does not mean is adding new features to QuickBooks Desktop, we described these as experience releases because we have the opportunities to build more self-help, eliminate some of those mid-wing things that we know of them getting in the way of desktop users today and also connect some important services like EM voicing or what we talked to you in the past is Intuit commerce network the ability to send an electronic demo voice and they get paid back electronically and move that money in a frictionless way. Those kind of services we know we\u2019re gliders and the really important to keep is customers happy and in the Intuit franchise. So that\u2019s what we wanted to do. Why we\u2019re doing that is because not only our small businesses getting increasingly comfortable with the cloud but as you know the accountants relationship is critical and we have accountants out there today who have some of their customers in the cloud of QuickBooks Online and some of their customers in the Desktop and what we want to be able to do is make sure we support both of those customers and keep them as Intuit advocates. And then as they get increasingly more comfortable their accountant along with our own incentives and our opportunity to earn their trust we will move them to the cloud. Ultimately, our goal is to get them very comfortable with the cloud and help them move to the future because we absolutely know that is a better experience for them it\u2019s a better experience for their accountants and it\u2019s a win overall. So what we\u2019re doing right now is we\u2019re not leaving any of our QuickBooks Desktop customers behind but we are putting all of our new energy, all of our new features and all of our opportunities into the cloud and we\u2019re going to help those customers make it to the cloud on their time frame, not ours. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open please go ahead. Jennifer Lowe - Morgan Stanley : My first question maybe just a follow up on the thought there Brad. You talked in the past about the ability to charge a premium for QuickBooks Online because it\u2019s a premium experience. To the extent that you are rolling in some of these new experienced features for the Desktop product, does that give you more flexibility on Desktop pricing? Brad Smith : Jen, one of the things I would like to not do today is talk a lot about pricing because we haven\u2019t announced anything and we\u2019ll do that a little closer so when we release products and we meet you at Investor Day. What I would say though is that we\u2019re clearly looking for the opportunity to incentivize customers to move to the cloud. And as you mentioned, today Neil described we get about $800 in annualized recurring revenue with QuickBooks Online today and it\u2019s a little less than $500 on the Desktop. We have opportunities in both areas so look at different pricing strategies and different bundling strategies to help customers move to the cloud and we\u2019ll talk more about that as we go down the road. But ultimately our ultimate goal was to make sure we\u2019re delivering a good value for the price so the customer\u2019s stays with us and does not chose another alternative and you will see that show up in some of the decisions that we\u2019ll make in the coming months. Jennifer Lowe - Morgan Stanley : And I have a question hopefully a quick one, everyone is asking about small business but that\u2019s only one of the major franchises you have. As you think about the fiscal \u201917 guidance and overlaying that with some of the commentary around last year being kind of a rebuilding year in the tax business and then expectations of the growth there should improve over a multiyear horizon. Is there any expectation in that fiscal \u201917 guide that there will be an improvement in the growth rate and tax? Brad Smith : Thank you, Jen we do have a lot of other good businesses here and I have to say our consumers have seen us probably start a little bit tax hasn\u2019t come up yet until this point in the call. So that\u2019s very exciting for a lot of reasons. And we have provided a multiyear guidance on the tax business the 5% to 10% obviously this year we delivered 7% and we said that this is the first year of a multiyear journey and we\u2019re encouraged about some of the things our team is working on for next year. But we aren\u2019t this point prepared to adjust anything. You can assume that as we look at our long term model that\u2019s the guidance that\u2019s kind of giving us the confidence that we can put out there in 2017 outlook what we did today and still pretty confident in it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open please go ahead. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Thank you. Neil could you comment on what you see as the biggest risk factors in the fiscal \u201917 earnings guidance that you\u2019ve given out today? Neil Williams : Well, that\u2019s a good question. I think the key components if you think about the online subscriber growth we\u2019ve talked about for QuickBooks it\u2019s a big number, it\u2019s an aggressive growth rate and we feel pretty confident about that. We talked about the margin percentage and I mentioned that\u2019s one of the areas where I feel like we have most control. Clearly we put this outlook out with concerns and with situations pretty much steady state in the global economy and in other external factors. Probably the biggest risk that I would think of is something external to Intuit that would happen in the market or what happens some of our customer or things like that. I think the things were embedded in the guidance we provided to give out to \u201915 and our outlook for \u201916 and \u201917 have taken into account things that are in our control we feel pretty confident about that. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Just as a quick follow up on that Neil in the QuickBooks Online subscriber target for \u201917, how much of that number is from new subscribers versus transition of the desktop franchise. David Togut - Evercore Partners : We definitely think the migration is going to continue to accelerate and there is some things we are going to be doing to do that, probably a fourth roughly of that number will come from our existing base moving over perhaps that\u2019s what you would expect? Brad Smith : It is, we do believe that\u2019s pretty much the range that we have got in our sub growth right now for 2017. Obviously we will view it more successful if we can get more of those customers off the desktop into the cloud but we are trying to be realistic and pragmatic about what we think those customers will be ready to do in the next couple of years. David Togut - Evercore Partners :  Just on that point Brad, what made your functionality still not in QBO that\u2019s in QB Desktop that you need to add to QBO over the next 12, 18 months? Brad Smith : Yes, David obviously we have some work still to do in a few key areas, self-formed customization, job casting and inventory or the ones we hear the most from our small business customers as well as from the accountant. The good news is those are all on the roadmap. We did the acquisition of a small inventory company called Lettuce a couple of months ago and our teams are diligently working to integrate that more deeply into the customer experience. And so we believe by the end of this fiscal year we are going to have the majority of the key functionality that we need for the largest portion of our customers up and running in QuickBooks Online. In each of the different geographies, there is typically a small compliant piece that we have to have done in each of those countries and we believe we will have that fully in place by the end of this first fiscal quarter. So, we are well on our way and I don\u2019t want that to be the reason that people think that the migration isn\u2019t happening quickly because today we actually having a functionality for 70% of our QuickBooks customers on the desktop to move over. It\u2019s simply our opportunity to earn the right to get them to move to the cloud and that\u2019s where we are putting our energy. David Togut - Evercore Partners :  Thanks. Just a quick final question, Neil, do you have a view on possible fiscal \u201816 adjusted EPS, that\u2019s the one number that\u2019s not quite in the guidance. Neil Williams :  David, we are not going to talk about that at this point. We may give you some more direction at Investor Day possibly but we are not going to pen something down at this point. We want to have as much flexibility to get as many customers as we can over the next couple of years. So, we are not going to get more specific and to say that we expect double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion next year. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer:  Thanks. Good afternoon guys. I have a three separate amount of questions. I think I was going to ask in the different order but just of that last question, Neil. I think last year you provided share count guide and I haven\u2019t seen it in the release maybe I missed it. For fiscal \u201815 and then ideally if you had a thought on fiscal \u201817 and if not just to give us a feel for how aggressive you think you will be with buybacks after later than expected in fiscal \u201813 and \u201814? Thanks. Neil Williams :  Scott, the four we usually think about is the least offsetting any dilution from stock based compensation. So, we look at the shares we issue every year and that kind of provides a minimum level that we like to acquire and beyond that it just goes to what\u2019s our availability, whatever opportunities we have to invest our cash during the year and other things that we may be considering or have in the pipeline. So, we don\u2019t typically set a maximum level. We have got, I mentioned we got almost 2 billion remaining in our authorization but we never had a trouble getting more authorization if we have the opportunity based on funding and things like that. But I think of at least enough to keep the share count flat as a minimum level. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Thanks and just a follow-on to that, 10 acquisitions this year, 550 million and are those numbers right? As a group obviously small in size, so is that the M&A strategy going forward or might we see some spark? Thanks. Brad Smith : Scott, we have a strategic game plan in each of our businesses and as you just pointed out our track record tend to be looking at talent or technology tuck-ins that accelerate our time to market to execute those strategies. So, if there is an opportunity that comes along that maybe larger in size and it made strategic sense, we wouldn\u2019t say no but that\u2019s typically not the kind of acquisitions we do. So, I think you can continue to anticipate these kinds of acquisitions and they really are adding acceleration to each of the business units. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks. And swinging over to operational guidance, Brad for tax for fiscal \u201815 I think 5% to 7% is the revenue guide. Could you give, as you have in years past, the breakdown individual federal returns software category share, TurboTax share revenue for return? Brad Smith : Scott, we are going to dive a little deeper on that at Investor Day. It\u2019s still the same four levers and we will show you what we anticipate in an outlook for fiscal year \u201815 at that time. So, I would like to just hold off on that if you don\u2019t mind until we get to the end of September 30th and that will a reason for you to show us and we will get a chance to see and talk to you then. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Sounds good, I will be there and then last one and I might get the same answer but with regard to QuickBooks Online, last year at Investor Day, you said I think it was bridging for five year which would be I guess out of fiscal \u201918, 2 billion incremental QuickBooks, U.S. 1 billion incremental QuickBooks global and now for fiscal \u201817, is there any change to that or is that consistent just on might be measuring apples and oranges but wanted to get a little clarity. Brad Smith :  Yes, actually Scott I\u2019ll give you one on this I won\u2019t make you wait till Investor Day. Unidentified Company Representative :  Thanks. Brad Smith :  So headline number one as your numbers are correct we have an inspirational goal of adding 3 million more QuickBooks customers by 2018. We\u2019ve articulated today that we can see our line of sight to 2 million with high degree of confidence that we\u2019re going to actually tell you today for 2017 I would also tell you that we\u2019re pretty prudent and sometimes conservative and trying to make sure that we can put something out there that we can achieve. And so just anticipate that our team has a different goal than what we\u2019re talking dealers our and our full commitment is to get to that 3 million about 2018. Operator :  Thank you. Our final question for today comes from Jim MacDonald from First Analysis. Your line is open. Please go ahead. James MacDonald - First Analysis :  Good morning guys. Could you give a little more about the organizational changes that go along with your new components of online and desktop and how that works globally as well? Brad Smith :  Yes, Jim it\u2019s Brad, happy to do that. What we ended up doing small business as we took what have been standalone business units, Small Business financial solutions, Small Business Management solutions which is wrote down in the QuickBook payroll payments and then demand for us in QuickBase and we\u2019d say we not need to move to one small business ecosystem but the top priority being online global subscriber growth. And we brought all these businesses together, we reallocated our engineering to focus on the online platforms and then we basically put our energy and to making sure that we got rid of the redundancy where we end up in a Noah\u2019s Ark model. Every one of those businesses had one of everything and when you put them together we ended up with three or four. And so we had some inefficacies there and it allowed us to reallocate resources against the things that would help us accelerate our global expansion, that was really the crux of the old structure is uniting these four individual businesses into one online ecosystem and putting all the energy in resources and to getting to the cloud globally. There is one other aspect of it Jim which is customer care. As you move to a new customer care model in a mobile world customers expect quality to be built-in, if you\u2019re using a mobile app they don\u2019t expect to have the call from one and if they do there is all kinds of new analog like day button from Amazon. So we put more energy into our customer care model for the future and we made some decisions to move out of pieces of customer care that we don\u2019t think are core and we found good partners who will handle that piece for us and that impacted some of our organizational restructure as well. So, all that is under the context of more energy and more resources to online and global with mobile devices. James MacDonald - First Analysis : Great. And going back to somebody other questions as you add these experience all features to the desktop, you mentioned increasing attach on payments but what are your thoughts on attach broader than that for the desktop people as you kind of ease them into the cloud. Brad Smith :  Jim we just touched on important fees, we don\u2019t think we\u2019re pass out in terms of attach rate for QuickBooks Desktop. We do think however we have allowed things to get in the way of the customers being able to have more seamless experience and quite honestly our engineers have been, they haven\u2019t been able to work on those things because if they did it would impact how we have to accounts for the revenue. So we\u2019ve eliminated those barriers and we\u2019re going to have the team focused on making that more seamless experience which allows us to get even improve attach rate in desktop while we build all the new step in QuickBooks Online. So your assumption is correct we should have the ability to continue to get a tax rate in payroll and payment in the desktop probably put all of energy into the cloud. Operator :  Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. Gentlemen, would you like to close with any additional remarks. Brad Smith :  I just want to thank everybody, we know we hit you with a lot, we think very important and different information today if I can just summarize the full year we\u2019re coming out of fiscal year \u201814 with accelerating momentum. We really like our trajectory and we\u2019re making the decisions today to build an even strong future and I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019re going to get a chance to see all of you on September 30th in Mountain View for Investor Day where we share even more information and break this down and to be able to walk through it and talk to you if any question you may have but in the meantime everybody have a great weekend and we\u2019ll speak with you soon. Operator :  Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes our program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

My name is Saeed and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt Rhodes, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Rhodes, you may begin. Matt Rhodes - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, sir. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Intuit\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2015 conference call. I am here with Brad Smith, our President and CEO and Neil Williams, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2013 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brad Smith. Brad Smith - President and Chief Executive Officer : Alright, thanks, Matt and thanks to all of you for joining us. We are out of the gates strong in fiscal 2015. We grew revenue 8% in the first quarter and exceeded our QuickBooks Online subscriber and our company financial targets. It\u2019s a great start, but it\u2019s still early in the year and there is a lot of game left to be played. Let me provide a brief overview of what\u2019s driving these results, beginning with our Small Business performance. We are continuing to accelerate growth in our online ecosystem. QuickBooks Online is generating new customer acquisition, with over 75% of QuickBooks Intuit franchise. We are also actively marketing QuickBooks Online to desktop customers who are cloud-ready. The QuickBooks Online ecosystem is building momentum. We grew total QuickBooks Online subscribers by 43% in the first quarter, up from 40% growth in the previous quarter. We closed Q1 with 739,000 paying subscribers worldwide. Outside the U.S., QuickBooks Online subscribers were up more than 170% to 103,000 further accelerating from last quarter. And the improvements we are seeing in the leading indicators are quite promising with new user attach rates of 12% for payments and 31% for payroll, up from 6% and 20% respectively, a year ago. We remain squarely focused on driving customer growth and increasing market penetration. QuickBooks Online has a very low penetration when you reflect our total addressable market of more than 160 million small businesses globally. Although we are still in terms of taking QuickBooks Online global, we are excited about the huge market opportunity. Adding just one additional point of penetration would more than double our QuickBooks Online subscriber base. The capstone to the quarter for our small business team was our first-of-its-kind QuickBooks Connect event that was held in October. We hosted more than 3,500 attendees, including accounting professionals, small business owners, entrepreneurs and developers. The attendees found inspiration from the main stage, while learning practical advice on how to start and grow their businesses from renowned experts in breakout sessions. At the event, we introduced more than 100 product enhancements and featured a lineup of dynamic speakers that wowed the audience. I am glad some of you on the call were able to attend, and I encourage everyone to consider checking out QuickBooks Connect next fall. With that context around our small business performance, let me now shift to tax. Fiscal 2015 is the second year of a multi-year journey to achieve our product vision of taxes, are done. We are excited about the progress we are making in preparation for the upcoming tax season, but there is still much to do over the next several years. We will continue our focus on improving conversion with a more simple and responsive experience that leverages data to get customers through their tax return with ease and confidence. We will also focus on delivering a unified help and answer experience, driving TurboTax customers to clear explanations on everything tax related, including the Affordable Care Act. We are looking forward to getting our new lineup of solutions out to market in the next few weeks. In the professional tax business, we are seeing strong new customer growth early in the season and our shift to the cloud continues to pick up steam. We intend to build on our leadership position and capitalize on this once-in-a-generation shift to the cloud for accountants. So, in a nutshell, we are off to a great start in fiscal 2015. I am energized by our results as we continue to accelerate customer growth in our online ecosystems. These results reinforce our confidence in the near and long-term financial outlooks that we have provided. And on that note, I will turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details. Neil Williams - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks Brad. Let\u2019s start with overall company results. For the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we reported revenue of $672 million, up 8%, non-GAAP operating loss of $36 million, GAAP operating loss of $114 million, non-GAAP loss per share of $0.10 and a GAAP loss per share of $0.29. As Brad just said, we are off to a strong start, a little ahead of our expectations for the first quarter. Turning to the business segments, total small business group revenue grew 5% for the first quarter. Small business online ecosystem revenue grew 30% and customer acquisition in our online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 43%, accelerating from the previous quarter. Total online active payments customers grew 3%. Online payments charge volume grew 22%, driven by strong growth in payments customers connected to QuickBooks Online. Online payroll customers grew 24% and full-service payroll customers nearly doubled. Rounding out the online ecosystem, Demandforce customers grew 27% for the quarter. Switching to the desktop side, total desktop ecosystem revenue declined 2% and QuickBooks Desktop units declined 23%. This is in line with our expectations as we continue to emphasize QuickBooks Online. QuickBooks total paying customers grew 22% in the first quarter. As we move through the year, we will continue to experiment with our QuickBooks product lineup and our pricing to maximize long-term customer and revenue growth across Small Business. Within the Consumer Group, Consumer Tax revenue was up 36% versus the first quarter last year. As you know, our consumer tax business is highly seasonal and our first quarter is a light one. We will continue to invest in the product experience and to prioritize growth in share and customers above margin expansion. The quarter is also seasonally light for our ProTax group, with revenue growth of 46%. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15%. With approximately $1.6 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. We also look for inorganic opportunities, and in the first quarter we made two acquisitions totaling $10 million. When it\u2019s the best use of cash, we will return cash to shareholders via share repurchases. We repurchased $114 million of shares in the first quarter and we have about $1.8 billion remaining on our authorization. We intend to be in the market consistently during the year. Our Board approved a $0.25 dividend per share for our fiscal second quarter, payable on January 20. This represents a 32% increase versus last year and reflects our large and growing cash position, as well as more recurring and predictable revenue streams. We provided our guidance for the second quarter and reiterated our guidance for full fiscal 2015 in our press release. As a reminder, we will provide tax unit updates in February, concurrent with our second quarter earnings release and in late April after the tax season. Back to you, Brad. Brad Smith - President and Chief Executive Officer : Alright. Thank you, Neil. It\u2019s obviously early in our fiscal year, but we are off to a strong start. QuickBooks Online is accelerating our transition to the cloud, which is driving value for our customers, as well as for Intuit and our shareholders. As I mentioned, I am really pleased with the strong turnout at our inaugural QuickBooks Connect event last month, which helped build awareness of our growing online ecosystem. We now have 425 third-party applications on our partner platform, which is up over 4X from where it was last year. 375 accountants became QuickBooks Online certified at the event itself and collectively, the conference attendees touch more than 1 million small businesses. We are planning to build on the power of these connections throughout the year. We are also gearing up for tax season and we are looking forward to getting our new offerings in the market in the coming weeks. So, we are heading into our busiest time of the year and we are excited about the momentum that we are continuing to build. As always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and their ongoing focus. And with that, Saeed, let\u2019s open it up to hear what\u2019s on everyone\u2019s minds. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Walter Pritchard-Citi: Hi, thanks. Just one question on small business and one question on tax. Could you help us understand on the tax side, we have had a variety of sort of seasonal anomalies over the last several years in terms of more of a front-end loaded or back-end loaded tax season? Could you help us understand kind of how you are thinking about the shape of the tax season as it compares to some of the prior years we have seen here? Brad Smith : Okay, Walter. So, right off the bat, one of the things that\u2019s happened in the last several years has been a delayed tax season, because Congress has acted late to pass certain laws and then the IRS hasn\u2019t been able to open up season on time. While that still remains a potential reality and there have been letters written by the IRS Commissioner to Congress, we are still banking on the fact that the season is going to open up around January 20, but of course we have contingencies in place in the event it does get pushed out for any reason. Beyond that, I think the natural seasonality is what it has been and that\u2019s an increasing procrastination with more people waiting until later in the season to file. We have tried to reflect that in our forecast that ultimately we will have to wait and see how the customer behaves in terms of their tax filing behavior. Walter Pritchard-Citi: And then I guess Neil for you on small business expenses, we just back into that based on your operating income in small business and it looked like you grew your expenses in small business about 8% year-over-year, which is actually less than you grew it in the second half of last year. And it felt like at the Analyst Meeting, you were talking about accelerating some of your investments in small business and you noted you had Connect during the quarter. I guess it seems like you are spending less than we expected in that area. Could you give us some color on that and do you expect that, that spending ramps as we move through the year? Neil Williams : Yes, Walter. I guess, I would say two things about that. First and foremost, our small business team has gone through an extensive resource reallocation during the summer and some of our plans around are recommitting to the online products around our bold initiative that really drove a more extensive resource reallocation. Secondly, I would caution you that the first quarter is just the first one out of the gate and if some of the expenses may show up later in the year, particularly as we rollout additional products offerings and have marketing and things around those events. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much in the first quarter run-rate or necessarily assume that\u2019s indicative of the full year. Walter Pritchard-Citi: And then just last one for you, Neil, I calculate your billings were up sort of high-teens and I am wondering I know most of your business is billed on a monthly basis and I am wondering if we should be looking at sort of revs plus change in deferred as any sort of metric for your business. What are your thoughts there? Neil Williams : Yes. It\u2019s a good question, Walter. And if you look at the first quarter, you don\u2019t see a huge buildup right there, because our desktop product really didn\u2019t go on sale until the first part of October. And so what you see in the first two months of our first quarter is really the desktop sales still under the upfront revenue recognition before the switch to ratable. So, it\u2019s probably worth maybe a point or two maybe in the first quarter would probably be in the total company, probably be in the low-teens without the effects of ratable. It will be much more prominent in second and third quarter. Matt Rhodes : One other thing I would point out quickly, Walter, this is Matt, the desktop payroll business generates some deferred revenue as well and we saw some pretty good growth there this quarter. So that\u2019s showing up in the deferred balance overall for the company too. Walter Pritchard-Citi: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brent Thill-UBS: Thanks. Good afternoon. Brad you mentioned outside the U.S. you saw accelerating momentum and I know it\u2019s early days, but maybe if you could just walk through what you are seeing there and help us understand the prioritization of what is a pretty big opportunity for you when you look outside the U.S.? Brad Smith : Yes, Brent, happy to do that. So as we discussed we have four priority markets outside the U.S. Those are Canada and the UK, Australia and India. And we have now put a tiger team on the ground in France. And we are in the early days of discovering there and getting the product more localized and making sure the compliance that the local market needs. In terms of prioritization we are treating each country as a market of one, so we don\u2019t have one prioritized over other, plus we are testing different concepts. And right now we are seeing acceleration in all four of those markets. And we are seeing increasing gross new subs on a weekly basis. We are learning and getting more accountants aware of the products and signed up for our ProAdvisor program. We are becoming much more effective at direct selling through the websites. And we are also getting very good reviews from the customers and the accountants on how the products stacks up versus competition. We had mentioned in the last call we had a done a study, an independent study in Australia where we actually outperformed the leading online competitor there 2 to 1 terms of ease-of-use. We just replicated that study in the UK and got the same results. So, across the board we are continuing to see strong performance in these countries and now we are in the process of looking at that fifth country being France. And beyond that I would just say that the teams continue to learn every week. They are running rapid experiments and things are looking good. Brent Thill-UBS: Okay. Neil I realized you still have a long way to go on the authorization on the buyback, at the beginning of the year you took an accelerating approach to this, is this something we should continue to factor in the model, just steady ongoing accelerate \u2013 adoption of that buyback or just we would love get your thoughts on that? Thank you. Neil Williams : We had a little over $0.5 billion in buybacks embedded in the guidance we gave you on the share count back in August. And so we will see how that plays out. We executed in Q1 against that plan. But we will see how it plays out. It depends on what other uses we have for our cash and other opportunities we have in the marketplace. So I feel comfortable with the reduction in share count we have guided for 2015. We will see if there are opportunities to go beyond that. Brent Thill-UBS: Great. Thanks. Brad Smith : Thanks Brent. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty-JPMorgan: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Two questions here on in QuickBooks Online, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you are already marketing the solution to the desktop users that are ready, can you just talk us through a little bit more color of how you are reaching out and marketing to them. And remind us I think you talked about 70% of them are probably able to make the switch. So how should we think about you increasing that marketing as you can reach out to you when 100% are ready to make the switch? Brad Smith : Hi, Sterling, it\u2019s Brad. First of all we are continuing to reach out to our desktop customers through both their accountant who is the most trusted advisor because we find that one out of two decisions are actually directed by the accountants. So we have been working with them, with the new QuickBooks Online for accountants. We have a very compelling ProAdvisor program that gives them incentives to help them get their clients over to the cloud. Of course, the other thing we have been doing is we have been directly marketing to our own customer base and we do that through but direct response as well as in the product. And we are getting really good receptivity. In terms of the actual number of customers you can migrate now, our goal is to have as many as 70% by the end of this fiscal year. Right now it\u2019s more in the neighborhood of about third \u2013 a third of the customers could move over. And what we are doing to close that gap is basically closing out the feature functionality things that they are used to having in desktop like advanced inventory, job costing, sales form customization. And then the other thing we are doing is we are just making the migration process seamless for them, not only for accounting but also for payroll and payments. So when you put it together we are working with the accountants to get them comfortable and encourage them to recommend. We are directly marketing to the customer base through director response and in the product and then we are also closing out those remaining feature gaps so that more of those customers can make that move. Sterling Auty-JPMorgan: And then the follow-up is, when we look at the subscriber additions throughout the fiscal year, how should we think about seasonality meaning which are the quarters are naturally going to see probably stronger subscriber growth versus others? Brad Smith : Yes. So what we are seeing still is there is a natural timeframe in the first of the calendar year where many small businesses will consider making a switch or many accountants figure that\u2019s a good time to get their client to start something new. But when you start thinking about small businesses overall, a lot of that behavior was shaped from the fact that we were desktop software and we used to send a new version out on Black Friday and then ultimately people would start to make the switch in the new calendar year. So, there isn\u2019t as much seasonality in the cloud as there was in desktop, but there is still the sort of first of the year phenomenon. So, you will see more customers start to consider that switch in that January timeframe, but you are going to start to see a little more evening out over four quarters versus what we used to experience in the desktop. Sterling Auty-JPMorgan: Great, thank you. Brad Smith : You are welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan- Merrill Lynch : Hi. My goal is to ensure that I am not asking a Splunk question on the Intuit call, so\u2026 Brad Smith : Hey, Kash, we will take any question you want to ask. Kash Rangan- Merrill Lynch : I will ask a question on Autodesk on your call, I am kidding. With respect to QBO, obviously nice start in the quarter, can you give us a sense, Brad and Neil, of the new QBO subscribers that you brought on board? What attach rate did you experience for payments and payroll and how do you compare the trend in recent quarters? And I am also curious to get your perspective on as a result of getting this first quarter out of the way, how much more incrementally confident are you in the 2 million sub goal and the associated attach metrics for payroll and payments? Thank you. Brad Smith : Alright, Kash. Happy to do that. This is Brad. So, first and foremost, we are really excited with the momentum in QuickBooks Online in terms of subscriber growth. We had anticipated the neighborhood of 715,000 for the quarter. As you now, we provided that guidance. We closed the quarter in the neighborhood of 739,000. So, we are ahead on subscriber growth, perhaps what\u2019s equally if not more exciting is the attach rates for new users. In terms of the actual payments attach rate, it was 12% for new users, that\u2019s up from 6% a year ago and for payroll attach rates it adds up from 20% a year ago. So, not only are the subscriber base growing faster than we had forecasted, but the attach rates are much healthier than they were 12 months ago. In terms of confidence, you might imagine that gives us continuing and increasing confidence and the guidance that we provided both for this year as well as over the next 3 years. We also readily admit we are one quarter into this journey. So, there is still a lot of game and a lot of time left on the clock, but if we keep this momentum up, we are feeling very good. Kash Rangan- Merrill Lynch : Great. And if I could, you don\u2019t have to answer it if there is no answer, but what are the things that you are watching and we should be watching that will give you confidence to alter your longer term outlook? I think you have a goalpost of about 2 million QBO subs, what are the things that you are looking for qualitatively, quantitatively that could help you revisit that number? That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Neil Williams : Kash, this is Neil. Probably the best thing we can do is just continue to post good increases quarter after quarter and we have talked about a guidance of 800,000 subscribers by the end of Q2, which would put us right on track for the guidance we have given for this full year. So, one of the great things about monitoring this quarter-by-quarter is we will be able to see and you will be able to see as well if we are trending to the guidance into the outlook that we gave for 2015 as well as for 2017. So, we really can\u2019t point to anything beyond that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jennifer Lowe- Morgan Stanley : Great, thank you. I wanted to double back a little bit on the comment that around a third of the base is now potentially primed to move over to QuickBooks Online and you would like to see that go to 70% by the end of this year. As you think of those customers in the Desktop base that have the potential to move to QuickBooks Online, what are sort of the things preventing that from happening right now? Is it just the change management around moving to a new solution, is it price, how do you sort of think about those blockers and what you can do to kind of get people past them? Brad Smith : Yes, Jennifer, it\u2019s Brad. I mean, first of all, I think the most important thing is we don\u2019t need to get that customer base to move over if they are not comfortable. We are getting 75% of our customers new to the franchise and that\u2019s really what we are about is trying to increase the penetration into the total addressable market. The migration of these customers is really based upon their comfort level, their accountants\u2019 comfort level and thus having the product ready to the point where they can move over and not lose any important functionality. So, what\u2019s really today slowing that migration is the fact that we still have some areas like inventory, job costing, some sales forms customization that some of these customers want to have. And so we need to make sure we have that built out and in a place where they are going to feel comfortable moving over. And the second thing is just making the migration process seamless. We have a three clicks, three minutes conversion of your data from small business accounting. But at the same time we have to make that just as easy to move your payments and your payroll data. And so we have been working on that and it\u2019s a combination of the features as well as having that migration process mapped out. For us the big juice is the accountants. And the accountants is increasingly excited about QuickBooks Online for their clients and now that we have rolled out the new version of QuickBooks Online for the accountants, which we unveiled at QuickBooks Connect, we are seeing a much more excited enthusiastic accountant base wanting to get their clients over to the cloud. So it\u2019s those things that are going to really help these customers migrate. Keep in mind that we are agnostic, whether they stay in QuickBooks Desktop or they move to QuickBooks Online, its all goodness for us and we are ultimately trying to just increase the penetration into the total addressable market. Jennifer Lowe- Morgan Stanley : And then just one last one for me, I think Neil in your prepared remarks you mentioned that in fiscal \u201815 there will be some experimentation with the QuickBooks line up and with pricing to try and maximize adoption, can you just provide a little bit more color there whether that\u2019s relevant to new users, existing users, both, how should we think about what potentially could play out? Neil Williams : Sure, Jennifer. Some of this you have already seen, we have raised the price of desktop when the new release came out this year to sort of rebalance the price value equation. And as Brad said make us of agnostic as to which product the customer chooses. We introduced QuickBooks Online as self-employed which is a simpler, less expensive version of add to the line up. And so \u2013 and we are testing the way we present those choices to customers in the lineup. And one of the beautiful things about online is you can do a lot of A-B testing to determine what resonates with the customers most. And I really we are going to continue to experiment with that with our promotional strategy and things like that throughout the year to determine what\u2019s the right equilibrium for customers and we certainly don\u2019t want the price value equation to be a barrier for someone to convert to QuickBooks Online. So those are a couple things that are out in the market already. And I think we will continue to experiment with things like that is year goes on. Jennifer Lowe- Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Dunham from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Frank Robinson- Goldman Sachs : Hi. Yes, Frank Robinson on for Greg Dunham. The QuickBooks Desktop unit sales declined 23% much more meaningfully than the 10% - 11% from last year and last quarter, what are your thoughts or expectations for that going forward? Brad Smith : Yes, Frank it\u2019s Brad. First of all, the desktop decline for the outright sale, the people who purchased it and just have the three year license was in the zip code of what we expected. We expected a decline of 20% to 25%, which you also have to look at on the fact sheet is the number of people signing up for QuickBooks Desktop subscriptions. And when you add in that growth of people who have moved off of an outright sale to subscriptions and then you also add in the desktop sales, the total base on QuickBooks Desktop is only down about 2%. And so net-net, it\u2019s where we expected it to be 20% to 25% is where about we anticipated on the outright sales. We saw the migration moving to subscriptions and/or to the cloud version of the product, so we are right where we thought we would be in terms of the desktop performance. Frank Robinson- Goldman Sachs : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Yun Kim-Jefferies: Thank you. This is Yun Kim for Brad. Again, very strong QBO subscriber number Brad another strong quarter of attach rate improvement for new QBO subs which to me indicates that the quality of new subs was pretty strong. Will \u2013 would we ever see a case or are you willing to accelerate subscriber adds that may be of a lower quality and may not result in attach improvement and along the line is the attach rate improvement somewhat driven by desktop QuickBooks transition who may have a higher attach rates than the new QBO to franchise? Thanks. Brad Smith : Okay. And can you \u2013 I am sorry could you just repeat the second part of your question I missed that? Yun Kim-Jefferies: Yes, sure. So I am assuming that the transition from desktop to the online have a higher attach rate than the people who are new to the QBO franchise, just wondering how has that improvement \u2013 how are you actually \u2013 actually I think that attach rate when people are transitioning from desktop to online? Brad Smith : Got it. Okay. Thank you. So first of all, the quality of the new subs to QuickBooks Online is very healthy and we are excited about the life time value of those customers. We talked about the attach rates earlier for new users. And we are opening up the funnel increasingly in two ways. One is as we begin to move globally, we are reaching into countries where we don\u2019t yet have payroll and payments. And so I think what you are going to see is in early stage, where we may just have a small business accounting customer and then we will work with partners to close the payroll and payments gaps. And then over time, we will round that ecosystem out on our own. In fact, the two acquisitions we did in the first quarter of this year were both global acquisitions and so one of them was actually a payroll provider in the UK. So, that\u2019s one of the things you will see in terms of what you categorized as maybe a lower quality customer for attach. We actually don\u2019t view it as a lower quality we simply view it as an earlier stage customer or an earlier market for us where we are still building out the ecosystem. The other way that you will see the attach rates potentially getting impacted is as we go after QuickBooks Self-Employed, these are customers who today don\u2019t believe they were big enough to need a small business accounting product that they do need to separate their personnel from their business expense and then come tax time, be able to send that data to TurboTax or to an accountant to be able to follow Schedule C. And so they may not have payroll needs, because they are a sole proprietor and they probably do need payments, but they may not have the same lifetime value. So, those are the two things that you will see ultimately impact the how big the funnel is and what the attach rates will be over time. Desktop to Online, you are absolutely correct we expect those attach rates from desktop customers moving over. They tend to be more established. Those should be healthier attach rates on things like payroll and payments. And so we are excited as more customers get comfortable moving to the cloud that, that\u2019s only a tailwind for us. Yun Kim-Jefferies: Okay, great. And then just the same attach rate kind of question, what was the improvement, if any for the existing QBO install base? Brad Smith : Well, we track that in terms of total penetration into the base. And payroll was now at about 19% penetration and it was from a base of 16% penetration a year ago. So, that\u2019s 300 basis points, which is pretty healthy against a total base and payments is now about 5% and that\u2019s up from about 3% penetration a year ago, so once again, almost double. So, the total base is benefiting here as well. Yun Kim-Jefferies: Okay, great. Thank you so much. Brad Smith : You are welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Macdonald from First Analysis. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jim Macdonald- First Analysis : Yes, good afternoon guys. You talked about the QuickBooks Desktop price, any other price built into your assumptions for this year? Brad Smith : Jim, in small business or across the company or\u2026. Jim Macdonald- First Analysis : Well, I know you probably won\u2019t talk about tax too much, so mostly small business. Brad Smith : Well, yes, obviously our pricing strategy is what we call pricing for value. So, on the lower end of the market, we often start with free or we introduce new products things like QuickBooks Self-Employed which are a little more affordably priced. And then on the higher end of the market, we will look for opportunities to take price increase and you have seen us do some of that with QuickBooks Enterprise, including moving to subscription versions of QuickBooks Enterprise. In payroll, we introduced a new pricing philosophy, which basically paid by employees to the number of employees you actually have a charge for each employee you add and that gives us a little pricing leverage as well. But by and large, there hasn\u2019t been a fundamental change in our pricing strategy, it\u2019s price for value, stay really competitive on the low end, make sure that we are disruptive, but taking value on the high end. Jim Macdonald- First Analysis : Great. As a follow-up, I think you have said in your remarks that your full service payroll doubled or nearly doubled, maybe you could talk a little more about that? Brad Smith : Yes, it did. As you know that is an exciting product for us that we introduced couple of years ago. It\u2019s still early days. The subscriber base continues to build up. We are roughly now about 25,000 active customers in full service payroll. We just introduced the ability now to also sell it to QuickBooks Online customer. So, there is seamless integration between QuickBooks Online, which we think is really going to be an accelerant for this business. It\u2019s priced about a third cheaper than the payroll outsourcers and yet provides the same value and benefit in terms of protecting you against any errors. And so, this is an exciting product for us. And we think there is nothing, but upside in this full service payroll product. Jim Macdonald- First Analysis : Great. Thanks a lot. Brad Smith : Alright, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger-Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good afternoon. Neil\u2026. Brad Smith : Scott, we lost you buddy. Operator : Sir, if you have your phone on mute, can you un-mute your phone please? Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Ross MacMillan-RBC Capital Markets : Thanks a lot and apologies for my voice. I have got a cold so hopefully you can hear me. I had a question just going back to attach. I think what you are saying is that your QBO, that cohort of new customers, actually now not only has a higher attach across payroll and payments relative to last year, but I think higher than the aggregate base across the entire QuickBooks install base including desktop users, so I guess just if that\u2019s true which I think is true, what is your expectation for that how evolves, do you think that there is going to be a shift back so that the QBO customers in aggregate will have maybe a lower attach than that cohort in the future, just maybe help me understand how you would expect that to evolve, that will be helpful. Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes. Ross, so first of all, your hypothesis is true. Not only are the cohorts attaching at a higher rate than prior QuickBooks Online they are also attaching at a higher than desktop. And this has been the thesis we have had all along. It\u2019s much easier to sell additional services in the cloud than it is in a desktop product. It\u2019s just a seamless part of the experience. It\u2019s built into the workflow. And we have often said that we felt that we were not anywhere near the total potential of selling additional services to our install base, it was a matter of execution and making it seamless for customers. So just think about payroll today, in the small business base of QuickBooks Desktop customers, of the 4 million roughly 2.5 million of them actually have employees and pay a payroll service. And today we only have about 1 million of them as customers. So we never reached our full potential in desktop. When it transfers to the cloud and makes it a lot easier for us to introduce them to additional services same thing goes on with payments. One out of two small businesses are accepting credit and debit cards today. We had single digit penetration as we move to the cloud we think it\u2019s a real opportunity for us to really increase that penetration. So there is upside here. And I think you are going to continue to see these numbers outperform the base as well as improve in terms of the cohorts. Ross MacMillan-RBC Capital Markets : That\u2019s very helpful. Just a quick follow-up on aggregate QuickBooks customer growth, I know you said 22% but it\u2019s a bit of a funky number because it includes perpetual units in period and subscribers which is obviously a growing pool of users. My adjustments suggest something around 5% growth if I annualize the perpetual units and I think that\u2019s more in keeping with the 6% you saw last year. So I guess my question is what are your views on total QuickBooks customer growth, are we likely to see that total pool of customers continue to grow and do you think it could actually even accelerate from the 6%? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes. So Ross, I would tell you I think first of all as you did the math you are in the zip code of what we are seeing too. So when you make all the adjustments, that\u2019s pretty much in the zip code of where we are. And we do think that we will continue to grow over time as we introduce QuickBooks Online to a whole new base of customers and three out of four of them are new to the Intuit franchise that\u2019s going to deepen our penetration into our existing markets. And as we introduce QuickBooks Online in new countries that introduces new opportunities for us to grow the customer base, but right now in terms of the aggregate number that you talked about that\u2019s the we are viewing it and we think there is only upside potential there. Ross MacMillan-RBC Capital Markets : Great and maybe one very quick short last one on tax, just curious do you have any view as to whether the additional form surrounding ACA this year could have an influence on the timing of when parts of the filer base might actually file thinking that it could trade even more delays for a portion of the filer base, what are your thoughts around that? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes. Ross, I think this is one we are going to have to wait and see how the consumer behavior plays out. I mean obviously we feel very good as we are heading into season with what our team has been to able to achieve and what we have tested over the summer. For the majority of our customers the only thing that we will have to do is check a box to be compliant with ACA. And then for those who actually have the Form 8962, we have turned that into a simple interview like question just like we do in TurboTax and we think we are going to make that pretty simple as well. Now whether or not someone sits at home and waits to file because they are trying to process the healthcare implications that something no one knows we are just going to have to wait and see. But we haven\u2019t seen any behavior so far that tells us that that\u2019s a guarantee. Ross MacMillan-RBC Capital Markets : Great. Thanks again and congrats on the numbers. Brad Smith : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger-Oppenheimer: Thanks. Hi guys. I hope you can hear me this time. I am going to ask two questions upfront just so I don\u2019t get before I get dropped in a bad spot. First one, Neil I know retention is very important to QuickBooks Online over the long-term if you can just elaborate on that and who things are going near-term, just any comments on retention rate? And then the second question is just progress on your Check acquisition from earlier this year and you gave a little color on one of the two acquisitions you made in the quarter, maybe discuss the other one please? Thanks. Brad Smith : Okay. Do you want to talk about QBO retention? I will take Check. Neil Williams : Yes. You are right, Scott, retention is probably one of the biggest levers we have to improve the lifetime value of QuickBooks Online long-term as one of the things we are critically focused on. We were really pleased with our retention numbers for Q1 and we are looking hard to see what we can do to increase and improve that as we move throughout the year. There are number of things from the quality of the release when it goes out to our care experience to the agents and we have talked about it back in August that we have moved a lot of our care resources back onshore. We think that\u2019s a critical part to ensuring that customers who are using QBO get the benefits and the experience that they expect when they subscribe and keeping them in the franchise. And as you well know, it\u2019s much easier to drive engagement and to be connected to those customers when they are using it online. So, we like where retention started out in Q1. We think there is still opportunities to improve that and we certainly want to keep it high. Brad Smith : Yes. And Scott, it\u2019s Brad. I will take the Check acquisition. I was just in Israel visiting the team last week, very excited about the opportunities here. We sequenced and prioritized the work that they are taking on in the first year. Anytime you bring two companies together, there is new ways of working together, you want to work through. So, their number one priority right now is getting the Check Bill Pay capability built into Mint, renamed as Mint Bills. They are also working with our Quicken base to do the same thing and we have a team working in concert with QuickBooks Online to begin to look at ways to facilitate payments between consumers and the small businesses to use QuickBooks Online. So, those are their top three priorities in that order. In terms of the teams coming together and how the employees are feeling, they are very excited, they were energized to be a part of this process and they see big opportunity ahead of them. And so we are pretty bullish right now on the Check opportunity. Neil Williams : You mentioned KDK that was the other acquisition we did\u2026. Brad Smith : Yes, go ahead. You can do. Neil Williams : Yes. The other acquisition Scott was a company called KDK in India and this is a company that does professional tax software in India, but the interesting thing about them to us is they have relationships with over 20,000 accountants in India, which as you know is a key means for us to get deeper penetration with QuickBooks Online. So, we are delighted with that. The team that came over from KDK is very engaged, very excited to be part of Intuit. And we are really just getting started, but we are delighted with the ability to reach more accountants with QBO and therefore small business customers through the accountant relationship. Scott Schneeberger-Oppenheimer: Great. Thanks very much guys. Brad Smith : Alright. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Michael Millman from Millman Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Millman- Millman Research : Thank you. I am following up on your discussion about during this summer working with some of your tax clients regarding ACA whether you get or can describe fear or no concern about doing it on the parts of at least those you spoke with. And in the last two years could you tell us the percent I am sure I guess repeat the percentage of your new tax users that came from assisted trying to get some notion of how important that is and whether that could be delayed because of ACA? Brad Smith : Okay. Mike, first of all, in terms of the tests over the summer what we found was a great sense of relief. While it\u2019s clearly something that sounds complicated on the surface and many of our competitors are trying to make that more complicated and scary when then get in and find just how user friendly the tools are like the Affordable Care Act calculator, our TurboTax exemption check process we can go in for free and see whether or not you are qualified for an exemption to the penalty. There is a tremendous sense of release \u2013 relief. And ultimately as you know about 100 million people visit TurboTax.com every year. So we have got a large audience coming in and I think we are able to break through that fear, uncertainty and doubt with very simple tools and ways to help people understand this isn\u2019t a scary that some people would like you to believe. The second piece of it is \u2013 sorry you want to \u2013 you got to go ahead? Matt Rhodes : You were asking about the share we took from assisted Michael? Brad Smith : Yes. Go ahead. Matt Rhodes : Yes. So this is Matt. When we look at the category overall within software we took a couple of point of share. As you can see the software category grew about 5% last year a little better and assisted was roughly flat. So we think we took share across the board and we will continue to. One of the things we want to focus on is driving an experience online for our customers that gives them the confidence to do it themselves at about a quarter of the cost of going to assisted, so that will continue to be our focus. Michael Millman- Millman Research : Okay. So is it fair to say that you don\u2019t see those on assisted staying where they are because of some uncertainty? Brad Smith : Michael, we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case. We have shared before that when you look at when Massachusetts introduced the similar concept years ago there was no behavior change in terms of people wanting to stay entrenched or even switch methods. We continue to see a shift towards do it yourself software and we believe that\u2019s going to continue to be the case here with the federal program of the Affordable Care Act. Michael Millman- Millman Research : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Gentlemen I am showing no further questions at this time. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Saeed, I would. I just want to thank everybody for the questions today. We are off to a strong start. We are clearly building momentum and we are looking forward to our peak season which is coming up in the next couple of months. We want to wish everybody a safe and happy holiday season and hopefully we will get the chance to speak with you soon. And with that we will sign off. So thanks a lot. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

My name is Sayeed and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Rhodes, Intuit\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rhodes, you may begin. Matt Rhodes : Thank you, sir. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2015 conference call. I am here with Brad Smith, our President and CEO; and Neil Williams, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brad Smith. Brad Smith : All right, thank you Matt, and thanks to all of you for joining us. It has been an eventful few weeks at Intuit and I suspect you have lots of questions. Before we get to your questions, I would like to provide as much context around the recent events as possible while keeping the bigger picture in mind. The bigger picture is straightforward. Our financial results are strong through the first half of fiscal 2015 and we are reiterating our guidance for the full fiscal year. Furthermore, our small business momentum has taken a step rate change in a positive direction. The growth in our QuickBooks Online subscriber continuing to accelerate at a very healthy rate. With that said, I know the tax is on everybody\u2019s mind, given the time of year and the recent press coverage. So let me start there first. At the highest level, our tax strategy is on track. We are in the second year of a multiyear journey to achieve our product vision of taxes are done. This year\u2019s TurboTax significantly expanded its data import capability. Nearly 75% of customers can now digitally import W2s directly into the product that is up from less than 30% last year. This is a huge step towards our vision if taxes are done, making tax spreads easier and more accurate and this has led to several points of improvement and conversion for customers who choose to import their data. The TurboTax experience now uses more advanced data driven insights to tailor the interview to your unique situation. We refer this as responsive experience and is saving significant time and questions off of the average taxpayers preparation experience. In addition, TurboTax users can now seamlessly move across platforms, working online on tablets or on smartphones with the ability to start, stop and continue their taxes on the device of their choice. And for the first time ever Americans with more straightforward tax needs were able to file both their Federal 1040A or 1040EZ returns as well as their state returns for free. This was a powerful offer for this 60 million Americans, many of whom with paycheck-to-paycheck and count on their tax refund as being the biggest paycheck that they will receive in the year. The collective impact of these innovations is showing up in the customer experience. So far this season, our ability to convert those who visit the TurboTax.com website and to those who file a return is up a couple hundred basis points. This improvement is on top of a big advance in conversion that we drove last year as well. Our net promoter scores for TurboTax Online are also up about a half dozen points, which is quite encouraging. This improved product experience is helping reduce customer care calls, which were down roughly 20% year-over-year. And when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, we worked hard to ensure that all tax payers could easily and accurately meet the new ACA requirements with TurboTax. Unlike some other tax services, TurboTax includes all the necessary healthcare forms for free. We don\u2019t see any evidence that ACA is driving TurboTax customers to other tax prep solution. In fact, the ACA section of our product has been one of our highest converting tax topics this year, which gives us confidence that our ACA implementation is meeting our customers\u2019 needs. Translating the sum total of these initiatives, total TurboTax units grew 11% through February 14 versus the comparable prior year period. TurboTax Online units are up 19%, while TurboTax Desktop units are down 7%, which takes to me the recent events of the past few weeks, which has not been our best in terms of customer confidence. There were no excuses when you make a mistake and we owned our mistakes and taken steps to make things right. At the same time, we\u2019ve been at the forefront of the ongoing battle to fight fraud in the U.S. tax system, navigating lots of misinformation along the way. Let me share some important context around both of these events. First, let me address the change to the TurboTax Desktop product lineup, which we subsequently reversed. We didn\u2019t live up to our customer expectations and our net promoter scores are down for the TurboTax Desktop product as a result. So why do we make the change in the first place and what have we learned from the experience. I don\u2019t need to tell anyone on this call that we are in the midst of a massive platform shift of the cloud, and every established technology company is dealing with the balance of serving customers on legacy products while advancing their efforts and serving new customers on the next generation platform. It\u2019s no longer a desktop software world. Our computers no longer come equipped with optical drive and shelf space allocated software is down 50% in retail stores over the last five years. But that said, a subset of customers simply do not want to move to the cloud. Many of these are long-term loyal customers, who have used the same product for 20 years, which is why we've always been steadfast in our position that we won\u2019t push a software delivery model on a customer. With that context what happened? Well, last year, we had moved to a complexity baseline up in our TurboTax Online portfolio, steering customers to the best offering for their particular tax situation. This included moving Schedule C, D, E, and F from the looks into our premier and our home and business solution. These are the schedules that enable to file or to report items such as investment gains and losses and small business expenses. Our goal was simplification. So customers were clear, which product was right for their particular tax needs. For over 20 million online customers last year, the implementation went smoothly. So this year, we thought to complete the alignment by making similar changes to our desktop offerings. Our goal was to streamline product development and bring any new innovation from our online product back to our desktop customers as well. And for those who might eventually choose to migrate to the cloud, they would enjoy a consistent and familiar product experience. Good intensions but misinformed. These loyal long-time desktop customers simply didn\u2019t want a different product experience. And they certainly didn\u2019t want to have to upgrade and pay a higher price for the functionality that they have always had in the looks. In addition, we didn\u2019t make the communication clear enough and we didn\u2019t make the transition easy. For the 3% of TurboTax customers who were affected, it was simply unacceptable and they were right. So here is what we\u2019ve done. Following a very public and heartfelt apology, we announced that next year, we will offer the TurboTax to looks Desktop software that our customers know and love, restoring all the forms that they've counted on for years. Returning Deluxe desktop customers who need to upgrade this tax season are now able to do so seamlessly within the product for free. More importantly, what lessons did we learn? First, know the customer. We're a customer back company and we didn't effectively apply our own expertise to this situation. Second, ease to transition; if you're going to make product changes, make sure you have early dialogue with the customers and make the transition slowly. And finally, act quickly and decisively. When you hear noise, assume smoke means fire and jump on the situation fast. Which takes me to the more recent news surrounding the concerns of increasing fraudulent activity in the U.S. tax system, particularly at the state level. As we have shared on many occasions, the privacy and security of our customers\u2019 data is the top priority in our Company. We've been working for years to apply the most advanced technologies and techniques to ensure the safety and privacy of our customers\u2019 information and we have been doing this in conjunction with the overall industry and with government as well. I was just in Washington three weeks ago, giving a key note to more than 100 policy leaders on this very topic. In more recently, Intuit and some states saw an increase in suspicious filings. As a result several states communicated their intention to stop accepting TurboTax e-file. So we took the precautionary step on Thursday, February 5th to temporarily pause the transmission of e-file state tax returns for all states. After our preliminary examination of the recent activities with the help of a third security expert was concluded. We believe and we continue to believe these instances of fraud did not result from security breach of our systems and the information being used to file fraudulent returns was obtained from other sources outside the tax preparation industry. We implemented targeted security measures to combat the type of fraudulent tax activity that we were seeing. These additional steps included the implementation of more advanced multi-factor authentication, which is a proven technology for protection against identity theft. With these measures in place, we resumed e-filing with the state the next day. Once, we felt comfortable that our customers\u2019 privacy and security were not at increased risk. And we're continuing to work with the state as they build their own anti-fraud capabilities and we will continue to share best practices as we work towards the common best interest of the taxpayer. To assist any customers, who are victims of tax fraud, we\u2019re providing a dedicated toll free number with direct access to specially trained identity protection agents, who will provide comprehensive support and filing assistance. So to summarize consumer tax, the underlying health of the business and the product innovations that we're delivering are having a meaningful impact on the customer experience and on our result season today. With that said, we suffered a self-inflicted wound on the desktop line-up situation, and we are leading the battle against an industry wide threat of cyber fraud targeting the US tax system. And all of this happened within the first few weeks of a 100 day tax season. But there is plenty of time left on the clock and if you look at the scoreboard so far, you'll see that the IRS data through February 6th shows that self-prepared e-file growth was up 70%, contrasted with assisted e-files down 4%. This leads us to believe that the do-it-yourself software category continues to gain share. TurboTax e-file growth and other third party data also indicate that we\u2019re gaining a couple points of share so far this season. So we\u2019re keeping the bigger picture inline and we\u2019re going to emerge from both of recent situations wiser and even more focused. Which takes me to the pro-tax side of the business, where we\u2019re seeing positive early trends and customer acquisition. In addition, we\u2019re delivering more innovation in pro-tax than I have ever seen in my time at Intuit. We provided tools and training for our pro-customers to manage the ACA situation and to help their clients achieve the best possible outcomes. We\u2019ve refreshed TurboTax Personal Pro, which we used to call CPA Select, and we expect the new interface and the accountants\u2019 engagement tools to drive growth. We\u2019ve launched Intuit Link, a data and document collaboration tool for accountants that save time and simplify the accountants to client communication and we\u2019ve enabled eSignature capabilities that help accountants streamline their work and securely transmit signatures on important forms. I realize that I don\u2019t need to remind anyone that it\u2019s early in the season for both of our tax businesses, but I will. We\u2019re staying agile and I am very pleased with our products and our pace of innovation. We\u2019re focused on improved execution and delivering for our customers and shareholders for the remaining season. Now, let\u2019s talk small business. As I foreshadowed earlier, the QuickBooks Online ecosystem continues to build strong momentum. We grew total QuickBooks Online subscribers by 50% in the second quarter that is up from 43% growth last quarter. We added 100,000 QBO subscribers quarter-over-quarter and we now have 841,000 paying subs worldwide. Outside the U.S. QuickBooks Online subscribers were up more than 170% to a 127,000 in line with last quarter\u2019s rapid growth. Our QuickBooks Online customers continue to add payroll and payment solutions at a healthy clip. In the U.S., our new customer online payroll attach rate was 21%,. This is a step down from roughly 30% last quarter, but it\u2019s due to a change from an opt-out payroll signup to an opt-in. We expect our attach rate to be in the low 20s over the next few quarters but we expect to see improvements in retention as a result of this change. Our online payments attach rate was 8%, which is up from 7% a year ago. To help fuel our international growth, we made two acquisitions in the past quarter that will add key features and functionality to the QBO ecosystem and targeted geographies. In the UK, we acquired Acrede, a provider of payroll solutions with global compliance and data security. They are easy to use cloud technology can be customized to deliver payroll across multiple geographies. We also acquired ZeroPaper, a developer of fast and mobile financial management tools for entrepreneurs and micro businesses in Brazil. In addition to these acquisitions, we launched QuickBooks Self-Employed, designed specifically for the rapidly expanding population of freelancers and independent contractors. As you may recall, there are roughly 12 million of these businesses in the U.S. Our QuickBooks Self-Employed Solution helps the smallest of small businesses, manage their finances throughout the year, and provides integration with TurboTax to simplify tax reporting. These sole proprietors generally don\u2019t see a need for all the functionality and traditional QuickBooks online. They simply need to keep their personal and their business expenses tracked and separated for tax time. This product is gaining real momentum and I\u2019m excited about the partnerships we recently announced with Stripe, Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, and others all centered around this particular market. We\u2019ll continue to add partners to expand our presence in this rapidly growing on-demand services marketplace. So in total, it\u2019s been an eventful first half of the year and it has been a strong first half as well. I\u2019m inspired by our team\u2019s commitment to overcome obstacles, while continuing to reimagine the tax prep experience in both our consumer and our pro-tax businesses and you\u2019re going to see much more innovation from these teams over the next few years. On the small business half of the house, our small business subscriber growth is accelerating and we remain focused on global customer acquisition, all being powered by cloud-based services. With that overview, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details. Neil Williams : Thanks, Brad. First, I'll start with overall company results, which all came in higher than our guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we delivered revenue of $808 million, up 3%, a non-GAAP operating loss of $20 million, a GAAP operating loss of $98 million, a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.06, and a GAAP loss per share of $0.23. These factors reflect our strategic decision to deliver ongoing services and releases for future desktop offerings. As a result, revenue for future desktop software licenses will be recognized as services are delivered rather than up-front. As we discussed previously, approximately $400 million in revenue will move out of fiscal 2015 into later years. The impact and quarter seasonality of this shift varies by business unit. The business with a shift is hardest to understand from an external perspective is probably professional tax. I\u2019ll provide some data to help with modeling of the pro-tax business in a moment. Turning to the business segments. Total small business group revenue declined 1% for the second quarter. Again reflecting the impact of changes to the desktop product resulting in ratable, rather than up-front revenue recognition. QuickBooks total paying customers grew 20%. Small business online ecosystem revenue grew 26% and customer acquisition in our online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks online subscribers grew 50%, accelerating from last quarter\u2019s growth rate. Online payroll customers grew 23%, online active payments customers grew 3%, and online payments charge volume grew 20%, driven by an increase in charge volume per customer. Payments customers attached to QuickBooks Online grew over 90%. We\u2019re focused on growing payments in the QBO ecosystem while de-emphasizing other services such as standalone GoPayment\u2019s customers. Rounding out the online ecosystem, Demandforce customers grew 18%. Our primary goal is converting non-consumption to capture a larger share of the 29 million small businesses in the U.S. and millions more around the world. To do this, we\u2019re leaning into QuickBooks Self-Employed which is part of our QuickBooks Online lineup as \u2013 and is included on the QuickBooks Online Subscriber line on the fact sheet. We had approximately 4,000 QuickBooks Self-Employed paying subscribers at the end of the second quarter. We\u2019ll continue to call out the growth of this subscriber base over the next few quarters. Moving to the desktop ecosystem, QuickBooks desktop units declined 26% in the second quarter as we continue to emphasize QuickBooks Online. More than 80% of our new QuickBooks Online customers are new to QuickBooks rather than migrating from desktop. Within the consumer group, consumer tax revenue was up 54% versus the second quarter last year as we benefited from an earlier start to the tax season this year. As you may recall, last year IRS opened e-file on January 31, pushing revenue into our third fiscal quarter, so this year we\u2019re returning to a more normal seasonal pattern. Our strong unit growth today benefited from our Absolute Zero Promotion, and our paid mix was also a bit better than we expected. In the back half, we face a tougher compare, but we still expect units to grow faster than revenue for the season. ProTax revenue was $11 million, down 69%. As we previously discussed, we expect a revenue shift of $150 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 due to changes in our desktop offerings. To help with your modeling, we expect ProTax revenue of about $125 million in the third quarter of 2015 and about $100 million in the fourth quarter. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. With approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. We also look for inorganic opportunities, and in the second quarter, we competed two acquisitions, bring us to a total of four transaction so far this fiscal year, totaling approximately $90 million. We\u2019ve also repurchased $555 million of shares in the second quarter with about 1.2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We intend to be in the market consistently during the year. Our board approved a $0.25 per share dividend for our fiscal third quarter, payable on April 20th. This represents a 32% increase versus last year and reflects our large and growing cash position as well as more recurring and predictable revenue streams. Looking ahead, we have reiterated our financial guidance and raised our QuickBooks Online subscriber guidance for fiscal 2015. We also provided guidance for the third and fourth quarters and you\u2019ll find our guidance details in the press release and on our fact sheet. As a reminder, we will provide our next tax unit update in April, soon after the tax season ends. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith : All right, thanks Neil. I know we\u2019ve taken sometime here to cover a lot of turf, but I hope it\u2019s been helpful context in advance of your questions. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us and at the end of the day, it all comes down to great people and I like what I see in our company\u2019s culture and in our employees. It is truly my privilege to be able to serve alongside them each everyday. So with that, let\u2019s open it up to you to hear what\u2019s on your mind, Sayeed? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. Brad, on the tax side, you mentioned the conversion rate went up year-over-year. I\u2019m just curious if you could give everyone a sense of what that conversion rate is today and what do you think you can do to continue to drive those conversion rates going forward? Brad Smith : Yes, Brent, thanks for the question. First of all, we would like to wait till the end of season and then at Investor Day we will share with you the year-over-year comparison and conversion rates and one of the reasons we want to do that is we\u2019re getting better every week. One of the things I mentioned in the opening remarks is the responsive experience, which is our ability to actually look at the kinds of information that we can see in your tax return and compared to others like you and truly streamline the interview process. And so that\u2019s enabling us to get more conversion out of people who are coming in and starting to return and getting them all the way through the end where they actually hit the send button. The other thing that we\u2019re able to do here is we\u2019re looking for areas where there were historical problems with entering data and then with the electronic import capabilities that we continue to advance. We\u2019re getting a lot of that work done for you so reduces friction and it is a combination of those things, which we call the taxes are done, which is really improving our conversion and I will tell you the teams truly are making improvement week over week and we will see how we finish up the season. Brent Thill : Great. And just real quick for Neil, given some of the renewed focused on the cyber issues that are going on in the industry, there is certainly been a lot more investments that the companies have been having to make to protect themselves. I would assume given you haven\u2019t changed the year on the bottom line that many of these increased investments around the cyber trend there are included in your guidance? Brad Smith : Yes, Brent, clearly that is a very important issue for us and so we are providing all the funding that we need in those areas. Anything that was not included in our guidance for the full year, we expect to reallocate from other investment opportunities within the company. So we have given a lot of thought and consideration, before we reiterated guidance for the full year. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Dunham, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Greg Dunham : Hi, yes. Thanks for taking my question. One more on tax, I mean clearly the numbers surprised as to the upset, especially given some of the bad press that we\u2019ve seen in the market. Can you talk to whether or not that actually has been head wind to the business? And if it has what has more than offset that you mentioned conversion. But what are some of the other areas or we are just assuming that the headwind on some of the bad press is just overblown? Thanks. Brad Smith : Well, Greg, first of all we are not Hollywood and so unlike Hollywood for all PR is good PR. We certainly don\u2019t like to have negative press out there about our product or have any of our customers frustrated. I think the first piece is the desktop lineup changes, we knew we made a mistake when we started hearing the feedback from the customers. But it\u2019s important to understand that affected 3% of our TurboTax customers. So while the noise was out there and the press coverage was pretty strong, it really wasn\u2019t a significant number of customers. And we worked really hard to get in touch with each and every one of them and to they make it right. And so I\u2019d say first of all the scope of that wasn\u2019t a significant as the press may have played it out to be. But from our perspective we took it very seriously, because every customer matters. And the second is on the industry-wide threat of cyber fraud attacking U.S tax system. This has been an industry-wide challenge. It is not a company specific challenge, despite some of the early press clippings, whether you look at our own competitors issuing open letters from their CEO and major newspapers. Or you know the IRS has been working with the industry since 2012 to solve this or even the state of Montana issuing in some press release last week, saying, hey this is happening to more than one company. I think most people understand that we are progresses, we are applying the most advanced techniques and at the end of the day they trust into it that we are going to process their information and protect the privacy and security. So I think the important thing here is the issue of cyber fraud is a threat to the tax system. We\u2019re one of the many players that want to be a part of the solution, but you have to separate the signal from the noise. The press is not representative of what we\u2019re seeing and as a result I think what you\u2019re actually seeing in our business results, our customers trust our brand, our product is even much better than it was last year, so we\u2019re improving conversion and that plays out in the marker place and that\u2019s why you see stronger tax results then maybe what the press might may have led you to believe. Greg Dunham : Great, thanks Brad. Brad Smith : All right. Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Walter Pritchard : Thanks, Brad, I\u2019m wondering on the \u2013 you had a nice acceleration in the QuickBooks Online subscribers and you added about 100,000 in your guidance for the third quarter actually assumes you fewer than 100,000. If I look at prior desktop seasonality, back when it was a pure desktop business, you\u2019d actually see a nice pickup from Q2 to Q3 in terms of subs. I\u2019m just wondering is the seasonality change or is there some factor that you think drove Q2 that is a repeatable as we look into Q3 for sub adds. Brad Smith : We know that each of our businesses do have cycles to them and in small business we do see a larger group of people buying heading into the New Year. And then it tends to tail off a little bit into the latter half of that, our fiscal year, so heading into the spring and summer. The desktop will throw you a little bit out of whack there QBO was more of a realtime consideration and you have a mix today of more service based businesses, because we\u2019re still building out advanced inventory to the mix of the kind of customer and QBO is slightly different than desktop. But right now what you are going to see is \u2013 we\u2019re still in the early learnings of just how big QBO will be in each of the quarters. This is our best forecast for the fourth quarter and it really reflects the slightly nuance differences and the service based customers in QBO versus more inventory based in desktop and the second is there is a seasonal pattern to win the peak periods are for QBO, just like there is and some of our other businesses. Walter Pritchard : And just Brad, a follow up on that. So you given a number I think out of fiscal 2017 of two million subscribers and you talked about \u2013 about two thirds I\u2019m sorry three quarters of those coming in though new customers and I\u2019m wondering if what you learned in the second quarter especially on that last part the mix of customers coming in new versus installed based conversion, if there is any change in your view in terms of the long-term? Brad Smith : At this time Walter, we\u2019re not changing that long-term view, that two million subs, our aspiration is not only to meet that but to exceed it. We\u2019re continuing to see strength in new to the franchise customers and this particular quarter 80% of QBO customers were new to the franchise; about 20% were migrators from desktop. We\u2019re doing everything we can to get desktop customers comfortable, we\u2019re adding that advanced inventory capability, or continuing to finish off things like job casting, we\u2019re running promotion, but as you learned from the TurboTax desktop experience I just walked through. Some of these customers aren\u2019t going to be move in anytime soon and we\u2019re fine with that, what we really like to see is we\u2019re expanding the category, we\u2019re getting new people into accounting software that never even used our product before. So right now, we are locked in on that 2 million number. And we just raised our forecast on subs this year. So we are not moving that 2 million yet. But if we continue to close in the way we are, we\u2019ll talk to you about that in the future. Walter Pritchard : Great. Thank you very much. Brad Smith : All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi Brad, you mentioned the ACA was not causing TurboTax users to leave to tax prep. I think the bigger concern that I hear from investors is whether you install to share shift in DIY. Given your prepared remarks it sounds like that is not the case I\u2019m kind of curious if that just where we are in this part of the tax season and maybe that changes or is there something that you\u2019re seeing that the ACA just isn\u2019t having any impact on that, kind of category shift. Brad Smith : Sterling, it\u2019s a fair question. And I think it\u2019s still out there for many to think through. Our assertion from early on if you look to what happened in Massachusetts back in the days when Romney was governor. There was no shift between tax prep methods when a light program was introduced at the state level so our hypothesis was if we do our job, and we take the complexity and make it simple. This should not be a catalyst to the assisted category. And we worked really hard to do that. I think, the second thing is, we do know that as you go further end of season, you will see the assisted tax prep methods start to pickup a little bit as more complex returns get processed. But right now, this is about where we were this time last year with the assisted category growth through February 6 reported by IRS and then also where the DIY category was. And at the end of the season, the DIY category picked up a little bit of share. So I believe we are going to see the same thing happen this year. My last point I would say is, we anticipated, if there was going to be a big impact that ACA would impact earlier in the season. Because when you look at those, you don\u2019t tend to have health insurance, there are often times those families that are living paycheck to paycheck they need to file early to get their refund. And the fact we haven\u2019t seen the kind of shift that some of the industry we\u2019re suggesting was going to happen, leads us to believe that our original hypothesis looks like it\u2019s going to play out. We don\u2019t expect this to be a catalyst. But we also were prepared to respond if anything changes based upon that, the balance of the season. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then just one follow-up and you touched upon in your answer there. Can you help us understand given the timing differences on when returns are starting to be accepted et cetera. We end up with a lot of numbers over different periods of time. So lot of apples and oranges kind of reiterate for us what you think the tax season growth will be for the tax business? And kind of what the results that you just reported meanings in terms of hitting those goals? Brad Smith : Yes, Sterling. Also two things here IRS data through February 6, reported the category the self prep DIY category, digital category with that seven and system is down four. If I take our numbers and right now we reported the February 14th, if I move them back and make them apples-to-apples, the number of e-filed returns we submitted through the same date the IRS put their data out, we\u2019re up 13%. So right after that, you can just do the math and say, okay, we\u2019re growing 13, the categories growing 7, it looks like TurboTax is picking up some share. And that\u2019s kind of where we were last year too. If you step back and look at our assumptions for the full season, our forecast were based upon the IRS total returns growing about 1% and right now that\u2019s what the IRS has reported so far through February 6. The second as we anticipated that the do-it-yourself category would pick up about a point of share out of the total returns filed. Right now through the results of February 6th, it\u2019s up almost 3 points. So it\u2019s a little bit higher than that, but we know it works through the balance of the season, it does start to shift a little more to assisted, so that'll come down a little bit if history plays out. The third lever we assumed is that we would pick up share and so far the data suggest that we picked up several points of share, but we also know we came off of a very exciting program called Absolute Zero. So we\u2019re going to say if we can hold our ground for the balance of the season and the last pieces revenue per return. We fully expect the customer growth will outpace revenues. We don\u2019t expect that to be a big catalyst and that adds up to the 5% to 7% total guidance we gave for consumer tax. I know there is a lot in there, but I hope that parse the numbers out and gave you apples-to-apples of us versus the IRS and then what our assumptions were. Sterling Auty : That was perfect. Thank you guys. Brad Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ross MacMillan : Thanks a lot. I have two, so first on consumer tax, a lot of price changes this year across the portfolio. And Brad you\u2019ve said a couple of times, you expect units to grow faster than price,. But by my math so far this season it looks like revenue per unit is a bit higher than last year and I\u2019m a little surprised that just because you\u2019ve obviously got the Absolute Zero program going on. Any comments on that \u2013 is my math right and any thoughts around that so far? Brad Smith : Ross, your math is right. As Neil was going through his opening comments, he said not only we have an exciting program with Absolute Zero, but our actual paid mix is higher than we had forecasted. A part of that is driven by the complexity base lineup we move to last year where we were trying to help customer to get into the right product. And so in TurboTax Online that\u2019s actually helped us to get customers to the right product. And as a result our paid mix is healthier. People are getting to the Deluxe and the Premier versions of the product, which is where they should have been all along. And that\u2019s one. Another one is just simply conversion and attach as we continue to make it more seamless and you\u2019re able to find services that are important to you. We\u2019re able to make that mix healthier as well. So those two things are adding to slightly higher revenue per return at this point in the season, but as you know, we still got about 60% of the season yet to go. And so we\u2019re going to see how the ultimate assumptions play out when we\u2019re done on April 15. Ross MacMillan : That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the small business side obviously with the introduction of self-employed and as you are pushing into international markets, there going to be quite different dynamics around ARPU or revenue per subscriber. Just from a big picture standpoint, how would you have us think about that as we progressed through this transition because I think right now you still got that ARR number on small business online ecosystem growing at a pretty nice clip. Brad Smith : Yes, Ross, I want to let Neil take that. I want to Batman to have a chance to speak here. I tend to halt the airways, so we\u2019ll turn it to Neil on this one. Neil Williams : Yes, so you\u2019re right Ross. I mean as you look at the self-employed product rolling out and products growing globally where we have less attach opportunities, you\u2019re going to see the ASP be slightly coming down for QuickBooks Online ecosystem overall. We modeled all that in to the lifetime value equation we shared with you back at Investor Day and we\u2019ll update as we get in at the end of this year. We\u2019re closely monitoring how different things are impacting that as you heard us talk about on the call today. We like what\u2019s happening with the tax particularly in the U.S. We made some acquisitions that will help us get to payroll faster outside the U.S., which will help those assumptions. And we\u2019re waiting to see how well we do with the self-employed product that we\u2019re excited about this point, but it\u2019s still very early days. So the short answer to your question is that the lifetime value equation that we gave you back in Investor Day last year is still good at this point and we\u2019re assessing as we go through each quarter the puts and takes and we\u2019ll update that for you at the end of the year and kind of show you how it migrates from one to the other, but look for higher attach rates in the U.S. improved retention to mitigate some of the downward pressure you would see outside the U.S. where you don\u2019t have the same attach opportunities and our product like QuickBooks Self-Employed, which clearly has a lower ASP and lower attach opportunity more likely than the traditional QBO product. Ross MacMillan : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hi, Brad and Neil. Brad, you talked about your desktop customers about 3% being impacted by the changes. So do you think the decline you saw in desktop 7% is the majority of that just people transitioning to online? Or I guess how would you parse out kind of the changes and then clients impacted versus transitioning to online? Brad Smith : You know, Kartik, if you look at the last five years of TurboTax desktop, the average has been a 3% decline, but two of those five years, the desktop was actually down about 6%. So it\u2019s happen to be the two years where there\u2019s a delayed opening to tax season, so it ramps up a little bit later. But I would tell you our 7% decline season today is reflective of just an ongoing secular trend that people moving out to desktop to the cloud and it\u2019s probably in that 3% to 4% range and the rest of it honestly I think was just the result of us having made a bad decision on a desktop line-up and we\u2019re going to have to work hard to earn those customers back. And so that\u2019s the truth of it about half of it is secular shift to the cloud and the other half is a self-inflicted wound that we're going to fight for and try to get those customers back. Kartik Mehta : And Brad on the QBO side you said \u2013 I believe you said 80% are new to the system. As you look at those customers, are they new businesses or they existing businesses that are now switching over to QBO? Brad Smith : It\u2019s a combination of both. New to the world businesses are finding it a lot easier to come in now and get up and running from any device they want to use including a tablet or a phone. And the other our existing businesses that historically have been using Excel spreadsheets. And so, it\u2019s really a mix of complete new to the world and then those are new to the category. Kartik Mehta : And just one last question, Brad. Have you seen a change at all in your cost to acquire QBO clients based on the type of customers you\u2019re getting and maybe if you see another competition out there? Brad Smith : We continue to see an improvement in our cost to acquire customers. As the accountants are getting more comfortable with QBO, the new re-imagined version, they\u2019re recommending it and of course that recommendation leads to a faster, yes, from the small business side. We\u2019re also getting better SCO and SEM and so ultimately our direct channels are more efficient and our account referrals are building [indiscernible]. And outside of the U.S. as were in each of the countries we are in brand building mode so the cost of acquire is more expensive in those countries but on a quarter by quarter basis, we\u2019re seeing the efficiency come in there as well. So you put it all together and our cost to acquire is getting more efficient regardless of the competitive dynamic in any of those countries. Kartik Mehta : Thank you very much, Brad. I appreciate it. Brad Smith : All right, thank you Kartik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open, please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to stay on QBO. You have seen an acceleration of subscribers \u2013 of subscriber growth ever since you launched in your harmony of product. And how do you think about where that is going to max out what are the puts and takes to say like okay 50% of something, we think it\u2019s good or can it go to 60% or 70%. I mean just \u2013 you know at some point, we\u2019re going to hit kind of a number where you won\u2019t accelerate and I just want to kind of be ready for that. And then also can you talk a little bit about the international business in terms of what are the stronger \u2013 which countries did you like and where the performance could have been better? Thank you. Brad Smith : You\u2019re welcome. I wish that I had answer for your first one. I\u2019d like to know when that\u2019s going to max out too, not because I am anxious to get there, but I just want to see if we can blow past. You touched on it. We\u2019ve had half dozen quarters here. Now, we\u2019re continuing to accelerate quarter over quarter and we\u2019re feeling very good about the trajectory. So right now, I can\u2019t tell you that we\u2019ve got a flat line that we drawn out because we think we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity ahead of us as we\u2019re expanding the category, I wish that could be more helpful on that one. At global markets right now, with the acquisition we just made of ZeroPaper in Brazil that takes us into a new country that is now our sixth country, so we have Canada, the UK, Australia and India, before we\u2019ve been talking to you about historically. We mentioned at Investor Day, we were doing a Greenfield launch in France and now with the acquisition of ZeroPaper in Brazil. In terms of the country, these one have had different characteristics. The Canada business is rocking and rolling. It continues to grow more profitable. As we look at the UK that is a very competitive market right now with many players over there, some established, some new. We continue to accelerate our quarter-over-quarter performance, but we still have work ahead of us to get into the number one position in that market. In Australia, of course, that is \u2013 somebody else\u2019s home court. And so we\u2019re there in an aggressive fashion to show that we can play in the most contested battlefield there is. And so far that has been our fastest growing market \u2013 by the fact you would expect that to be in the place where we\u2019d have the most hostile environment. India is Greenfield. We\u2019re truly creating the cloud category there because almost everyone there is desktop and quite frankly many of the products have a DOS like feel to them. And so we\u2019re currently trying to create the category and get people comfortable at the cloud in India. France and Brazil are going to be our newest entries and right now we\u2019re in the early learning phases there. One we\u2019re doing organically, where we\u2019re taking QBO and we\u2019re literally localizing it and then rolling out in the market and in Brazil we\u2019re doing it inorganically with ZeroPaper. And so each of the countries has a different set of characteristics. You put them all together and we\u2019re growing 170% and we\u2019re felling very good about our global trajectory and the fact is that we\u2019re getting more efficient than our cost of acquire each and every quarter. Raimo Lenschow : Alright, thank you. Brad Smith : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Great, thanks for taking my question. Brad turning back the clock to February 6th on tax, it\u2019s nice to see you\u2019re taking share based on that 30% growth in returns that you have shared. Do you have any insight or thoughts on where the shares is coming from even just broadly weather from the larger or smaller competitors? Brad Smith : You know Brad, we really don\u2019t at this point. None of our competitors as well tax act did report as a part of Blucora, but there wasn\u2019t a lot of data that was shared there. They kind of reiterated their guidance for the season. The other major competitor is not going to be reporting until I think March. And so once they get their data out there and then we have [indiscernible], we\u2019ll be able to have a better way to triangulate, but today I would tell you \u2013 it was just be speculation on my part. Brad Zelnick : Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. If I could follow-up with one more on the change in new QBO payroll attach, going from an opt-out to an opt-in model. Could you maybe just give us a little more color why the change and talk about the impact of the bigger picture? Brad Smith : Yes, sure. I can Brad. What we try to do is, make it very seamless for you to come in sign up for QBO and have payroll included. What ended up happening is a portion of customers would come in and they would find in their first bill that they were paying for payroll. And in many cases, they didn\u2019t have a need for payroll, if they didn\u2019t have employees or they were using in other service and it became a point of frustration for them, they would drop customer care calls or in many cases they would just cancel their subscription. And so what we realized was, we weren\u2019t clear enough and it was confusing. So instead, what we done is, we move to an opt-in model. We\u2019re based upon certain moments in needs, you\u2019re adding an employer, and you\u2019re going into the employee tab we are able to basically make it more elegant to say, hey, do you want to have this payroll service. What we are seeing right now is, we\u2019ve got cohort analysis and we are actually seeing an improvement in our retention. The couple of 100 basis points, and that\u2019s one of the biggest leverage you have in a subscription business is improving your retention. And while we\u2019re taking a step back because I think we had a false positive when we were out there in that 30% range of attach. We\u2019ve taken a step back into the lower 20s. We\u2019re actually improving the retention and we think that\u2019s going to add up to a much healthier franchise over the long-term. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much. Brad Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Gil Luria : Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask about the impact of the true zero promotion. Have you seen a higher percentage of your online TurboTax filers in the promotion versus last year. If I\u2019m not mistaken, the promotion lasted a couple of weeks longer this year. And in obviously went down from $15 to true zero, of the $15.2 million TurboTax Online use of this year was a higher proportion \u2013 in this proportion within the promotion versus of $13.6 million from last year. Brad Smith : Gil, the answer is more than last year. But the paid mix is healthier than we had forecasted. So we actually got the best of both worlds. I was looking at the analysis \u2013 Neil and I sat down with tax team on a regular basis as you might imagine free tax season and they are showing us the source of the new customers. And the two biggest franchise year-over-year, which are really encouraging, our first time filers people who never filed tax returns before, and then first time moving into the category. And those are basically both saying we are expanding the DIY category of this kind of offering. And so I think this is really exciting for us because we know we can get a customer in the franchise and we can actually monetize them and grow the lifetime value if their tax situation becomes more complex. So right now, we are seeing not only a better \u2013 a conversion than last year in terms of people coming on the promotion but our paid mix is healthier than we thought as well. Gil Luria : Got it. And then on the \u2013 in the fraud situations did you find that those customers that were affected by fraud that somebody else filed under their information that the attrition there was higher than the rest of population was that a significant factor? Brad Smith : It wasn\u2019t and I tell you why first of all I want to make sure that I will clear in the opening comments that the headline here is our customers know they can trust Intuit. There is nothing we take more sacred in the privacy and security of their data and two things are fact today one is we\u2019re up and running and processing returns in the federal and all the states and the second is there is no breach of Intuit systems. And that is not only the result of our own analysis but outside third-parties have coming in and run all their diagnostics with us. And we\u2019ve reached that conclusion I think with the customers the thing that they appreciate if they\u2019ve actually been the victim of having their ID stolen from one of these other high-profile sources that we\u2019re all reading about in the newspaper. And in fact last week in Stanford University I tend to the Cybersecurity Summit with President Obama and others. Over 100 million identities have been stolen in the last 12 months that\u2019s people walking around with somebody else\u2019s Social Security Number and they were attacking the U.S. tax system and trying to file these returns, and so customers understand that this is broader and what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re helping them navigate the process we\u2019re getting them access the agents who can help them get their filing done for them. And so it\u2019s not causing an attrition issue because they recognize this is in a particular product issue this is a systemwide problem and they were appreciating the help. So we have not seeing an increase in attrition due to that particular issue. Gil Luria : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Brad Smith : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan : Hi, thanks for my question. Brad with respect to the new user attach rates I know you mentioned that due to a different changing with \u2013 different methodology the numbers looking little different. But can you talk to how this trajectory should continue so as to enable you to hit or exceed your goals for the long-term are we looking at a hockey stick type trajectory or do you think that the trends so far a more normal progression towards the attach of payroll and payment. So you can hit your ARR objectives longer term? Brad Smith : Yes, Kash, we do see a continuation of a normalized attach rate we put in our prepared remarks that our payroll and QuickBooks Online we anticipate will be in the low 20s in the next few quarters. We see that moving up into a healthier mid 20s and beyond as we get pass the next few quarters. But we also see a corresponding offset which is an improvement in retention. And as a combination of those things that will drive lifetime value when we step back and we look at the payroll and the payment attach rates for new users in QBO and then you look at the penetration opportunity against the base. We really do see opportunity ahead of us and we continue to see that increasing and improving quarter-over-quarter. So aside from these next few quarters of payroll as we have to grow over this opt-in, opt-out saying we do see a continuation of strengthening attach rates for our payroll and payments products which lead to that lifetime value assumption we\u2019ll share with you at Investor Day. Kash Rangan : Got it. With respect to the desktop QB product are there any plans to at least curtail development offer if not curtail selling of it completely and going to a maintenance mode at this point so we can get the customer base to slowly shift to the online? Brad Smith : I was born at night but not last night and coming off of the TurboTax desktop challenge that we just had I\u2019ve learned a pretty important lesson there which these customers are happy with their product we have committed to making sure that if they want to stay on the desktop we\u2019re going to support them for as long as they want to use that product. But we\u2019re going to make it really enticing for them to get to the cloud but we have zero plans to sense of the product or to do anything that will upset them and make them decide to shop someplace else. And I didn\u2019t mean to be flip I meant to be self critical which has make a lot of mistake that\u2019s okay make two mistakes and somebody ought to slam my hand in a door. Kash Rangan : I appreciate the candor and finally maybe I missed this about six months back. Did you share an ARR goal for the online business longer term fiscal 2017 or 2018 and if you did I look at it but if you didn\u2019t I would love to hear your thoughts on that. Thank you. Brad Smith : No, we did not Kash, we shared an outlook for company revenue which fairly is the QuickBooks Online revenues of portion that we did not get more specificity around the overall revenue guidance number. Kash Rangan : Okay got it. thanks a lot guys. Brad Smith : .: Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Macdonald from First Analysis. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jim Macdonald : Hi, Good afternoon, guys. Brad Smith : Hi, Jim Jim Macdonald : Hey, looking at the February 14th tax dated at that point do you think the impact of a delayed filing last year versus this year is washed out and then I don\u2019t know if you can quantify the effect of your Absolute Zero program do you think in that data? Brad Smith : Yes, Jim, our assumption is that the effect of that delayed filing last year and where we\u2019re now its pretty much washed out at this point. We\u2019ll have to see full season how everything shakes out but that\u2019s definitely what we\u2019re operating from in terms of the Absolute Zero promotion we like the results so far we\u2019re going to wait till the end of the tax season and we\u2019ll look back and say did it achieve everything we thought it would. But so far the early data suggesting very positive for us and we like the impact of the new franchise new to the world filers coming in we like the fact people are moving into the category for the first time. We like the fact that the categories expanded and also that looks like we picked up a couple points of share and all of that was still improving our paid mix. So far, so good, but we want to wait for the full season effect to see, ultimately what the impact was. Jim Macdonald : Great and then \u2013 down in Brazil on ZeroPaper. What are your plans about using their product versus \u2013 will their product become effectively QuickBooks Online down there. What are your thoughts on how that will work in Brazil? Brad Smith : Yes, Jim, Brazil is a unique market they have those notion of something called [indiscernible] and it\u2019s sort of like an invoice here, the payment methodology and then you can convert that invoice into cash and that\u2019s was ZeroPaper has done, it\u2019s really for what we\u2019re doing here with QuickBooks Self-Employed it does micro businesses, but down there it\u2019s a tool that micro businesses need to do to basically get paid. And so what we\u2019re going to be doing is taking the product and then importing it over on to the QBO platform and think of it in Brazil becoming the entry level skew and then eventually that will lead out to our more main line QuickBooks Online product. So it will remain in market, it is a Brazil specific product, but that\u2019s a rapidly growing economy with a lot of opportunity and we\u2019re going to put it on our platforms, you can naturally unlock and grow into QBO overtime. Jim Macdonald : Great, thanks. Brad Smith : Alright, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer, your line is open. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks Steve and Brad. Just curious on the desktop, the pricing change obviously didn\u2019t go as you had planned and that was one of the things that was probably going to subsidize Absolute Zero. I\u2019m just curious you guys have obviously reiterated the revenue guidance for consumer tax. So I\u2019m curious Brad how confident are you at this juncture of the year, we know it affected 3% of TurboTax customers and we saw our volume impact. But just on revenue per return, obviously you have a lot of moving pieces, so was that a headwind and you mentioned earlier some positives on revenue per return. Could you just compare and contrast these at this juncture. Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes Scott, so we\u2019ve seen some puts and takes so far in the season. The take was we reversed our decision and we\u2019ve give the customers the upgrade for free and that does account for some revenue that we would have originally had in our forecast, the flip of that is at Neil said even with that absolute zero we\u2019ve had a healthier paid mix than what we had in our forecast. So when you put it on the blender, it\u2019s comes out to us having the confidence to sit with you today and based on what we see reiterate our guidance for the full year. And I think it\u2019s really just the combination of all these things. Scott Schneeberger : Great thanks and then a following-up with regard to strategy and I guess we have to see at this year completes but just on going to free state with free federal. Is that something you feel that you can reverse out in the future or now that you\u2019re there, is it something that you think is a permanent thing? Brad Smith : Well, we\u2019ll certainly take a look at how the program played out at the end of the season and if it\u2019s an effective program, then you will see us continuing to do things that we think makes sense for customers and makes sense for our strategic goals which is growing the category and our share. If it\u2019s not a successful program, we have found that you can make the kind of changes and those kinds of promotions year-over-year and customers understand. So at this time point it\u2019s pretty premature for us to speculate what's going to happen with that absolute zero next year next year, but so far we like the results given where we\u2019re in the season. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks very much. Brad Smith : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jennifer Lowe : Great, thank you. Brad I wanted to touch on some of the longer term targets around QuickBooks Online subscribers specifically the increased guidance for this year and then the targets for 2017 and if you look at those I\u2019m curious how you think about those in terms of where the business is today with 80% coming in as new to the QuickBooks\u2019 franchise, versus what your expectations within those projections are around desktop conversions or potentially future contribution from the self-employed product? Brad Smith : Yes. So Jennifer this is as we\u2019re sitting here and speaking we\u2019re looking at the assumptions we had and then what\u2019s playing out in the market there hasn\u2019t been anything that\u2019s fundamentally different, I\u2019ll give you a couple of tweaks. One is the product is continuing to perform in a way that we\u2019re delighted by, its expanding the category and getting first time small businesses, as well as people here are new to the accounting software category in. So we originally had assumed that we will have a slightly larger portion of desktop moderator is going to the file, that number is nice at that level that we thought but we're getting more new to the franchise customers. And so the number hasn\u2019t changed the mix has. And the other thing is QBSE QuickBooks Self-Employed this is new for us and we\u2019re looking to make it a global product. Right now, we don\u2019t count those customers in QBO, if they aren\u2019t paid subs. And we do have deals with Lyft and Uber and other that we mentioned that today is a free QuickBooks Self-Employed but then ultimate the way we monetize and if you want to send that into TurboTax we have an attach rate that this shows up in a different business unit called TurboTax. So it\u2019s a nice little one Intuit ecosystem in place. We\u2019ll see as QBSE growth and becomes more meaningful as it part of the paid subscribers we\u2019ll wholly break out so you can see it. But right now, it\u2019s only about 4000 of the total number of subs so it\u2019s pretty immaterial. So you put all that together, we\u2019re hoping that we\u2019re going to get more and more desktop customers excited about the cloud if not we still feel good about our two million subs because we\u2019re getting more people into the franchise more than we had anticipated with the new QuickBooks Online. Jennifer Lowe : Great. And maybe just a follow-up one quick additional question, when you talked about where those 80% are coming from you highlighted new businesses, you highlighted customers coming off of Excel. But curious if you\u2019re seeing customers coming off of competing small business accounting solutions that might have not chosen to go with QuickBooks in the past, given the more limited online offerings that might be making different competitive decisions today. Brad Smith : Well, in the U.S. and I know that everyone on the call is familiar with this. We are primarily the player in the U.S. with QuickBooks desktop. The share is over 90% then you\u2019ve got a couple of other players. The online players are relatively new in the United States. So if we were to actually growing the category, the read and do businesses that is started because the economy is getting healthy, there are part of 40% that is still in Excel spreadsheets. And so that\u2019s really the opportunity there. Outside the U.S. and other countries we are able to convert some customers away from some of the competitive products. But we are also getting an influx of people coming off spreadsheet there too. But the mix is a little more \u2013 its more people coming from competitors and what you would see in the U.S., but by and large a lot of them are still new businesses and Excel spreadsheets. Jennifer Lowe : Thank you. Brad Smith : All right. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Millman from Millman Research. Your line is open, please go ahead. Michael Millman : Thank you. Looking at fraud on online, can you talk a little more about the EITC fraud, which I guess has been ongoing and certainly block has been doing battle with that and got to move from Congress. And then secondly, and related to tax, can you talk about whether you\u2019re seeing changes in lifetime value for the tax systems depended upon \u2013 or at least over the several years as you move more and more starting with zero or absolute zero currently. Thank you. Brad Smith : Hi, Mike. So on EITC, yes, I\u2019m aware that our collected industry peers are all standing shoulder-to-shoulder and working with the government to try to take on the cyber fraud. And everyone has seen a different side of the animal and I know in our particular case the competitor you just mentioned, they are out there talking about two particular things, the need for license professionals and to keep an eye on earned income tax credit where they the observed some patterns that have been nervous as you might imagine we have algorithms and data we look at in our own. We produce this suspicious activity report and we have since 2012 that we provide to the IRS on anything that we see that may be unusual and then the IRS is the ultimate legal entity that determines whether that is a legitimate or a fraudulent return. And so as we look at our EITC data in the context of that, we\u2019re seeing right now, that the growth of the EITC this year season-to-date is inline with our units. And we don\u2019t see that particular category sticking out as any more suspicious in our mix today than any of the other variables we look at. But that is not to say that there is something that everyone in the industry have to keep an eye on, we just haven\u2019t seen that particular pattern emerge in out own customer base. Michael Millman : Have you seen a change in that over the last three or four years? Brad Smith : Have we seen a change in the IT\u2019s - I\u2019m sorry can you just be lot more specific Mike? Michael Millman : Percentage of filers using EITC are collecting on it. Brad Smith : You know Mike I honestly can\u2019t answer that question. I just don\u2019t know that data of the top of my head. So I unfortunately I can\u2019t answer the question. I apologize for that. And you have a second question which was the lifetime value piece. As you saw last year our revenue per return was down slightly as we grow our units and we grow our units faster than our revenue and ultimately our strategic goal is to expand the self-prepared category and then grow our share and we said that we would love every year and a half units grow faster than revenue because we know overtime the last ten values going to improve. The answer to your question about the individual tax payer are we seeing improved LTV? We are. But when you put it in an aggregated mix, you got a bunch of new people coming in they\u2019re coming in at first year and absolute zero, it does inflate the revenue per return on an average. But what we saw last year moving to TurboTax Online with this new line up, we\u2019re getting a healthier mix, have paid. I think that\u2019s where one of the question\u2019s earlier that cash or someone had asked, which is, is the assumption right, I think, revenue per return being a little healthier, the answer is yes, because on an individual tax return basis, we\u2019re actually seeing customers move up the move up the product line. So at an individual level the LTV is healthy, but in aggregate when you bring more new people in and they come in and their promotion price it\u2019s actually deflating the average. Michael Millman : Thank you Brad Smith : Alright, you\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you, gentlemen, that is all the time we have today for questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith : You know Saeed, I would. And I appreciate it\u2019s a little bit past our normal time and we were wanting to do that, because we want to make sure we regard to everyone\u2019s question. So let me just wrap up time, we want to thank everybody for your patience today. I know our opening remarks were a bit longer than usual, but we wanted to give you as much context as we could around the two recent events. If you could take anything away from this call, I hope that you heard that me, Neil, Matt and the others feel confident and where we are to the first half of the year and we\u2019re excited about momentum we\u2019re building in the back half. And with that I want to thank you for your questions and we\u2019ll look forward to catching up with you on the after calls. Take care everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s call. You may disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

My name is Syed and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. With that, now I'd like to turn the call over to Matt Rhodes, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Rhodes, you may begin. Matt Rhodes - Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate FP&A: Thank you, sir. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Intuit's third quarter fiscal 2015 conference call. I'm here with Brad Smith, our President and CEO, and Neil Williams, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad Smith. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Thank you, Matt, and thanks to all of you for joining us. First, the headlines. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $2.2 billion. This was above our guidance range and, as a result, we increased our full year revenue guidance. Non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share were also above guidance. QuickBooks Online subscribers once again exceeded expectations, so we've raised our outlook there for the fiscal year as well. Our GAAP results include the impact of a strategic refocus in our Consumer Ecosystem Group, which Neil will discuss in a moment. Now, I know the tax season is on everyone's mind, so let me start there. I feel very good about our performance in our tax businesses. In the U.S., season-to-date, TurboTax Online units grew 13% and total TurboTax units grew 9%, excluding the Free File Alliance. As a result, we now expect Consumer Tax revenue to grow about 9% for the fiscal year, above our previous guidance range of 5% to 7%. We're in the second year of a multi-year journey to deliver our strategic goal of taxes are done. Our objectives this year were to drive growth in the do-it-yourself software category, to increase our customer base, and to expand our market share. We succeeded on all fronts. As we shared in previous discussions, there are four main growth drivers for TurboTax. Let me walk through each of these and highlight how we performed versus our expectation. The first driver is the total number of returns filed with the IRS each year. Total returns received by the IRS were up about 1%, in line with our expectations. The second driver is the growth of the do-it-yourself software category and the category share of the total IRS returns filed. This season, the do-it-yourself software category gained more than 1 point of share from alternative methods, which was a little better than we had forecasted. As the category champion, it is our responsibility to help fuel the secular shift towards software that's been occurring for the past decade, and we succeeded. IRS data shows that the do-it-yourself e-files were up 6%, contrasted with assisted e-files which were roughly flat. Over the past two years, the do-it-yourself software category has gained 3 points a share from the assisted tax prep methods. The third driver is expanding our share within the do-it-yourself software category. This season, driven by the improvements in our TurboTax product and more efficient and effective marketing, we estimate that TurboTax Online gained about 1.5 points of share, which translates into 4 points of share gains over the past two seasons. While our Absolute Zero program helped drive share gains early in the season, the payoff on our multi-year product innovation had the greatest impact, as demonstrated by big improvements in Net Promoter Score, conversion and retention. And finally, the fourth driver is the monetization of those returns. Our share gains were not simply the result of aggressive promotion. The reality is that we delivered revenue above our guidance range even as we achieved our goal of growing our customer base faster than revenue. This was driven by stronger product mix, improved attach rates and a new bundle. Our efforts to reinvent the tax prep category are clearly paying off. TurboTax's mobile innovation enabled customers to start and finish their return on any device for the first time. Total mobile app downloads were up almost 70% year-over-year and the ability to finish on any device more than doubled conversion for those that started out on a mobile device. Our investment in the offering also led to a 30% decrease in overall customer support contracts throughout the season. During the heaviest cold days at the very end of season, we decreased our support abandonment rate by 80%. These durable innovations which have been developed over several years are not easily matched by competition and they've improved TurboTax Online's conversion by nearly 300 basis points this year and improved TurboTax Online's Net Promoter Score by 5 points as well. And we learned a lot this tax season and we demonstrated an ability to adapt quickly to the constantly evolving fraud threat. We've emerged a wiser organization with a game plan to win next season and beyond. We're committed to leading the industries fraud protection efforts and to earning the trust of our customers every single day. On the ProTax side of the business, total customers also grew, while the overall Pro category was roughly flat. This segment is on track to come in at the high-end of its guidance range as well. With that overview on tax, let me now shift to small business. The QuickBooks Online ecosystem continues to build momentum. We grew total QuickBooks Online subscribers by 55% in the third quarter, up from 50% in the previous quarter. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter of accelerating paid subscriber growth. We added more than 120,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers in the quarter and we now have 965,000 paying subscribers worldwide. In the U.S., QuickBooks Online subscriber growth accelerated, growing 45% in the quarter, up from 39% in the previous quarter. Our new customer payroll attach rate in the U.S. improved versus last quarter to 23%. And our QuickBooks Online payments attach rate of 9% is up from 8% a year ago. Roughly 15,000 of our QuickBooks Online subscribers are using the QuickBooks Self-Employed solution. That's up from 5,000 subscribers just 90 days ago. And about a third of those customers chose the bundle that includes TurboTax Home & Business. Finally, outside the U.S., QuickBooks Online subscribers were up about 140% to just over 150,000 paid subs. To put a bow around the year, in tax, we successfully navigated a challenging season, growing the category, gaining market share, and improving monetization efforts, all resulting from a multi-year effort in pursuit of our strategic goal of taxes are done. And our small business online ecosystem continues to build momentum with QuickBooks Online subscriber growth accelerating So with that overview, let met turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details. R. Neil Williams - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Brad. We'll start with overall company results. For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we delivered revenue of $2.2 billion, non-GAAP operating income of $1.2 billion, GAAP operating income of $906 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.85 and GAAP earnings per share of $1.78. These results factor in our strategic decision to deliver ongoing services and releases for future desktop offerings to encourage migration to online solutions. As a result, revenue for future desktop software licenses will be recognized as services are delivered, rather than upfront. Our GAAP results include a goodwill impairment charge for our Consumer Ecosystem Group. Our revenue and operating income for this group have trailed our expectations for the year. As a result, we initiated a strategic shift in the third quarter to increase our focus on integrating our bill pay solution into Mint and Quicken. Accelerating this capability was the primary reason for the Check acquisition last year. With this strategic shift, we're reducing our focus on Check's biller and direct pay channels. And as a result, we're writing off approximately $263 million in goodwill, primarily associated with these channels. This charge reduced third quarter GAAP earnings per share by $0.93. Turning to the business segments, total small business group revenue declined 5% for the third quarter, primarily due to the impact of changes to the QuickBooks Desktop product, resulting in ratable revenue recognition. QuickBooks total paying customers grew 20% in the third quarter and are up about 8% year-to-date. Small business online ecosystem revenue grew 20% and customer acquisition in our online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 55%, accelerating from last quarter. Online active payments customers grew 6% and Online Payments charge volume grew 19%, driven by an increase in charge volume per customer. Online Payroll customers grew 20%. Switching to desktop, total desktop ecosystem revenue declined 15% as expected. QuickBooks Desktop units declined 23% in the third quarter as we continue to emphasize QuickBooks Online. The strong acquisition of new customers in QuickBooks Online has more than offset the decline in desktop units. Desktop active payments customers declined 11% and desktop payments charge volume declined 1%. In the third quarter, we sold non-core payments assets, which had generated roughly $20 million in annual revenue. The goal of this transaction was to further focus on our core opportunities in the payment space attached to QuickBooks Online and e-invoicing across our ecosystem of more than 4 million small businesses. We recorded a gain on the sale of these assets of $30 million in the third quarter. Within the consumer group, Consumer Tax revenue was up 4% versus the third quarter last year and up 9% year-to-date as we benefited from a higher-than-expected mix of paid units and revenue from attached services. Free upgrades, rebates and higher attrition for customers affected by our desktop product changes reduced revenue by approximately $20 million. We also incurred an additional $15 million in expenses related to servicing customers impacted by the TurboTax Desktop lineup change and to increased investment in data and security features. We'll continue to invest in this area to ensure our customers' privacy and security. ProTax revenue was $130 million, down 61%. As we previously discussed, we expect a revenue shift of $150 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 due to changes in our desktop offerings. The fundamentals of this business remain strong and we expect full year revenue to be near the high-end of our guidance range. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15%. With approximately $2.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. We also look for inorganic opportunities and, in the third quarter, we made two acquisitions totaling approximately $30 million. When it's the best of use of cash, we'll return cash to shareholders via share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $1.25 billion of shares at an average price of about $90, including $568 million of shares in the third quarter. The board approved an additional $2 billion in share buyback authorization. We now have about $2.6 billion remaining on our authorization and we intend to be in the market each quarter. Our board also approved a $0.25 dividend per share for our fiscal fourth quarter, payable on July 20. This represents a 32% increase versus last year and reflects our large and growing cash position as well as more recurring and predictable revenue streams. We raised our revenue guidance for the full year and we maintained our operating income guidance despite increased investment primarily in Consumer Tax. We also raised our QuickBooks Online subscriber growth for the full year. You can find our guidance details in our press release and on the fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Thank you, Neil. We're pleased with our strong finish to the tax season. We grew the digital category, increased share and plan to come in above the high-end of our revenue guidance range in Consumer Tax. As we continue to re-imagine the tax preparation experience, we are already working on the product for next season. And we will remain at the forefront in the ongoing fight against fraud, working with our peers and government agencies to help protect tax payers. On the small business momentum side, it continues to build and ramp up and, as a result, our transition to the cloud is accelerating, driving value for customers and for Intuit. So with that, let's open it up to you to hear what's on your mind. Syed? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks. Two small business related questions. First, I saw you bumped up the guide for the year. You didn't comment on the 2 million number for fiscal 2017, and I'm wondering just given the outperformance here, the pace in which you're adding subs, how should we be thinking about that 2 million number that you're thinking out in 2017? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Walter. It's Brad. First of all, we've raised the guidance a couple of times this year, so clearly the question is on target. We continue to outpace our forecast. At the same time, what we want to do is, we want to close out this fiscal year and then pull up the nose of at plane and we'll take a look at our guidance for fiscal year 2016 in August as well as our outlook for 2017. At this point in time, we're not changing the outlook, but we clearly have a pattern here of continuing to perform well. So we'll talk to you more about that when we set guidance for 2016 and then talk to you at Investor Day in the fall. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And then Brad, just kind of related to that. So I think this fall, you're going to release your QuickBooks Desktop product again like you do every year. Except this year, there's really \u2013 my understanding is there's really not going to be any new features in the product or that substantially all of your feature development is on the online product. And now that you're getting closer to that and sort of maybe playing with how customers may behave around that, how should we think that impacts the growth rate of online given they'll go to the store and they'll see a new product, but there is really not a whole lot new in that desktop product, while all the new features are in the online? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So first of all, the statement's absolutely on target. We are leaning our new R&D and features into QuickBooks Online. At the same time, we remain committed to having a delightful product experience for desktop customers. We still have 3.7 million customers using that product. And while we do see some that are willing to migrate to the cloud, we want to keep those customers who stay on desktop delighted. We haven't talked about what features we'll put in there. The one thing we are continuing to do is improve the product experience so they can do things more efficiently and effectively. So there will be changes in the product that will continue to come out in the fall, but we will be leaning more heavily into the new features in QuickBooks Online. What that turns into in terms of an outlook is, we anticipate, as you can tell from our subscriber forecast, is you're going to see more new customers coming in to QuickBooks Online. In fact, right now, over 60% of all the new customers are now selecting the cloud version versus desktop. And it was just a few quarters ago, we hit 50/50. So we see that continuing and we expect desktop units will probably continue to decline at 20% to 25% and so those are sort of the outlooks we've provided so far. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks, Brad. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Brad, just on the international build out of the small business, I'm just curious if you could bring us up to speed in terms of what you're seeing there and the traction. And if you could also comment, I think you have a \u2013 obviously, a very big installed base on the desktop side and I think you've been pretty clear that a lot of the net new users to QuickBooks have come from new users rather than the installed base. So are you starting to see that installed base move over or when you look at that 2 million number, how much is predicated on those installed base customers moving over? Thank you. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome, Brent. So let me start with the global view. We continue to be encouraged by our global progress. We just announced that it was up again 140%. We have about 150,000 paid subs. On a country-by-country basis, the story is slightly different. There's real strength and momentum in Canada. There's a continuing acceleration in Australia as well as the United Kingdom. We have had some challenges with monetization efforts in India, but it's a very small portion of our base and we treat that as an experimentation market, because we truly are the only cloud-based player there. So we're learning more in the India market. But we're getting good subs. We're just trying to find different ways to make sure that we're bundling that with the right products for accountants. And of course, we just recently announced an acquisition in Brazil as well as opening up in France. And so as we head into the fall, we'll have a better read on how those two countries are performing, but so far we like how the product is shaping up and we like the reception in the market. So the global story is strong. When you think about the desktop and then the new users and the migration that you're asking about for QBO, right now, about eight out of 10 of the QuickBooks Online customers are new to the franchise. That's pretty consistent over the last several quarters. The migration is not as much as we had originally forecasted, but it's still up over 60% and so it's a good healthy migration number. But our goal right now is to make sure we have the right feature functionality in the online version, so for those who want to migrate we have that and we think we'll have most of that gap closed in this late summer timeframe. The second thing we want to make sure we do is that we have the data conversion and the assistance they may need up and running and we have that in place now. And then the third thing is, just make sure that they feel like it's a good cross value and we feel today that we're getting good feedback on that. After that, it's up to them being comfortable and if their accountant helps them make that jump, then I think we'll make the move. If not, we're going to keep them happy on the desktop, because if they don't want to leave the desktop product to go to our own cloud solution, we don't see them leaving to a competitor either and we want to keep them in the franchise. So that's sort of how we're looking at migrations right now. Eight out of 10 of the users in QBO are new to the franchise. The other 20% are actually migrating from desktop. That's a pretty consistent ratio, but we are seeing the migration numbers going up about 60%, but it's still not as big as we had originally forecast and we're fine with that. Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Oh, thanks. Brad or Neil, I was just curious, you commented that total QuickBooks users were up, I think, 20%. But if I look at on a unit basis and I think about what percentage you're actually capturing from conversion, it's still looks like the overall desktop units are falling a little bit faster than I would have expected. And I noticed you did some promotions, I think, in April to try to, I presume, convert some of the traditional QuickBooks Desktop customer to buy afresh. I was just curious as to kind of what your thoughts are there with respect to, if you will, capturing those desktop customers that are clearly tracking a little bit sort of lower than we typically see in terms of purchasing on that three-year cadence? R. Neil Williams - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi, Ross. This is Neil. You're exactly right. We have been watching the desktop sales quite aggressively and, as Brad mentioned, the migration story hasn't been quite as robust as we might have planned and included in our expectations. On the other hand, we don't see those desktop customers going anywhere else either. So, as you know, for those who've used our products, they can choose when they want to upgrade and when they choose to do that. We've tested different price points throughout this year to determine if we can influence what we call, eager upgraders; those people who upgrade their desktop solution more frequently than every three years and 36 months. And we've seen some encouraging signs more recently, but to the broader point, as we've said all along, we expect the desktop units to decline around 20%, 25% per year. And so what we've seen so far has been pretty well within our expectations and guidance. We just haven't seen as many convert over to QBO yet as we would've expected. So we're testing some different price points, as Brad said, we want to be sure that customers who are using QuickBooks, whether their using desktop or online, are using the absolute best product, the best solution, and that we make it easy for them to make that choice and getting the product. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And Ross, this is Brad. If I could just add a quick point and just built on the answer I gave to Brent a couple of minutes ago as well, this is really a good new story for us. For many years we sat in front of you and talked about 4 million installed users on QuickBooks and every time we had a quarter, we would say well, why aren't we growing that base. We're growing the base now because QuickBooks Online is expanding the total addressable market. So we've raised guidance on QuickBooks Online units twice this year and that's even with the migration from the desktop not happening at the pace we thought. And that's because eight out of 10 of these people have never used software before and they're coming into the category. That is good news. The second piece of good news for us is the lifetime value awash. So the lifetime value on desktop of $1,400 and for QBO right now its $1,400, and so as long as we keep the customers happy on desktop and they get the features built out in QuickBooks Online and then help them make that migration on their timeframe, it's a win-win for us. So we aren't sitting awake at night worried about the desktop customers not moving, we're committed to getting them to the cloud, but we wanted to it on their timeframe so we don't send them off to a competitor and we're feeling pretty good about how it's playing out so far. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks and maybe just a follow up, you said you \u2013 or both of you probably are seeing this that you know that those customers are not going elsewhere. How do you know that? Is there some way you can see usage on desktop product users? I'm just curious as to how you actually \u2013 or is it survey work. How do you know they're not going anywhere else? R. Neil Williams - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The main thing that I rely on, Ross, is just our own communication with those customers, survey data, input we get through our call center and through our care support agents, is what leads me to feel comfortable about that. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kasthuri G. Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi. Nice quarter, guys. First on the TurboTax retention which you have improved by 3 percentage points, what helped you and how sustainable is the space of improvement? And on the small business side, Brad, I think you mentioned the lifetime value of $1,400 what are the attach rate assumptions you're using to generate that lifetime value as far as payments and payroll are concerned? And if those attach rates were to move higher in the future, I would presume that you have more aggressive targets, how much would the lifetime value expand? That's it. Thank you. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right, Kash, thank you. Well, let me start with retention first. I had mentioned that this the second year of our multi-year effort where our team has been going in behind the vision of taxes are done. So finding access to data, so customers could actually import their W2 electronically. You may remember, last quarter, we talked about a third of the customers last year could do that. This year, over three-fourths of them could, over 75% could. And we've seen that if they have any data already input in their tax return, it increases conversion. And then if they have a great experience this year, that increases retention next year and the best leading indicator on retention is an improvement in Net Promoter Score, and it went up 5 points this year. So we feel very good that because of the products being more customized to your particular tax situation and we're having you do less work as we're able to import data electronically that we're able to basically continue to improve conversion and retention. That's really what's driving TurboTax. And we'll break more of that down when we get to Investor Day in the fall. The second is on the lifetime value and I'll go back to Investor Day again. We put a slide into this past September and it really has all the assumptions laid out in there for the lifetime value of desktop versus online. I think at the summary level, what we've put in there as a forecast is today desktop is less reliant on the accounting price and more on the payroll and the payments because it's got a heavier penetration of those attached services. QBO today is less mature that way, so it's actually heavier on the accounting subscription every month and a little lower on payroll and payments. But as you just suggested, every new customer we bring in is attaching at a higher rate. And so we think that improving \u2013 we see that improving over time in an absolute basis. The only thing that will work against that is that we're starting to move into new countries, where we don't have payroll and payments yet available. So that will bring the mix down a little bit on the average. And then we're also introducing QuickBook Self-Employed, which are small sole proprietors who don't have employees, so they won't have payroll. So on an absolute apples-to-apples basis, we see the lifetime value of QuickBooks Online, with the payments and payroll attach rates getting stronger, improving. But when you put it in the mix of those global units as well as QuickBook Self-Employed, that will be a headwind we'll work against, but ultimately that will pay off over time as well. And there is a lot more detail in that particular presentation in September if you want to pull that down, but I hope that hits the high level for you. Kasthuri G. Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Absolutely it does. And just as a follow up with the \u2013 how is the transition from the opt out to opt in coming along and are the attrition characteristics shaping up the way you expected after you made this change? Thank you. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I believe you're referring to our payroll change where... Kasthuri G. Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Yeah. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...a few quarters ago \u2013 yes, absolutely, Kash. It is paying off. So what's happened now is the retention rates in the cohorts of the customers that are with us 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days are improving. And so what has happened is, when we have people default into payroll, people found out after a couple of bills that they were getting charged for payroll and they didn't want it. They were frustrated and it caused our attrition to spike. Since we switched to opt out, the right customers are now selecting payroll and we've seen an improvement in our retention, which is one of the biggest leverage you have in a recurring revenue service. So it's paying off the way we want and that's reflected in the growth rate we had in payroll this quarter. Kasthuri G. Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Wonderful. Thank you. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. On the QuickBooks Online, I caught the data migration comment, but did you update in terms of where you are on the advanced inventory modules that you thought would help with conversions from desktop to online? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Sterling. I didn't call it out specifically, I referenced other features. But just to be specific about the advanced features, you know we did an acquisition of a small company called Lettuce and that brings advanced inventory capabilities that pretty much gives us the parity with QuickBooks Pro on the desktop. Our current timeline is to have those fully implemented in the late summer timeframe and then begin to have more of a conversion focus for the desktop customers in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, so in the fall. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And on the Consumer Tax side, now that \u2013 looking back at the customers that you brought on, so the new customers, especially at the low-end, is there any sense of how we should think about those migrating up to being higher ARPU paying customers next year and the year after that? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'll give you a two-part answer on that one, Sterling. If you go back to when we first went to free in 2004, we've gotten wiser about how to help customers realize the value of moving to a paid skew. And that comes through a whole host of things, the ability to import year-over-year information, the ability to get access to services like a refund bonus on an Amazon gift card. And so every year, that we've had free, we've actually been able to hold or improve our revenue per return over many of those years. This year, I would say was the biggest step forward. If you look at the fact that we had the Absolute Zero program, free federal and free state for a period of time in the early part of season and yet we exceeded our revenue guidance range, that was really a result of a couple of important things In addition to just growing customers which grows revenue, we had a better mix and that was because of last year's lineup change we made to TurboTax Online where we got customers into the right products, so they weren't trading down mid-season. But the other one was this new bundle we put out there called \u2013 it was basically the Absolute Zero. It was called free plus. What was the brand? R. Neil Williams - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Free plus bundle. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, free plus bundle. And what it basically was, was you can move up to a $29.99 bundle and you would get access to storage and vault capabilities. You would have the ability to do a refund transfer. You would have the ability to get an Amazon gift card and we saw a really strong take rate there. So if you think about that going forward next year, I think our track record is we can bring people in on free. We can monetize many of them in the same season. But we also tend to monetize more of them the following season and that just continues to be a formula that pays off. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Two quick questions. Brad, to just to wrap up the tax season question, remember on the Analyst Day you talked about the four drivers and if they all come together then you can see a better growth rate than we saw over the last few years. Now you delivered the 9% growth. How comfortable are you about the sustainability of these results? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Raimo, right now, we put out there an outlook that we think that this business can grow 5% to 10% and, last year, we were on the upper-end of that range and this year we're on the upper-end of that range. And as Neil said, we had a self-inflicted wound. We made a change to our desktop product lineup that cost us about $20 million. And if we hadn't done that and we have been able to do what we normally do and execute, it could've been a double-digit growth year for us in revenue. So I think the question is fair. Right now, we haven't changed the outlook on 5% to 10%. But we're clearly hugging the upper-end of that range. And you know our company's financial principles are we believe we have businesses that can grow double-digits organically. So I have increased confidence of two strong years in a row, but we're not changing the outlook yet beyond 5% to 10%. But I think it's a fair question and conversation we can have when we head into the new fiscal year as well. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. And a quick question for Neil or maybe Brad for you as well. You obviously have a very strong cash position. As you go towards more subscription focus, your results will be even more predictable. How do you think about dividends? I saw the increase now, but your yield is relatively low. Is that something on the top of your mind when you talk with the board? R. Neil Williams - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. It's certainly one of the tools in the tool box when we think about capital allocation and how to invest and spend going forward. We're still pretty early as a divided payer and we brought the dividend amount up aggressively over the last couple of years. We'll review our plan overall with the board in July and talk about a number of things around capital allocation, see where it goes and see where it goes from there. But you're right, the predictability and visibility into our cash flows and cash position is pretty strong. Free cash flow of the company is doing great. And so we'll see how that allocates between internal investment, opportunities to grow inorganically and the share repurchase and dividend. They're all \u2013 I like to think of them as levers we can use to return cash to shareholders and grow the business. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick - Jefferies LLC : Thanks very much. After a great tax season, I know the whole team doesn't just go off to Disneyland to celebrate and I'm sure you're already contemplating lessons learned and how you're going to apply those going forward. So I just wanted to touch on two issues that we're very topical this season. First, fraud, and I know and you've remarked on it a few times in the prepared remarks, and it's always been very important to protect the taxpayer from fraud. And the other one is, the Affordable Care Act. Is there anything that was learned this season that changes the way you approach these topics next season? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Brad. Thanks. First of all, you're right. We didn't head off to Disneyland or Disney World. The team's already working hard for season and I'm excited to see that sort of enthusiasm. The tax season lesson, starting with fraud, it is clearly a situation. It is a massive attack on the U.S. tax system. It's not a company-specific challenge and there is nothing we take more seriously than the privacy and security of our customers' information and the privacy and security information in the tax industry. So while we continue to make advances in our own product offerings, think about multi-factor authentication, the acquisition of a company called Porticor in Israel, which is a leading security data encryption firm. And we're working with outside third parties like Mandiant, Palantir, FireEye, all those players and all those pieces are coming together. We're also at the table. We're sitting with the IRS Commissioner, with the state agencies, with our peers in the industry, and we have working groups going on as we speak to try to develop a set of standards and best practices to advance the collective safety of the entire U.S. tax system. And we have another meeting coming up in June and there will be information that the IRS Commissioner and others may choose to release after that meeting, but net-net, we are committed to this. There are lots of lessons learned as an industry. We're going to continue to raise our game and hopefully help the entire industry raise their game. The second is on ACA, the Affordable Care Act. I think the lesson learned here is that if we continue to do what we've done for three decades, make things that could be complicated sample. They do not become an event for change, they actually become a catalyst for growth. A great example is we've studied really hard what happened in Massachusetts, when at the time Governor Romney introduced a version of this. We learned from those situations and those behaviors and we took action. And so while many thought that this would drive behavior shift from do-it-yourself to assisted, we thought it would be a catalyst, and so our teams worked really hard to make it simple. And a proof point was, this year one of the highest converting sections of turbotax.com from traffic into an actual customer was the Affordable Care Act section. Our team nailed it. And so, that's why the digital category grew 6% and I think the assisted category, again, was roughly flat. Now we know next year, there's going to be another big step forward. The penalties go up 2x, everyone has to have proof of insurance and we're already working on that as well. We refuse to make that a reason for customers to lose confidence and we're going to bring our A-game and try to continue to push it forward. So the lessons are courage isn't the absence of fear, it's the willingness to stand up and face it. The Affordable Care Act was a boogeyman and it remains a boogeyman and we're standing up and we're facing it and I think we're helping customers through it pretty well. Brad Zelnick - Jefferies LLC : Those are really important issues and I really appreciate your perspective. If I could just follow up with a quick one for Neil. Neil, the consumer segment margin is down a few hundred basis points versus a year ago. Can you just dive into that for us and specifically talk about acquisition costs for TurboTax? Thanks again. R. Neil Williams - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I think what you see in there is the $35 million divot we had this year; part of that on the revenue side for the desktop lineup and part of it for a care cost around security and privacy. Those things hit us kind of after we had our plan baked for this year and already made some other commitments. As we think about next year and going forward, we included that in our resource allocation expectations going forward. And so, yeah, that's how we think about that. It's clearly outstanding for us to perform as well as we did with the headwinds we had. Brad Zelnick - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good afternoon, guys, and congratulations. I'm going to follow on that last question. And Neil, ask you just \u2013 I think you made a comment about some increased investment in consumer tax that will affect the fourth quarter. Could you just bridge a little bit the EPS outperformance in the third quarter, yet the full year guidance not going up as much in the fourth quarter guidance down a little bit? I know you also had that non-core sale in payments and I assume that's part of the answer, but just a little bridge there. Thanks. R. Neil Williams - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure, Scott. I think most of the issue around the fourth quarter is just difficulty in modeling it out and hard for people to understand how the ratable impacts are going to flow through the full year. We're not anticipating any substantial investments in Consumer Tax in Q4 beyond what we have baked into our normal regular plan or things like that. So fourth quarter is kind of light for us. But I think the only \u2013 the biggest difference there between what a lot of people had in their models and what we're guiding to today, is really just been a difficulty of understanding the ratable impacts through the full year. The comment I made about investments in Consumer Tax is just primarily an explanation for why we're able to raise our revenue guidance for the full year with operating income remaining in the same range. That $35 million I just mentioned certainly has an impact on that and flows through at a pretty significant rate to operating income. So that's a big change in that area. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And was the payments asset sale meaningful to the bottom line? R. Neil Williams - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No. It was $30 million gross, so it wasn't that impactful overall. It wasn't material to us in terms of operating income or EPS. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks guys. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And GAAP only. GAAP only, Scott. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Appreciate it. Swinging over to Consumer Tax, on the Absolute Free, obviously, I think that's been very helpful. You mentioned on an earlier question that the last two years have been very impressive volume and with regard to revenue per return. I'm not sure where do go from incrementally from Absolute Free so \u2013 and you maybe you formulating this in the off season, we hear about Investor Day. But, Brad, could you give comments on what the next step is and what you're seeing with these bundle attaches and how strong revenue per return is that makes you, as you answered an earlier question, confident about the higher-end of the long-term guidance range for Consumer Tax. Thanks? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, Scott, first of all, I don't want to raise anybody's expectations that we're changing the 5% to 10% outlook. I think the question was fair when you were at 9% and you had a couple of things this year that could've made it double-digits out. But that being said, as operators, we're very bullish on the do-it-yourself tax business. First of all, there has been a question for a few years that is there any opportunity to expand the TAM, the total addressable market. And we said, look, there are 148 million people who file tax returns, about 50 million do software, we think there is. And if you look at the fact that you have new filers coming into the category every year, 3 million to 5 million. This year, we actually outperformed versus our forecast on getting our fair share of those new filers. The second is we were able to take share from the assisted category, which has been a question. And we've taken several points of share over the last two years and that's from the data reported by the IRS when you look at all the data that's out there. And so this category has opportunity. The neat thing about Absolute Zero is it's pretty much impossible for anyone to price lower than free federal and free state. But what is hard is to figure out how to do that and turn that into a paying customer. And we've got a lot of work and a lot of experience that's helped us do that. And so we're getting much wiser at using that kind of a tool to expand the TAM and then really good at or much better getting monetization programs whether it's attached services or new bundles to turn those into paying customers and that's the bullishness that you hear us talking about, that's what's the product innovations. So we'll talk more in the fall about what does that mean to the long-term outlook, but right now, I like these last two years and I like the momentum that team has built, and I really have confidence that our tax business has a lot of upside as we look ahead. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Dunham from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Greg E. Dunham - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Yes. Thanks, guys. Just one for me and I'll switch gears back to the small business group. If you look at QuickBooks Online in the U.S., you've doubled that subscriber base over the past two years. What are you seeing in terms of retention of those QBO subscribers specifically in the U.S.? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Greg, what we're seeing right now is the retention rates are in mid to high 70%s. We're improving the retention rates on a cohort basis, as you get payroll and payment attach rates, the more services that you sign up for the stickier you become. Obviously, the product continues to get stronger, the new version, which we call Harmony, which continues to get more feature functionality on it, just adds more reasons for customers to stay. So right now, when you put it together in the U.S. it's in that mid to high 70%s, is the retention rate for QBO. Greg E. Dunham - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Perfect. Thanks, guys. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Macdonald from First Analysis. Your line is open. Please go ahead. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, guys. What are your takeaways with the \u2013 trying to up shift people on desktop, do you think you'll be able to do that in the future or you not going to pursue that anymore? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jim, are you talking about QuickBooks Desktop? James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: No, the TurboTax product, trying to get them right sized to the product. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, I see. So kind of referring to the mistake we made this year where we've tried to move feature functionality to match what we had in online and we had obviously some upset customers. No, we learned our lesson on that one, Jim. And what we learned is, the TurboTax Online customers have a very different expectation and a set of experiences they want. Our TurboTax Desktop customers, many of them began with letters that say, I've been using this product for 20 years. They want a great product that does exactly what they want it to do and they don't want a whole lot of changes to it unless it's going to make it easier for them. And so, we're not going to be trying to mirror image TurboTax Online and TurboTax Desktop. We're going to make sure we deliver the best experience for the customer on whichever platform they want. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Great. And then, it sounds like you really improved your sales and marketing efficiency for TurboTax this year, maybe you could talk us through some of the things you were successful with? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I would just \u2013 at a high level without giving out too many of the secret that I know, our marketing team would tell me, please don't talk too much about this stuff. I would say, first of all, this was a very competitive tax season. Very, very good competition that we're always up against and they brought their A-game. They improved their products. There was aggressive spend in advertizing and marketing. There was aggressive pricing promotions out there and even when we had the issue that we created for ourselves with the desktop product, our team stood in there and really had a good season. And one of the things I would say is, despite the fact that we did not spend to the level that we believe some of the competitors did, we actually held share in traffic and improved market share in terms of conversion into paid customers. And so we have a more efficient program because our message speaks to the end user. Don't be afraid of taxes, don't be afraid of the Affordable Care Act, it's amazing what you're capable of. It's simply yes and no answers to questions and then you will be able to get your taxes done and keep more money in your pocket. That resonated last year, that resonated this year and we think we're going to continue to help empower the end user, so they believe in themselves next year as well. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Great. Thanks. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Thank you, Jim. Good talking to you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Thank you and good afternoon. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, David. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Could you comment \u2013 Brad, could you comment on unit pricing strategy both for TurboTax Online and QuickBooks Online over the next 12 to 24 months? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, David, I'll talk about it. As an overall philosophy, we don't want to, at this point, start talking about our processing lineup for the next year. It's a very competitive market out there. But I would say overall, we've learned some important lessons about pricing and it really comes down to price value. So we tend to have the entry level price for all of our products as free; either free TurboTax or an extended period or a trail period in QuickBooks Online. But we also have learned that we can introduce additional services that we refer to as attached services and those attached services customers resonate with the value proposition and they go ahead and they add those on and it gets an increased revenue per customer. On the upper-end of our product lineup, we start to run into much higher price competitors and that's where we can tend to take some price, so QuickBooks Enterprise, for example. It's about the third the price of the midmarket ERP, so we're able to take a little more price there. When you get up to the upper-end of TurboTax, the next alternative is going to a tax store and paying a couple of hundred dollars. So we're able to take a little price there. So we really have surgical pricing. We never get undercut on the low-end. We're getting smarter to monetize with attached services in the middle and we take price where we've earned the right to do that against higher price competitors on the high-end and that tended to be the philosophy that's worked for us. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Understood. Thank you very much. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Millman from Millman Research and Associates. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thank you. Looking at the IRS numbers, you see that do-it-yourself or self-prepare, as they call it, increased about twice as much as the total, whereas assisted was caught flattish, actually up a little. So the question is \u2013 or comment is for the question, to what extent is do-it-yourself still taking market from paper and how much of that is really left to move? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Michael, I would tell you, first of all, you know these numbers well and you and I'll talk about this stuff when we do our one-on-ones. We're down to 5 million, 6 million, I think, in total that the IRS says are out there in paper. When you look at the source of new customers we have, because we're able to tell what you did, we're able to see if you used another software package, you went to a store, you went to a CPA or you're on paper. This growth in do-it-yourself is not coming just from paper. It is a secular trend towards digital and, in fact, we've taken 3 points of the category to do-it-yourself or, as you've said, the self-prepared category has taken 3 points of share away from the assisted category over the last two years. And I think that's a fundamental belief that ultimately plays out because new tax filers come in and they're much more comfortable with technology these days. We have value proposition like Absolute Zero as well as easier to use products that can import your data for you, so you don't have to do any work. That's actually telling people, wow, I could get this done at a much lower price than if I go to a tax store. And those are the realities and I think, by the way, they play out even in our competitors' numbers. If you look at their own mix, whether they own stores and they also have software, look at which of their businesses are growing faster in terms of returns and you can see the digital business are growing faster than the assisted prepared and I think that's just a secular trend that's going to continue. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Well, understood, but kind of wondering the sources. Have you talked about what your share was Absolute Zero or what share of your tax returns were Absolute Zero and what the growth has been in kind of the zero range from absolute to semi-absolute? Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I liked the term, Mike. No, we haven't broken that level of detail out. As we get into the September Analyst Day, we'll tend to share a little more information around some of those pieces. But, at this point, no, we didn't share any of that data. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thanks, Brad. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over for closing remarks. Brad D. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Well, I'm going to thank everybody for your questions and your comments. We're heading into the home stretch of this fiscal year and we really like our position. We feel our financial results are strong and we're coming off one of the best quarters in our history. And while this momentum really feels good, we're certainly not resting on our laurels or as someone said earlier, we haven't let the teams go off to Disneyland or Disney World. They're so fired up they're already ready for next season. And as we look to our fourth quarter and beyond, Neil and I are really encouraged by the steps that we're taking to further strengthen the position in all of our businesses and functions. So with that, I really want to thank you for your time today and we want to wish everybody a good and restful Memorial Day weekend. Thanks a lot. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

My name is Latif, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt Rhodes, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Rhodes. Matt Rhodes : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Intuit's fourth quarter fiscal 2015 conference call. I'm here with Brad Smith, our President and CEO; and Neil Williams, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. Also, all reported results and fiscal 2016 guidance exclude Demandforce, QuickBase and Quicken, which have been declared held for sale and reclassified to discontinued operations. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad Smith. Brad Smith : All right. Thank you, Matt, and thanks all of you for joining us. We have positive results to discuss for the fiscal year that we just finished. We also want to share some strategic decisions that position us for accelerated performance longer term. So with that, let\u2019s get started and I\u2019ll begin with our results. We closed out our fiscal year 2015 on a strong note, with excellent momentum in each of our businesses. For the full fiscal year, total revenue and earnings per share both came in above the high-end of our guidance range, before reclassifying our planned divestitures. QuickBooks Online reached nearly 1.1 million paid subscribers through the end of the quarter, also ahead of our guidance for the fiscal year, which we increased midyear. Looking beyond the current period results, we are playing from a position of strength. We\u2019re fully committed to winning in the cloud, and we\u2019re focusing our attention and investments on assets that accelerate our ability to deliver our two strategic goals, first, to be the operating system behind small business success, and second, to do the nations\u2019 taxes. With this focus, we have decided to divest Demandforce, QuickBase and Quicken. Let me provide some context about why we made these decisions. Demandforce and QuickBase are great businesses, but they do not support the QuickBooks Online Ecosystem and both serve customers that are up-market from our core small business customers. For Demandforce, we are seeking a buyer who will invest in this industry-leading marketing solution with a growing and talented sales force. Divesting QuickBase has a similar effect, freeing both Intuit and QuickBase to focus on better serving the needs of our respective, but distinct, customers. As you can imagine, Quicken holds a special place in the hearts of all of us at Intuit. It was our first innovation and the cornerstone of the company that we\u2019ve built over the past 32 years. Quicken is a strong, healthy business and remains America\u2019s number one personal finance software. As you know, Quicken is a desktop-centric business and it doesn\u2019t strengthen the small business or tax ecosystems. Our strategy is focused on building ecosystems and platforms in the cloud. We value our loyal Quicken customers and we\u2019re seeking a buyer who will provide the product support and the service they deserve. These decisions impact our longer-term financial trajectory, which Neil will provide more detail on in a moment. But first, let me click down and share my reflections on the company's performance, starting with our Small Business Group. QuickBooks Online continues to build momentum. We grew total QuickBooks Online subscribers by 57% in the fourth quarter, up from 55% in the previous quarter. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of accelerating paid subscriber growth. We added 110,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers in the quarter and we now have 1,075,000 paid subs worldwide. Roughly 25,000 of our QuickBooks Online subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed, which is up from 15,000 last quarter, and outside the U.S., QuickBooks Online grew over 135% to 198,000 paying subscribers. Shifting to our Consumer Tax business, the team delivered an exceptional year. As the category champion, we helped drive digital category growth of about 5%, compared with assisted tax prep methods being roughly flat. Within the software category, we estimate that TurboTax Online gained about a point-and-a-half of share, translating into four points of share gains over the past two seasons. In the U.S., TurboTax Online units grew 11%, and total TurboTax units grew 7% excluding the Free File Alliance. Hitting the total key, Consumer Tax revenue grew 8% for the fiscal year. It\u2019s a little too early in the game for me to talk about our tax strategy for next season. But as we\u2019ve demonstrated for two consecutive years, we will continue to focus on driving customer growth and share. Security will also remain a critical priority for us. We are working closely with the IRS, state governments and the tax prep industry to create a new set of common security standards and data protocols to accelerate the fight against tax fraud. We\u2019ll continue to invest in this area to lead the charge towards greater security for all taxpayers. In addition, the proposed Information Sharing and Analysis Center is particularly critical to enable information sharing among federal and state governments and the industry. This will significantly strengthen our efforts to collectively find solutions and to fight fraud. When you sum it all up at the company level, customer growth is accelerating, active use is improving, and global adoption is hitting its stride. We are creating a clear value proposition for our small business and our tax customers, and we continue to innovate and take share in our large addressable markets. We are investing in the areas with the biggest long-term payoff, setting Intuit up for strong customer and revenue growth for years to come. With that overview, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details. Neil Williams : Thanks Brad. As Matt mentioned up front, the results I\u2019ll discuss exclude the assets held for sale that are classified as discontinued operations. We\u2019ve included a supplemental page on the fact sheet that shows fiscal 2015 and historical results including the assets held for sale. For fiscal 2015, we delivered revenue of $4.2 billion; non-GAAP operating income of $1.1 billion; GAAP operating income of $738 million; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.59; GAAP earnings per share of $1.28. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we delivered revenue of $696 million; a non-GAAP operating loss of $16 million; GAAP operating loss of $130 million; non-GAAP loss per share of $0.05; and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.05. These results factor in our decision from last year to deliver ongoing services and releases for certain desktop offerings to encourage migration to online solutions. As a result, revenue for these desktop software licenses is now recognized as services are delivered, rather than upfront. Turning to the business segments. Total Small Business Group revenue declined 5% for the quarter and 2% for the year, better results than we expected. QuickBooks total paying customers grew 7% for the year, accelerating from last year. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew approximately 25% for the year, excluding Demandforce and QuickBase, and customer acquisition in our Online Ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 57%, accelerating from last quarter. Online active payments customers grew 5% and online payments charge volume grew 19%. Online payroll customers grew 18%. We\u2019re very pleased with customer growth and revenue per customer for QuickBooks Online subscribers in fiscal 2015. We\u2019re expanding the market, which is great news for the long-term health of the business. We\u2019re bringing in newer-to-the-world small businesses with QuickBooks Self-Employed, and we like QuickBooks Online subscriber growth outside the U.S. More than 40% of our QuickBooks Online subscribers have been with us for less than a year. Many of these customers are on introductory promotional pricing, so we expect our revenue per customer to increase over time. Additionally, we have opportunities to grow revenue per customer by improving retention and attach longer term. We\u2019ll provide more detail on average revenue per customer at our Investor Day on September 17. We are focused on opportunities to improve conversion and retention around the globe, which are our two biggest levers for driving monetization. As we continue to focus on driving customer growth and expanding our total addressable market, we expect customer growth will continue to exceed revenue growth. Switching to desktop, total Desktop Ecosystem revenue declined 10% for the year, as expected. QuickBooks desktop units declined 14% for the quarter and 22% for the year, as we continue to emphasize QuickBooks Online. The strong acquisition of new customers in QuickBooks Online has more than offset the decline in desktop units. Moving over to tax. Consumer Tax revenue grew 8% for the year. We will continue to invest in the product experience and to prioritize growth in customers over margin expansion. ProTax revenue declined 33% for the year, due to changes in our offerings that resulted in ratable revenue recognition. These changes shifted roughly $150 million in revenue to fiscal 2016. Our ProTax business also had a great season, with customer growth coming in higher than expected, new offerings beginning to have an impact and revenue exceeding the high end of our guidance range. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15%. With approximately $1.7 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. In fiscal 2015, we completed six acquisitions totaling approximately $120 million. These acquisitions brought talent and technology to help us achieve our strategic goals. When it's the best use of cash, we'll return cash to shareholders via share repurchases. In fiscal 2015, we repurchased $1.25 billion of shares. We have $2.6 billion remaining on our authorization and we also reduced our share count 2%, net, in fiscal 2015. We expect to be in the market each quarter in fiscal 2016. Our capital plans include a cash dividend of up to $1.20 per share for fiscal 2016, with the first quarter dividend of $0.30 per share payable on October 19. This represents a 20% increase versus last year and reflects our confidence in our business strategy and our large and growing cash position, as well as more recurring and predictable revenue streams. You can find our guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. One thing to note is that Mint, Mint Bills and OFX were part of the Consumer Ecosystem Group but are not included in the assets held for sale. They will be reported as part of the Small Business segment going forward, given the importance of those assets and the QuickBooks Ecosystem. Selling the non-strategic assets we discussed pulls around $250 million in revenue and $0.10 in non-GAAP earnings per share out of fiscal 2016. We will be reporting these held-for-sale assets as discontinued operations, and our P&L has been recast on this basis for all periods presented. We guided fiscal 2016 QuickBooks Online subscribers of 1.450 million to 1.5 million, growth of 40% at the high end of the range. Last year at this time we talked about our long-term outlook to help you bridge the transition in our business model. Let me take a minute to share how I\u2019m thinking about our progress versus the outlook we discussed last year. QuickBooks Online customer acquisition remains strong, and we're feeling confident in our subscriber target for fiscal 2017. This is a franchise with a bright future. We told you we\u2019d end fiscal 2017 at 2 million subscribers, and we are confident in the long-term monetization potential of these customers and our expanding addressable market. Given the planned divestitures and the projected mix of Small Business customers, I don\u2019t expect us to book revenue of $5.8 billion in fiscal 2017. This will likely take another year or so. The third component of our long-term outlook was an earnings per share target of approximately $5 per share. We still see a path to achieve this, but our first priority is investing in the long-term value of this franchise, as you\u2019d expect. We're selling some things that don't fit strategically, and we'll continue to prioritize customer growth over margin expansion near term. The excellent growth we\u2019ve seen in 2015 leads us to be more focused than ever on our businesses with the most traction and best growth opportunities. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith : Thank you, Neil. So let me spend a moment on the fiscal 2017 outlook that Neil just summarized. As a management team, we take our commitments seriously. And at the same time, we remain committed to making the necessary decisions to position this company for an even stronger future. Our transformation from a North American desktop software company to a global cloud-driven company is tracking ahead of our expectations, as illustrated by the QuickBooks Online paid subscriber growth that Neil just covered. With that said, as we expand our categories and enter new markets, the customers we\u2019re bringing in are earlier in their lifecycle and, when combined with our decision to divest assets that no longer strategically fit, the result is a conscious decision to push out our fiscal 2017 revenue target just a bit. I\u2019ve never had greater confidence in our strategy, in our execution, or in our trajectory as we build this company for the long term. We\u2019ve just closed out another great year. Our small business momentum continues to build and our QuickBooks Online ecosystem growth is accelerating, driving value for customers and for Intuit. Our tax business had another season-winning year, delivering great products to our customers as well as outstanding financial results. We\u2019ve made tough decisions to sell non-strategic assets, and we\u2019ve prioritized our investments on those initiatives that will further accelerate our online ecosystem globally, while ensuring the best product experience for customers who wish to remain on desktop. If history shows us anything, it\u2019s that we have a proven formula. When we innovate and delight customers with the best solutions in the market, we expand our categories, we grow our share and we increase lifetime value over time. Our cloud-based solutions are doing just that, and they will accelerate our company\u2019s overall performance as a result. We\u2019ll talk more about these themes and our strategy to execute against them at our Investor Day, which we\u2019re going to hold on our Mountain View campus on September 17. We do look forward to seeing everybody there. But with that, Latif, let me open it back up to you to hear what\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Zelnick of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Thank you very much. And thanks for taking my question. Lot of interesting news today, Brad. It\u2019s good to see you maintain your $5 EPS target for '17 and the increased capital returns post the planned divestitures. Can you just help us resolve your comments about, or Neil\u2019s comments, if it is about prioritizing growth, while still being able to deliver $5 EPS in '17? And specifically, where does the margin come from in order to hit that goal, assuming that the combined businesses that you\u2019re divesting are profitable? Can you give us some insight there? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes. I will tell you what, Brad. First of all, Neil and I will tag team on this. Let me start by just clarifying one thing. We see a path to achieving a $5 EPS goal in 2017, but our first commitment is continuing to invest in growth. So as you think about the three pieces of outlook we provided last year, which were really to help you bridge the accounting change to ratable revenue. There weren\u2019t really a multi-year forecast or more [of look here a] [ph] key milestones. We feel very good about our QBO subscriber target. We consciously made a decision to push out that revenue a year or so. And we still see a path to achieve a $5 EPS target. But we\u2019re going to trade that off against whether or not we had better alternatives, whether there is investment to accelerate our markets or increase our customer growth. So we will provide more guidance on fiscal year '17 when we actually get to the end of next year. With that said, let me talk to you about how do you get that kind of leverage. Well, first of all, the number one lever we have is accelerating topline growth. We are increasing our total addressable markets. We will talk more about this at Investor Day. We are accelerating our customer growth and we see real plans, clear plans for monetizing these customers and I will give you an example. Neil mentioned that 40% of the QuickBooks Online base are in the first year with the product. We know that as you enter year two and year three that average revenue per user increases over 50%. So just as they mature and move into year two and year three, we have real leverage to produce more revenue per customer. At the same time, the thing that\u2019s exciting us is over 80% of these QuickBooks Online customers are new to the franchise, so we are actually expanding the category and accelerating topline opportunity. The other thing I will tell you is Neil and the team and all of management team remain very disciplined behind our financial principles. We invest in things that we can see a 15% rate of return and whether those are internal investments to expand R&D or new market or they are stock repurchases or acquisitions we\u2019re going to continue to use our capital judiciously, so we get the best return on that capital. So it\u2019s basically accelerating our topline growth, remaining rigorous about our capital allocation, and that gives us the path to $5. We will talk about whether or not that becomes our target in fiscal '17 when we actually set expectations at the end of next year. Neil anything you would add to that or\u2026? Neil Williams : No. I think that\u2019s fair. I think that covers it unless Brad has another question. Brad Smith : Okay. Brad Zelnick : Yes. I just have a one quick other one and I might have missed this. But did you comment to new QBO attach rates for payment and payroll in the US? Can you give us an update on those numbers? Brad Smith : We didn\u2019t, Brad, but I can. New QBO, right now, for payroll is running at 23% attach rate, which is consistent with last quarter and where we thought it would be. Payments once again took a step forward. We are now looking at an 11% attach rate on new QBO, which is up from 9% the last time we provided the numbers. So the attach rates continue to look healthy in both of those attach services. Brad Zelnick : That\u2019s great. I don\u2019t need to be hog, but while we\u2019re on that topic just one more. If you look at payroll, Brad, and you parse it through sort of an apples to apples. So if I take QBO, but I eliminate Self-Employed and international subs where there may not be an opportunity to attach, what are the attach rates look like then when comparing QBB to QBO on an apples to apples basis? Matt Rhodes : It\u2019s Matt here, Brad. So the attach rates would be lower than 23% that Brad talked about is just for QuickBooks Online in the US to the extent that Self-Employed starts to grow meaningfully that could dilute it a little bit. But we do think there is opportunities longer term to add payments or other services, including TurboTax to the Self-Employed customers. Brad Smith : And Brad, just to build on that, we\u2019ve done and we will talk little bit more about this I am sure in Q&A, but we\u2019ve done half a dozen acquisitions in the last 12 months. Many of them were to accelerate our global expansion. Two of them were payroll specific. So we bought a product company called PaySuite in the UK, which allows payroll attach to QBO. We also brought a company called Acrede, which is a global payroll platform. So as Matt said, while the numbers I gave you are US specific, we see real opportunities to start to increase attach outside the US as well. Brad Zelnick : Well, thanks again for taking my questions. Brad Smith : All right. Thank you, Brad. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thanks. I guess Brad on your end, one of the things you have out there is an annual QuickBooks launch in the fall. And I think you talked about in the past that this -- you\u2019re sort of diverting a lot development resources away from the desktop product. And I am wondering how we should look at the launch in the fall. I mean, is this going to be a full-fledged launch with lots of new features on the desktop product that keeps people buying that desktop product? Or is there some catalyst do you think in the fall that drives people to realize that maybe there is nothing new here and it\u2019s time to move over to online? And I love to hear you\u2019re incorporating that. It looks like your desktop units actually declined less this quarter than we\u2019ve seen for the first three quarters of the year. So maybe that\u2019s leveling off. Brad Smith : Yes. Thanks, Walter. Let me start first with, we are committed to keeping our desktop customers excited and satisfied with the product, although you\u2019re correct we have leaned much of our R&D energy into QBO and building out the cloud ecosystem. So the desktop product will be a full-fledged launch. There won\u2019t be lots of new features. There will be important features and most importantly customer experience improvements that will help the customers continue to get the maximum quality out of the desktop product. What you\u2019re also going to see though is a little more of an elegance combining a QuickBooks desktop with QuickBooks Online. So when you go into the desktop products, you will have an opportunity to say, look do you want to use the desktop or the cloud version, and you will hear more about that when we get closer to launch. So we gave them more of a choice. So if they went to retail store and they picked up a box out or have it, they still have an opportunity to potentially choose to go to the cloud or to desktop. So that will be one of the things you will hear little bit more about. In terms of the desktop units declining, as we got into the fourth quarter, we continue to run test on how deep of a promotion we could run, what\u2019s promotional floor should be. And we think we started to find a sweet spot. We are able to continue to get customers who want to stay on desktop to upgrade, without actually discounting so much that people avoid the opportunity to go to the cloud. And that\u2019s why you saw a little less of a decline in the fourth quarter on units, down about 14% versus a full year of 22% and that really informs our go-forward plan as we look at fiscal year '16. Walter Pritchard : And then Neil, maybe on your end. We calculate the ARPU on QuickBooks Online to be down about 14% year-over-year. I heard in the prepared remarks you talked about how you feel about second year ARPU for example. And I think we understand that, but there does seem to be quite a bit of focus in the market -- in the financial markets around that ARPU metric. Do you foresee this sort of 14% decline that we saw this quarter to be the bottom in that metric? Or do you think that actually could get worse as you can see -- continue to see accelerated volumes, especially on some of those lower end products with new customer adds in fiscal '16? Neil Williams : Yes. Walter, you have to look at the cohort and you have to look at people coming in, as Brad mentioned, we have some tailwinds with customers, who have been with us longer than a year coming off of introductory promotional pricing that helps us. But our goal is to continue to grow the product category aggressively, some of that will be outside the US where the software monetization will be a little less than the first year. So we are going to talk more at Investor Day and show you some breakdowns between US and global, average revenue per user and talk about some of the effects of the cohorts. But long story short, there are some advantages from those customers who have been with us for longer than a year and to attach more services, but that\u2019s one of the reasons why I stated I expect the total number of customers to continue to grow faster than the revenue, because our hope is we will continue to add at a very accelerated pace outside the US and in categories, like Self-Employed. So we will talk more about them in the 17th and we will see how it plays out. But I\u2019d be willing to take certainly some dilution in the revenue per user to get a lot more customers and to grow the category. Walter Pritchard : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of UBS. Your question please. Brent Thill : Thanks. Neil, on the fiscal guide, many investors are asking, if you take out the divestitures your guidance is still below where the street was in print and many are asking is this partially due to a faster transition to the subscription model that is leaving you potentially with a little more conservative nature on the topline, but perhaps, you are seeing something, in terms of the backlog building on the subscription side that would lower your view for the year? Neil Williams : Brent, I think, there are two factors there, the first when you called out with the divestitures. We certainly had aggressive hopes for those businesses, when we put our plans together couple years ago. So that that is the single biggest factor in the guidance that we talked about for \u201916. The other thing we are looking at though is the mix of customers in small business. I referred to this briefly in the script. But the thing that\u2019s been interesting is that we were able to exceed our QBO goals with our desktop migrators being less than we had expected, less than we built into the plans. So the goodness is, these are more new to the franchise customers and we still have those desktop customers that are still there to migrate whenever they're ready and come forward. But it definitely has an impact on our revenue outlook from what we put together and shared to you 18-month ago. Brent Thill : Okay. So bulk of the divestitures and some of it from the mix? Neil Williams : Yeah. Brad Smith : Yeah. Brent Thill : Okay. And Brad, over the last decade we watched you do a lot of acquisitions? And I think everyone give you a lot of credit for effectively moving on and not trying to make deal with some assets that may not fit in perfectly that maybe you originally thought were fitting in? And so, I think, it brings up a big question from the -- the question from the capital that you are putting into as you mentioned these half a dozen acquisitions? Is this change your view on acquisitions at Intuit? Many of the larger ones have not gone well and you\u2019ve effectively divested those acquisitions? If you could maybe speak to how you believe you can fix that and what the strategy and how the strategies changed going forward? Brad Smith : Yeah. Brent, I can. Firs of all, we have learned a lot of lessons and I have learned a lot of lessons from our M&A track record, but during my time here, as well as those that were done before us and we do a rigorous study of those and we sit down with the Board once a year and we do a 10-year look back. We compare those to the business cases. We put together for the Board, as well as what we share with the street and the pattern recognition increasingly clear. We are pretty good, if not very good at talent and technology tuck-ins, and things that actually accelerate our time to market and our product line up or they put right into the ecosystem. We have a mixed record in terms of bolt-on businesses, new businesses that may not plug-in directly with QuickBooks or tax businesses and those are the things that we\u2019ve now got a new set of patterns that we\u2019ve defined as printable and we are saying, if we are going to look in the space going forward these are the criteria that these acquisitions have to meet. So I would tell you, we are much more informed group. Of these six we did last year, they totaled $120 million. The simple math is, the rough average is about $20 million a piece. So we are not big game hunters, because we\u2019ve learned from these acquisitions, but something came along that met the criteria that\u2019s informed from some of this pattern recognition, I mentioned, we wouldn\u2019t be shy about leaning into it. We are just much smarter now about the saying that we know we are pretty good at and the things we have work to do. Brent Thill : Great. Thank you. Brad Smith : Yeah. Go ahead, Neil. Neil Williams : I would just add on to that too that, some of these businesses we are selling are great businesses and are doing well. But they are not as tightly linked to the strategy as we would like and as we consider ways to really accelerate, doing the nations taxes and being the operating system for small business success, some things that are doing well and would do well on their own, just weren\u2019t as accretive as part of this portfolio. So assets like QuickBase and Quicken, to be specific, were not acquisitions per say or not recent acquisitions and things that\u2026 Brad Smith : Yeah. Neil Williams : \u2026 are still performing well. Brent Thill : Well said. Brad Smith : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Yes, sir. Brad Smith : No. Go ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan of RBC. Your question please. Ross MacMillan : Thanks for taking my question. Just a clarification, Neil, just so I am clear on this, so when we think about the fiscal \u201916 guidance, you comment on the disposal impact of $250 million on sales and $0.10 in non-GAAP EPS? Are really those the only changes fiscal \u201816 versus fiscal \u201915? There's no other incremental rev rec changes or anything else that that could be going on here? Just wanted to make sure I'm clear on that? Neil Williams : No, Ross. You are correct. Ross MacMillan : Great. And then, Brad, I know we talked a lot here about leaning into the transition and in some ways maybe trading off sort of near-term revenue for the unit opportunity and the ability to monetize these units overtime? I was just curious as you think about the customer lifetime value that you\u2019ve talked about historically? You probably give us more on Analyst Day? But is there anything changing in your view on that lifetime value for the QuickBooks Online Ecosystem or is your view that that's remaining pretty consistent with your prior view and what you're solving for effectively is the potential for higher units overtime? Brad Smith : Yeah. Ross, you are right. What we will do is, we are going to impact this and we are going to go down a couple layers deeper in a few weeks here on September 17th, because it has a few pieces. What we want to do is do a breakdown on a used case of QuickBooks Online in there U.S. where you have the full ecosystem available and we can share you what that lifetime value of the customer is and then we will share with you also the new QuickBooks Self-Employed and what the opportunities are there, as well as QuickBooks outside the U.S. and global market. And when you put all these three pieces together that forms an average lifetime value. But what you really get to see is the story of a new market, the story of the new segment and the story of a more fully built out ecosystem in the U.S. and it gives us a reason to believe that we have real confident in the lifetime value game plan we have for QuickBooks Online. And we just want to take the time to unpack that for you and everyone else so you can see the same thing we do on September 17th. So if you let us hold it off a couple weeks it will be a lot easier to follow, when you get the material to look at while we talk to it. Ross MacMillan : Understood. And just one last one for me, on Demandforce, as you reflect on, the time I talk about, maybe it was an acquisition that made a lot of sense, it was a nice addition to at least a segment of your small business base? That business being disposed is not necessarily keeping with the different but it is somewhat of a bolt-on, but I am just curious as you reflect on that, what\u2019s -- what maybe didn\u2019t work in the way that you thought it might with that acquisition specifically? Brad Smith : Yeah, Ross. For us, the good news is the business has doubled since we bought it. So it\u2019s grown. It\u2019s done well. It has had a good performance. Unfortunately performance wasn\u2019t benefited from being a part of Intuit in terms of customers from QuickBooks or some of the other ecosystems, who are trying to build and fuel as one ecosystem. So one of the challenges we had is product market fit. When we bought the business that we targeted to higher end of our QuickBooks customer base, it was a $300 a month subscription service and over the certain segment of vertical categories like spas and salons and automotive dealers -- I mean automotive services, those kinds of appointment-based businesses that really fit. It didn\u2019t fit the broad universe of QuickBooks customers but we thought we could actually build a lighter weight version, bring the price down and be able to market it to our customers where we sell about 400,000 look-alike prospects. Unfortunately that hypothesis did not play out the way we thought. The customers did sign up for the service. But the retention rates were significantly lower than our markets customers. And the product fit was actually better for and more larger business in the once we were trying to sell to. And so one of the things we face was that we continue to put money into that business or we continue to put money into growing QBO globally with payroll, payments and other services. And we did want to start with the business. So we just started. It doesn\u2019t strategically fit with QBO ecosystem. It\u2019s not getting real value from QuickBook or vice versa. And let\u2019s put it in the hands of someone who will invest in its best-in-class product and let it grow. And let us stay focused on our customer groups. So that\u2019s really what we learnt from the demand towards acquisition. Ross MacMillan : Thanks Brad. Appreciate the answers. Brad Smith : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your question please. Raimo Lenschow : Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s two actually. First of all, obviously we congratulate you on the progress on their QuickBooks Online subscribers growth and acceleration to EBITDA. Can you talk a little bit about online payroll subscriber growth that has been decelerating now for five, six quarters? And you talked about a high attach rate but how do I marry up these two figures? Can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes there please? Brad Smith : Yes, I think there is a couple of things, Raimo, and I\u2019ll see if Neil wants to add anything to it. Our online payroll customer growth was 18% this quarter. The attach rate as you said is holding at 23%. We have a little bit of grow over challenge. You may remember this time last year, we went from opt-out to opt-in in terms of the attached service. So last year, when we rolled it out to QBO, it defaulted to having payroll on. What we found after 90 days, we had some retention issues. We had some people who said I didn\u2019t know I signed up for payroll and they opted out. So instead what we did is we went to an opt-in service, we had the ability to chose payroll and we have a 23% attach rate which is very healthy but we also have a much more improved retention rate after 30, 60 and 90 day mark. So you got a little bit of an apples and oranges there. And it does impact a little bit of year-over-year compare in terms of the growth. Beyond that I'm not sure what else would you have. Matt Rhodes : One thing else to mention here, this is Matt. When you look at the online customers on our factsheet, majority of them actually are not connected to QuickBooks Online. Those that are attached to QuickBooks Online are growing really nicely, faster than what you see on the factsheet. And through some of our other channels, through accounts and other third parties, there is online payroll solutions where you don't need to be attached to QuickBooks Online. So that\u2019s part of the mix issue you\u2019re seeing there as well. Raimo Lenschow : Understood. Second question I have was on the international business. Can you talk a little bit about regional performances there? Obviously there is lots of stuff going on in the world. I know you are not in China but just kind of tell us a little bit more about what you see outside of U.S.? Brad Smith : Yeah, Raimo. This is Brad. Happy to do that. So our Canada business is on fire. It\u2019s doing incredibly well, continues accelerated result, good healthy ecosystem. Australia is also performing well although off of a small base. As you know, we entered that market about a year and half ago. And we\u2019re continuing to gain momentum there. The U.K. is also on a good solid trajectory. And as we have added out some of the other services like the PaySuite acquisition, the payroll acquisition, it\u2019s on a good run. India is a less mature product offering for us. We\u2019re still building out what we call the last mile of compliance. And so it\u2019s performing okay but it\u2019s not performing at same level of Canada, the U.K. or Australia for us. And then when you go beyond those, our two newer markets in the harbor is Brazil. We did an acquisition of a company called the ZeroPaper, and that is actually off to a pretty good start early days. And we\u2019re getting it quoted over to the QBO platform. And then we\u2019ll be opening up France. We\u2019re in beta right now. We\u2019ll be opening up France later in the calendar year, early part of next calendar year. And we\u2019ll talk about it as well. So across the globe, those are the countries, we\u2019re focused on right now. We don\u2019t have exposure to China or some of the other things that you\u2019re hearing about. But we\u2019re seeing really good green shoots in each of these markets. And we still have some upside opportunities in France and Brazil, once we get those opened up as well. Raimo Lenschow : Lovely. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your question, please. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good afternoon guys. Brad, I heard you, you just a few minutes ago talk about good retention 30, 60, 90 days but that was in the attach category. I\u2019m curious as the QuickBook Online customers, I guess, [indiscernible] more broadly. Has they reached their fleet here -- their fleet here in China and then the retention thereafter. I\u2019m just curious if you can provide any metrics or commentary with regards what you\u2019re seeing at the point? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yeah. We share that. Our QBO retention number is in the high 70s and interestingly enough that\u2019s consistent with what we also saw with QuickBooks desktop. We would also tell you that we see some opportunities to continue to improve retention because now we have the ability to see the user behavior and have the opportunity to reach out to a customer, we haven\u2019t seen him log in or if we see them stumbling over a certain part of the product. So we think that number can get even stronger as we look ahead. But right now, it\u2019s in that mid to high 70s in terms of the retention rate for QBO. Scott Schneeberger : Okay. Great. Thanks on that. Just one quickly and\u2026 Brad Smith : Okay. Scott Schneeberger : Neil, looking at next year, it looks like with regard to online at least, a little bit lower share -- show lower share count obviously little bit on the revenue line. So there is a difference on the path to $5 guidance in fiscal \u201817 at least at as we\u2019re breathing on our way there. Could you speak a little bit to the margin profile you see? You can obviously see what it is implied for \u201816 and as we look for \u201817 put and takes there, Neil, is there -- are there any cost saving initiatives undergoing that you may need to be aware of? Neil Williams : Well, there are several things, Scott, there to be aware of. Obviously, we talked about the divestiture significantly. But this also goes back to an initiative really began during this spring. Really looking at all of our discretionary expenses to make sure that they are aligned against the things that are most accretive to growth. And so this includes all of the R&D initiatives, marketing initiatives and things like that. It is not necessarily just moving them from one product or from one business unit to the other but also really measuring the effectiveness. So when asked about our LTV to CAG processed earlier and I could just tell you that we continue to refine and improve, not only looking at the lifetime value of customers but also segmenting the dollars we spend against those and learning which channels and which approaches are most cost effective in doing that. So there is nothing specific that I would talk about at this point. But you should just know that across the company, there is a lot of focus on making sure that all of our investments are focused and concentrated in areas that are really driving customer growth and monetization of the customers we already have. Scott Schneeberger : Okay. Thanks. Just to clarify quickly, on ProTax you guys delivered upon what you said you will this year. Relative to my model, you know, right into next year, is that -- is that maybe just my model. Is there something that has changed relative to your expectation in some material group from fiscal \u201816 and \u201817? Thanks. Neil Williams : Scott, there is nothing that we are -- that I\u2019m thinking of that is changed. And if you take the revenue push out of \u201815 into \u201816 that we\u2019ve been talking about, it gets you pretty close. No fundamental changes in the business that would throw you off substantially. Scott Schneeberger : Excellent. Thank you for clarification. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Brad Smith : Hi Kash. Scott Craig : This is Scott on for Kash. I just wanted to ask about if you implied some details on the international QB -- the percentage of kind of the QBO subscribers from international. And if there is any comment on the attach rates for the payroll and payments. Is there a difference from the U.S. versus other region? Thanks. Brad Smith : Okay. Scott, it\u2019s international for us. We are growing right now. We have 198,000 paid subs. That\u2019s up about 135% over this time last year. It\u2019s primarily coming from the four markets that I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, Canada, the U.K. Australia and India because we\u2019re still very early days in Brazil and France. The attach rates right now, we don't really have a fully build-out ecosystem beyond Canada. So, Canada has payroll and some payments. The U.K., we\u2019ve made an acquisition of the payroll company and so we are attaching there and then in Australia, it\u2019s with a partner that we actually worked with. And so we have a mix of the ecosystem being built out in those other countries. So the attach rates we often refer to are U.S. based. We don't yet provide attach rates beyond the U.S. because we are still early days of building out those razor blades to attach to the razors. I don\u2019t know if I gave you what you were looking for but that\u2019s sort of an overview of the international markets and how it compares to the U.S. Scott Craig : Okay. Thanks. Brad Smith : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your question, please. Kartik Mehta : Good afternoon. Neil, I think in the prepared remarks you talked little bit about margins for the tax business and I thought you said you are not anticipating much margin expansion. I don\u2019t know if you said -- I don\u2019t know if you are expecting any. But is that a reflection of any type of change in competition you're anticipating, change in strategy of new product, or is that just reflection of you trying to get customers and right now, it\u2019s that's where you're investing? Neil Williams : Yeah. Kartik, it\u2019s definitely the latter and the margins are quite healthy in our Consumer Tax business than Professional Tax for that matter. And so we are constantly challenging ourselves to find ways to accelerate the category growth and our share within the category. So, just a reminder, or just a heads up to everyone that we are always focused on trying to grow customers fast than revenue and for our businesses with those type margins. We are always looking to expand the category and we would be willing to take some, be in the low end of the 60s for Consumer Tax for example. If we have some great ideas to really expand the category and accelerate our growth there. Kartik Mehta : And then Brad, I just wanted to get your thoughts after the divestiture you have announced, what do you see in terms of your Mint product and maybe even recent acquisition of Check? Brad Smith : Yeah. Kartik, I\u2019m glad you asked. If you look at the fact sheet and you heard Neil alluded this in the opening comments, we are reporting this Consumer Ecosystem which is now inclusive of Mint, Mint Bills, which is the new brand name for Check and of course, our OFX capability, which basically downloads financial information for banks into all of our products including QuickBooks Online. And the reason why we are reporting in the Small Business segment is because we believe this business has the potential to create a network effect. In a headline today, Small Business has send out over a 1 billion employees whose using QuickBooks a year. They get paid typically with a paper Check in an envelope 48 days later and one of the top three paying points is improving the cash flow. We\u2019ve talked to you in the last couple years about this concept called as Intuit commerce network. Well, we\u2019ve been running experiments with Check and Mint where we believe now that we can solve the consumer side, so that they can use their mobile phone and easily pay their Small Business who will send them an electronic invoice in a matter of days. It\u2019s a delightful experience for the consumer. It obviously gets the Small Business paid right now on average in less than 10 days, which is significantly better than the 48 days. And we\u2019ve started seeing enough excitement there. So that\u2019s why we actually shut down all the other Check channels and said let\u2019s put all of our energy just into QBO. So, we\u2019ve kept Mint and Check because we think it\u2019s solves an important problem for consumers, but most importantly because it also connects with the rest of the Intuit ecosystem and we think we have the potential for a two-side of problem that could be a network effect as it plays out the way we hope it will. Kartik Mehta : And just last question, Brad. We talked about payroll online business and some of the success you are having there. Are you seeing any change in competition and how they are pricing their products based on some of the success you\u2019ve had? Brad Smith : You now, Kartik, it\u2019s always a tale of multiple cities here. You\u2019ve got some of the traditional players that were outsourced players who have added Internet, web-based versions of their products out in the market. We haven't seen a lot of change in their competition. We've seen more advertising, which is actually good for the category because the more people we talk about the alternative solutions that use software, the more our business grows. There are new start-ups, so you\u2019ve heard some of them, good companies like ZenPayroll. Square recently announced that they were moving into the payroll business. So everyone's bringing innovation to the table, but there really hasn\u2019t been anything that\u2019s materially different. It\u2019s just everyone continuing to make it easier for small businesses to pay their employees and to be able to get back to doing what they love, which is actually ruining their business. Kartik Mehta : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Brad Smith : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Sanjay Devgan : Hi. This is Sanjay for Keith. Couple questions. First, on the level of discounting and promotions. I appreciate the guidance of growing customers, faster than revenue. But if relative to maybe fiscal year \u201814 and this past fiscal year, are we looking for similar levels of promotional activity or are we looking to take it to another level in \u201916? Brad Smith : So as you might imagine, we run lots of pricing experiments and test cells to figure out where is the best place to promote our price or promote our products and get the most unit lift. And so we run everything from 90-day sort of trial before you buy to 20%, 40% off over the first six months and we\u2019ve gone all the way as far as offering free services for an extended period of time. I think that\u2019s informs our go-forward plan. We obviously aren\u2019t announcing that right now because competition reasons, we don\u2019t want to let everybody know what our pricing is. But I would tell you that we have done a lot of tests and we feel pretty good about not only the desktop learning we got in the fourth quarter, what is the promotional floor. But on the cloud and QBO, as well as our other products, what the right sort of promotional offers to get the maximum customers to come in and actually get those customers convert versus simply kicking the tires. I\u2019d rather not share anything beyond that right now just because we want to wait until we get into fiscal year \u201916 and we will actually have our pricing out on the website once we do that. Sanjay Devgan : That makes sense. And then looking forward to sort of -- that\u2019s before but attached rates on payroll payments, I realize the rest that we had in the beginning of this year. But what type of attach rates can we get in terms of the level of improvement that makes sense? I think it gets to about 27% or 29% last year before the reset. But in terms of the level of improvement, what makes sense as we think through fiscal years \u201917? Is it 100 basis points a year, would that be conservative enough or, and what will the drivers be for that improvement? Brad Smith : Yeah. I can start with what the total addressable opportunity is. About half of small businesses accept the credit card today. And so I\u2019d like to say that 50% would be the target that we ought to be challenging ourselves to get to in payments. To be fair, we\u2019ve gone from 4% to 6% to 9% to 11% and so it\u2019s going to be a while to get there. And I think our general manager will probably look us in the eye and say, wow 50%, that\u2019s like 100% of the market and our answer would be absolutely. So that\u2019s the mindset we ought to have. We ought to have the best solution to solve the customer problem, better than anyone else and we ought to be able to win those customers, especially if you are using QuickBooks. The same thing will go for payroll and right now, we know about half of the payroll customers today have employees that are W-2 employees. So, you can say, 50% would be a good penetration number for that. I think the payroll general manager would say the same thing to us but I think our mindset needs to be, we ought to have the best payroll and payment solution, especially for QuickBooks customer. And if they\u2019re paying employees or accepting credit cards, they should be using our service. So, lot of headroom to go from 23% to 50% in terms of payroll or from 11% to 50% in payments. I\u2019m not sitting here and telling you that we have a game plan to get there in the next three years but we have a mindset that says we ought to be trying to win every single customer. Sanjay Devgan : Appreciate the answer, Brad. Thanks. Brad Smith : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gil Luria of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Aaron Turner : Hi. This is Aaron on for Gil. When you look at your QBO customers, specifically the ones that are new to the QuickBooks platform, how are they performing? Are they performing more or less then you expected? How is the yield on those? Brad Smith : Yeah. Aaron, I would say that if you look at the software component, is performing very much in line with what we expected and what we would like to see at this point. The but on that relates to a attach services, payroll and payments. We\u2019ve talked about a lot of that already but we just don\u2019t have those capabilities outside of the U.S. but we have here. But if you look at the software itself and the effective rates on that, it\u2019s very much in line with what we expected. Aaron Turner : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Macdonald of First Analysis. Your question, please. Jim Macdonald : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Looking at QuickBooks desktop attach for payroll and payments, kind of the first time it seems like those are starting to decline. Can you talk about that and I know you're pushing QBO, but I would've thought that those customers would either show back up in QBO or be maybe the last ones to go away? Brad Smith : Yeah. Jim, it is Brad. First of all, those customers are staying with us. That\u2019s good news. What we are seeing in the attached services is a combination of two things. Historically, we would sell about 600,000 new QuickBooks desktop customers a year. That numbers now about half of that. And what you find out in terms of attached services is many of those decisions get made in the first 90-days, whether they are going to sign up for payroll and payments. So, one of the things you will see is the attach rate on desktop is getting affected by the fact that not as many new desktop customers are coming in because more are choosing the cloud. The second is in the case of payments, we do have some customers that are large customers that made some payments decision outside the QuickBooks Ecosystem and so that\u2019s a little bit of an effect we\u2019re seeing on payments. But by and large, we see still an opportunity to continue to get tax services in desktop and that\u2019s one of the opportunities we\u2019re pushing ourselves to be better at as we look ahead. But we aren\u2019t losing the customers. In fact, one of the thing that we had accounted on that didn\u2019t happened this year is about 80,000 of the desktop customers that we thought would migrate to the cloud, 80,000 fewer actually did that, they actually stayed on desktop. We can see them in the franchise. We see them using our services and our opportunities to continue to market today and to get them to either move to the cloud or to use additional products. So we see it has opportunity that\u2019s not yet capitalized on. Jim Macdonald : And moving over to TurboTax, I know you don\u2019t want to talk about the core, but you did mentioned the fraud issues? Any ideas of what\u2019s going to be done next year and how effective it will be in terms of solving this big problem? Brad Smith : Hey, Jim. I can say, first of all, I\u2019ve never seen such coordinated collaboration between the federal government, the state government and the collective industry as a whole. I\u2019ve been in Washington multiple times, we\u2019ve all sat at the table, the heads of all the different companies and we have a coalition and our coalition is formed against one common enemy which is the cyber criminals. Our collective goal is to get tax fraud out of the U.S. tax system and we\u2019ve agreed to a set of standards, some data protocol and a frequency of information sharing, so that we can collectively get this U.S. tax system safe and people hopefully will continue to feel good about their ability to file their taxes. None of us at this point are willing to share much more details than that, because we don't want to give any test to the cyber criminal, but we do know that we have a big step forward, but if one year of a multiyear journey we\u2019re going to remain vigilant on that and continue to push on it year-after-year until we see zero in the U.S. tax system. Jim Macdonald : Great. Thanks. Brad Smith : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nandan Amladi of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nandan Amladi : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So to get to the 2 million QBO subs, obviously, there is going to be mix of people are new to the franchise and migrating desktop customers? You made a commentary earlier about 80% of the new subscribers are new to the franchise? So what mix assumption are you making to get to that 2 million number and has that assumption changed as you\u2019ve seen at least this quarter fewer desktop users migrate? Brad Smith : Yeah. I can say that when we originally had anticipated getting to 2 million subs and we provided that as a guidepost to help us think about our shift to the cloud. We had more customers that we anticipated migrating from desktop and less customer that were new to the franchise. This year we had anticipated about 80,000 more desktop customers to migrate and they didn\u2019t. But the good news is more new to the franchise came in which expanded the category and we\u2019ve raised our guidance on subscriber growth and exceeded that revised guidance. So right now, we can maintain the mix we have which is more than 80% being new and less than 20% being migrators. And we still feel confident as Neil articulated in his opening comments in that 2 million subscriber target we put out there for fiscal year '17. So we don\u2019t need to change the mix, if the mix changes, we only see that as upside. Nandan Amladi : Right. And the desktop users that are not migrating, do you have a sense of why they're not migrating? Is the feature clarity which I know was an issue about a year ago, or are there other factors? Brad Smith : It\u2019s a combination of three things. One is features about two-thirds of the customers could migrate today. We still have a product roadmap that will get deeper. Inventory capability built out in the fall and the early part of the calendar year. We\u2019ll have some features like job casting built-in and the ability to migrate payroll data that will appease some of those customers. There\u2019s another group of customers that quite frankly just are locked into inertia, they use desktop for many, many years, they don't feel the need to move, they like the QuickBooks product, they\u2019re satisfied with it. And as long as they\u2019re happy, we\u2019re happy. And then the third is the accountants, and the accountants are increasingly adopting QuickBooks Online and using it. And as they get more comfortable, then they will start to recommend it to small businesses. But some of those accountants today are still test driving the cloud and they use desktop products to do tax returns and other thing. And so until they get motivated and excited and we have to have a compelling reason for them to be excited, many of those small business customers won't move until their accountant tell them to. So it\u2019s those three pieces of features, it\u2019s the small business inertia and it\u2019s the accountant recommending and suggesting they should move over to QuickBooks and we\u2019re working all three of those angels. Nandan Amladi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Can you just -- why you didn\u2019t buyback any stock in the quarter? Neil Williams : Yes. I\u2019ll take that one. Thanks for asking. We were locked out at open market purchases for most of Q4, because we were talking about these asset transactions and thinking about what to do with those. We had a 10b-5 in place. We have a 10b-5 in place. And when I put it in place back much earlier in the year, I was little too conservative with my greed that I put in place, so we were kind of locked out on that end too. We won't make that mistake again and we regret not being in the market much more aggressively in Q4, but we kind of get some mechanical issues that tangle this up. Brad Reback : Great. And just one quick follow-up, since you didn\u2019t write-down any of the assets you\u2019re selling today? Does that imply that you shouldn't take a loss on any of them? Neil Williams : What that implies is that we apply the accounting treatment at the end of this year and we\u2019ve looked at our book value against a range of outcomes that we developed in a relationship with the people helping us market the assets and so, yes, for book purposes you should assume that. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Brad Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith : Yeah, Latif, I would. First of all, I want to thank everybody for your questions today. I know we shared a lot of information. If you take anything away from today\u2019s call, I hope we successfully demonstrated three things that we\u2019re exiting this fiscal year at a position of strength and we have very strong momentum that we are laser focused on accelerating to the cloud in support of our two strategic goal and then we have proven reasons to believe that we can effectively deliver in large and growing addressable market whether they\u2019re in the U.S. or outside the U.S. Again, we\u2019re looking forward to spending a little more time with you and continuing the dialogue and sharing a little more information at our Investor Day on September 17th and until then we hope everybody have a good remainder of the summer. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

My name is Latif, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt Rhodes, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Rhodes? Matt Rhodes : Thank you, very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Intuit's first quarter fiscal 2016 conference call. I'm here with Brad Smith, our President and CEO; and Neil Williams, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2015, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the investor relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. Also, all reported results and guidance, except GAAP EPS, exclude Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken, which have been declared held for sale and reclassified to discontinued operations. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with all that, I'll turn the call over to Brad Smith. Brad Smith : All right. Thanks, Matt, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We're off to a strong start in fiscal 2016. In our first quarter of the year, we grew revenue 17%, and exceeded our QuickBooks Online subscriber and our overall financial targets. While it's still early, we're raising our EPS guidance for fiscal 2016 based on the strength we've seen and the substantial number of shares that we repurchased in the first quarter. We are generating strong new user growth in the online ecosystem. Over 80% of QuickBooks Online customers continue to be new to the Intuit franchise and total QuickBooks paying customer growth was also healthy, as our desktop business posted a strong quarter. QuickBooks Online continues to build momentum. We grew total QuickBooks Online subscribers 57% in the first quarter. This resulted in the addition of over 80,000 QBO subscribers in the quarter, bringing us to 1.159 million paid subs worldwide at the end of October. Roughly 35,000 of our QBO subscribers are using the QuickBooks self employed SKU, which is up from 25,000 last quarter. Outside the US, QuickBooks Online more than doubled, to 215,000 paying subscribers. We remain focused on executing against a compelling long-term growth opportunity. QuickBooks Online has very low penetration, when you consider our total addressable market of more than 65 million small businesses, in our prioritized countries, and more than 40 million self-employed individuals in the United States and the UK. We are encouraged by the continued momentum and the opportunity ahead of us, if we continue to execute well. With that overview on small business, let me now shift to tax. We're looking forward to the kick-off of the upcoming tax season, where our game plan is a continuing focus on driving customer growth and market share. Security will remain a critical priority for us. We're working closely with the IRS, state governments, and the tax-preparation industry to create and deploy a new set of common security standards and data protocols to accelerate the fight against tax fraud. Across the company, we're where we want to be at the early juncture of this new fiscal year, and we remain confident in the long-term growth trajectory, as demonstrated by our share repurchase activity in the first quarter. So on that note, I'm going to hand it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details and our guidance. Neil Williams : Thanks, Brad. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we delivered revenue of $713 million, up 17%. This growth reflects the changes we made to our desktop software offerings in fiscal 2015, resulting in ratable revenue recognition. We also delivered non-GAAP operating income of $46 million, a GAAP operating loss of $29 million, GAAP earnings per share of $0.09, and a GAAP loss per share of $0.11. I'm pleased to report that we had non-GAAP operating income, instead of the loss we typically report in the first quarter. This is a result of our ongoing business model shift, which is driving more predictable and stable revenue streams. Turning to the business segments, total small business segment revenue increased 5% for the quarter. Small business online ecosystem revenue grew approximately 28% for the quarter, as customer acquisition continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 57%, online payments customers grew 4%, and online payments charge volume grew 14%. Online payroll customers grew 17%. Switching to desktop, total desktop ecosystem revenue declined 1% for the quarter. QuickBooks desktop units were flat in the quarter, as we continue to emphasize QuickBooks Online. That said, our desktop performance in the first quarter was a bit stronger than we expected, and as a reminder, our plan assumes units will decline for the year with desktop ecosystem revenue roughly flat versus last year. Consumer tax revenue was the same as the first quarter last year. As you know, our consumer tax business is highly seasonal, and our first quarter is a light one. To help with your modeling, we expect second-quarter consumer tax revenue to be significantly higher than last year, reflecting a shift from the third quarter to the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra weekend day in January 2016. We will continue to invest in the product experience and to prioritize growth in share and customers above margin expansion in consumer tax. Our ProTax group grew revenue more than 200% to $110 million, driven by changes in our desktop offerings, where revenue is now recognized ratably as services are delivered. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect ProTax revenue of approximately $75 million. For the third and fourth quarters, ProTax revenue should be roughly the same as fiscal 2015. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15% over five years. Our first priority is investing for customer growth. We repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares in the first quarter, at an average price of $88.50 per share. We have about $1.4 billion remaining on our authorization and we expect to be in the market each quarter. Our cash and investments balance was $474 million at the end of the first quarter, including $350 million from our revolving line of credit. Our Board approved a $0.30 dividend per share for our fiscal second quarter, payable on January 19. This represents a 20% increase versus last year. And one final note on capital allocation, the process to sell Demandforce, QuickBase and Quicken is going as planned and we expect to complete the divestiture process in early 2016. Turning to guidance, we've provided our guidance for the second quarter in our press release. We raised our EPS guidance for full fiscal 2016 reflecting the stepped up share repurchase activity in the first quarter. We also reiterated our full-year revenue and operating income guidance. As a reminder, we expect to provide a tax unit update in late February, concurrent with our second-quarter earnings release. Our release in February will be a little later this year, based on the way the calendar falls. We'll also provide a final unit update in late April, after the tax season ends. And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith : Thank you, Neil. It's obviously early in our fiscal year, and there's a lot of game left to be played, but we are off to a great start. This past year we made huge strides in increasing our strategic focus, and defining a clear set of company-wide priorities that are designed to make the Intuit ecosystem even stronger. With the shift to the cloud and mobile devices we are growing our categories faster than historical rates. New customers are choosing our cloud solutions, and we're bringing new users into the category, as we expand into new customer segments such as self-employed, and enter new geographies across the globe. The proof points are evident, and the momentum that we're building as the QuickBooks online ecosystem continues to grow at a very healthy rate. We're also gearing up for tax season and looking forward to getting our new offerings out into the market in the coming weeks. As always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and their ongoing focus. And lastly, I want to thank our outgoing Chairman, Bill Campbell, who has been instrumental in moving this company to new heights. Bill has been inspiring Intuit for more than two decades, and it has been a privilege and an honor to serve with him. And with that, we'll turn it over to you to hear what's on your mind. Latif? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brent Thill of UBS. The question please. Brent Thill : Thank you. Good afternoon. Brad, maybe if you could just level set us going into this year's tax season, what you see as similarity to last year, and maybe the things that are a little different? And for Neil, that was an impressive buyback number, I think you bought more stock back in Q1 then you bought all last year. It sounds like you've still got more room to go there. But can you just walk through how you're thinking about the remaining portion, that would be helpful? Thank you. Brad Smith : Okay, Brent. I'll start first. This is Brad, talking about tax season. So what we see is the same is a continued shift towards do-it-yourself software, which you've seen for the last decade, which has been growing mid-single digits, while the assisted methods have been flat to slightly down. We also continue to see an opportunity for us to step forward in our multi-year journey towards our vision of taxes are done. So you're going to see innovation coming out in our products that make it a lot easier and simpler for customer to get the maximum refund in the shortest amount of time. Ultimately, you're also going to see us continue to push towards and you'll see others as well, how to continue to make the Affordable Care Act simple to execute. So far, that has had no impact in the tax industry, and we don't foresee that changing this year either. The last thing I would say is you are going to see the continued competitive intensity that we have witnessed in this category for more than a decade. Lots of competitors, including us continuing to step up their game, which is only good news for the tax payers. What will be different this year I think, are a couple of things. One is just calendar, you heard Neil mention earlier we're going to have an extra weekend in January, so that will shift some revenues around a little bit, but we have tried to articulate that by saying expect a bigger second quarter than a third quarter in terms of last year's comparison, you'll see a bigger second quarter now. The second is, we now have a systemic approach to fighting tax fraud at the federal level, the state level, and all of private industry. We have over two dozen companies sitting around the table, we've been meeting regularly. We have multiple work streams. We have the states and the federal government all collaborating. And we collectively have agreed upon a set of common standards and data protocols. We've agreed upon a set of leads reporting and a frequency of communicating information with the federal and state levels. We've also agreed to more information sharing, so as private industry, we can tune our algorithms into a better job of identifying suspicious activity for the government agencies. And we've also adopted some best practices called a NIST framework, which is basically what the financial services industry has adopted. So a lot of things are the same, continuing innovation, a continued shift to do it yourself software. The changes are the calendar moved a little bit on us, which will simply mean we'll move a little bit of revenue into the second quarter, and you are going to see a more holistic approach to fighting tax fraud, both between private industry and the government. Neil Williams : And so, Brent, speaking about the share repurchase. We think that share repurchase has been a consistent way for us to execute and an effective way to return capital to shareholders. Clearly, we thought the values we saw in the first quarter provided a great return opportunity, well in excess of our thresholds. And so we took advantage of that opportunity. And this is what we talked about in terms of borrowing money for opportunistic reasons, and this is a great opportunity to use our revolving line of credit and take advantage of what we felt like was a valuation situation that did not reflect our long-term plan, and the return we expect to deliver. So we revised our share count for the year to reflect that we do expect to be in the market for the balance of the year, and so we'll see how that plays out. But we like share repurchases. I think it's been an effective tool for us, and we'll continue to use it. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Prichard of Citi. Your question please. Walter Prichard : Hi, thanks. Brad, I wondered if you could talk about the combination of stronger desktop units and also pretty strong US online sub add. It seems like in the past, you\u2019ve had a little bit of a trade-off sometimes between those and wondering where promotions factored in and other things like that, on that strength in desktop? Brad Smith : Yes, Walter. We had talked over the last few quarters that we continue to test what's the right level of promotions, pricing, on desktop while we also continue to drive the QBO subs growth. And I would say in the last two quarters, we've really started to find the sweet spot there. What we've learned is the desktop customers aren't going anywhere, if they're not choosing our cloud solution. At the same time, we started to notice a pattern where they were delaying their repurchase, and looking for promotion or waiting a little bit further into the discontinuation period. So you know they're good for three years using licensed software, and we want to make sure that we give them a reason to move, and make a purchase decision if we have good features or we have something we think is a good opportunity for them. So what we did this last quarter is, in addition to continuing the QuickBooks Online subscriber momentum at 57% growth, we were able to find the right level of activity in terms of price and promotion to get the desktop customers to also to continue to use the product. And I think that's something that we are feeling pretty good about now, because it's not cannibalizing QuickBooks Online, but it's keeping our desktop customers active in the base, and that's a win-win for everybody. And I think that's what you saw in the first quarter. Walter Prichard : And then just to follow up on the security side, when you think about what happened last year and again, sort of something that caught the industry by surprise. How are you thinking about the additional measures that may have to be put in place during tax season, and what impact that could have on just kind of overall unit growth and the inconvenience factor of adding measures like that in, in terms of bringing new self-service users into the base? Brad Smith : Yes, I would say, first of all, the collective industry has a common goal and this is in conjunction with the governments. We want tax fraud out of the US tax system. So we've all agreed to a common set of standards that will make it difficult, no matter which route you go, whether you go to a tax store and you use a CPA, you use do it yourself software. We don't want any corner of the tax system to be vulnerable to someone coming in and trying to do something that's not appropriate. So that's bucket one. And then bucket two is, we continue to make that as frictionless as possible for the end user. And so whether it's Affordable Care Act, which we been able to show we can make something pretty complex pretty simple for customers over the last several years or in this case, using security, we're continuing to lean in to make those innovative techniques, so that it doesn't make it harder for the customer, but continues to protect their information. So I don't think you're going to see shifts moving around because of security, because everyone has agreed to a very common set of approaches. And we're collectively leaning in to get tax fraud out of the system. Walter Prichard : Great. Thanks, Brad. Brad Smith : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Fantastic, and thanks for taking my questions. It's great to see you maintain the strong QuickBooks Online subscriber momentum. But the guidance for Q2 seems to imply significant acceleration, and you are retaining the full year versus raising it. Is there any reason to think that seasonality is different versus your original expectations or anything unique, as we look into Q2? Brad Smith : Yes, Brad, there really isn't. Obviously, we're very excited about the continued momentum, as we just posted in the first quarter. It's still early in the game, and so we want to see a couple more months and potentially a quarter or two here of this kind of acceleration, and if we feel that our guidance as a result of that may be a little too conservative, then we'll update it then. But there isn't anything in terms of seasonality or anything in the balance of the year that would lead us to believe that there's a shift. It's just basically, it's still early in the game, and we want to see this momentum continue before we talk about whether or not we need to be looking at a higher number in our QBO subs guidance. Brad Zelnick : That's fair Brad, that it's early in the year. If I could just follow up on average revenue per customer. Can you maybe share any commentary if you break down the QBO base into its various cohorts, how are things trending there, as we come out of Q1? Brad Smith : Each one of them are moving up and to the right, and so QBO US, continues to get stronger in terms of its average revenue per customer, QBO non-US, the global entities, if you look at the cohort analysis, also continues to get stronger. You have the QuickBooks Self-Employed, which we continue to get more customers signing up for that service, and that's also improving. And of course the desktop business we talked about a few minutes ago. What is happening, obviously is the mix, and as the mix shifts, it will bring the combined average revenue per user down a little bit. But each of the cohorts are actually moving up to the right. And as our teams get wiser on things like promotions and discounts, we just continue to see that as an opportunity to improve. Brad Zelnick : Thanks, Brad. Brad Smith : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your question please. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. On the security front, you answered the revenue question, but what I'm a little bit curious about is how much incremental spend is necessary to put all of these processes and systems in place? And how should we think about that impacting the margins in the consumer tax business through this year? Neil Williams : Sterling, this is Neil. We talked about this last season and said we're going to spend whatever it takes to be sure that we have the absolute best security and privacy features in all of our tax products. You can assume that we've allocated that appropriately, and it's baked into the guidance we've given. We've talked about keeping our consumer tax margin in the 60s, and I'm pretty confident we can spend what we need to spend in that area, and still be true to that profitability goal. We've got some flexibility, in terms of how we allocate costs in that business, and we really started it early in the season last year. So based on what we see at this point, I think we've got things covered within the guidance that we provided. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then my follow-up would be on the QBO side, you talked about the 80/20 split continues as you've seen it. Any new update on the programs and things that you're doing to try to motivate further conversion of the desktop users, the existing desktop users? Brad Smith : Yes, Sterling, it's Brad. So we're continuing to add the feature functionality to QuickBooks Online. This month, we're adding deeper inventory capability that we've been talking to you about, so that'll help us get more product-based businesses in. We think between now and the spring, we'll start to see some of those inventory-based businesses from desktop now have an opportunity to potentially move to QuickBooks Online. We're on a good road map to get job costing, which is another important feature, into the product for QuickBooks Online towards the end of this fiscal year or early fall. That will also open up an avenue for other customers who may want to move to the cloud to move over. And so those, in addition to continuing to work and educating the customer on the benefit of the cloud, and working with their accountant to get them comfortable and recommending it, are those primary methods that we're using, and we continue to see good momentum there. Neil Williams : We've also got the Chooser SKU, that's up this year. Customers who buy a desktop version can try QBO without actually converting from desktop, they can try the two in parallel. So that's another way to give people an opportunity on the desktop side, to try the online product without having to commit all in. Sterling Auty : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nandan Amladi of Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Nandan Amladi : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, the recent QuickBooks connect conference was quite a bit larger than last year, you had a lot more partners at the event. What was the feedback that you got, and how does that influence both your pricing, as well as your road map for the next year or two? Brad Smith : Yes, thank you, Nandan. This is Brad. First of all, for those who don't know, QuickBooks Connect was our customer user conference, and this included not only small businesses, but accountants and third-party software developers. The attendance blew past last year, and last year was an awesome event for us. For those who had the chance to follow, we had keynote speeches from individuals like Oprah Winfrey, we obviously had members of the Shark Tank there. We had Bill Rancic, we had Jessica Alba, and so a really star-studded lineup. The feedback has been incredible. Not only have we gotten great feedback from the developers, we had a Hackathon that occurred, and we had third-party developers showing up with apps that are even much more exciting than we saw last year, and as you saw, last year we had about 500 apps working with the QuickBooks Online platform. Now we're over 1,600 and we think this is just going to fuel that momentum. The feedback from the accountants was incredible. They had the opportunity to learn about important tools. They met as a sub-group for a full day on their own, and they learned from each other, and they learned how to use the tools to make themselves more productive. And the small businesses, I have all kinds of notes for those who actually follow any of the Facebook or Twitter or LinkedIn. You'll see customers posting quotes like, this was life-changing for me. And life changing, because honestly, the things that were shared by some of these keynote speakers, as well as their peers, gave them ideas that helped them get pain out of their life and helped them do more productive things. And so it really was positive, and we expect this to be another catalyst for our growth going forward. Nandan Amladi : Thank you. And a quick follow-up if I might to Neil, CapEx guidance raised significantly. I know you're planning to buy a campus in San Diego. Is that the only major change there, or was there anything else? Neil Williams : That's right. We had an opportunity to buy our campus in San Diego. This is the home of TurboTax and a number of our corporate functions. The campus there was really built to our specifications, and we moved in back in 2007, so the lease was going to come up for renewal next year. And we got an opportunity to acquire the campus at a level that reduces our operating costs going forward, and meets all of our investor growth criteria. So that's the primary cost of the increase in CapEx, and I know we haven't talked a lot the proceeds from the Denali assets, but I would just tell you, that I think we'll more than offset our CapEx plan for this year when those assets are sold. Brad Smith : And just as reference, Denali is code name for the three assets held for the sale, so Demandforce, QuickBase and Quicken, just wanted to make sure, sometimes our internal vocabulary\u2026 Neil Williams : What a code name. Brad Smith : It's all good, buddy. Nandan Amladi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, congratulations on the great start to the year. Two questions from my side. First, Brad, can you talk a little bit about the up-sell opportunities around payroll and online? I did - I think I remember, I asked that question on online last quarter, and you talked about tougher, comps et cetera. But how do we have to think about the growth rates there? And then one question, the other question was on the tax updates. Now that we have eliminated a lot more of the fraud, will there be an issue for us if you compare year-over-year units there that we need to adjust it? So not that we all get a shock when the first update comes and it all looks like the lower numbers? Thank you. Brad Smith : Yes and Raimo let me ask you for clarification on your first question, when you talked about up-sell on payroll and online. Are you asking the question around attach rates for QuickBooks Online for payroll and payments or what specifically would be helpful for you? Raimo Lenschow : Yes. The attach rate, and I think around it the analyst day, we talked a little bit about, you weren't 100% happy maybe with what's going on in payment and any kind of comment around the progress there? Thank you. Brad Smith : Got it. All right. Thank you. So first of all, the attach rates continue to be very strong in QuickBooks Online for payroll and payments. New users attaching to payroll were roughly 21% this quarter. That's optically down a little bit from last quarter, but it's really just the growth of QuickBooks Self-Employed. If you back them out, the attach rates would be pretty similar, it's about 24%. Payments actually increased in attach rate. Up 12% this quarter, up from 11% last quarter, so we continue to get new customers opting in for these additional services, which really bodes well down the road. In terms of the desktop performance in payroll and payments, we have had solid performance in the payroll side. On the payments side, we've acknowledged we've had some execution misses. In particular, as we focus more to the cloud, we've allowed our payments service on the desktop side to become less flexible, and ultimately, we weren't really providing the kind of service to high value customers that we should. Our team has gotten underneath that, and gotten to root cause. We put some good plans in place, and over the last several months, we've seen an improvement there. So we anticipate we're going to be able to stem the tide on the QuickBooks payments side, and we're going to continue lean into the cloud, which is where the growth is. Tax updates and security. Honestly, Raimo, we are collectively as an industry unsure of just what exists in the United States tax system, in terms of fraud. We've been doing our parts and trying to keep bad guys out, and ultimately report anything that's suspicious to the government, who ultimately has to decide whether it's a real or a fraudulent filing. And the IRS has historically not been able to share any information back with us, until recently as a result of this summit, where they've got approval now to begin to do information sharing with private companies. So I think we're all collectively just going to have to navigate through this. But I think what you're going to see is if there is any reset, it will be system-wide. It won't necessarily be company specific. It will be everybody who will start to see a change, and we'll do our best to try to explain any of that if that happens. But right now, we're just excited, everybody's lined up against a common enemy, which is cyber threats. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. That's really helpful. Brad Smith : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much. And congrats from me as well. Brad, I had a question on the desktop QuickBooks product. Flat units is obviously a lot better than the trends you saw last year, but it does sound like you still expect those units to trend down. I had a question on pricing. Can you just outline what you're doing on pricing on the desktop product this year, both what you've done so far, and what you maybe plan to do, if you plan make any changes that needs to be? Brad Smith : You got it, Ross. Thanks for the question, and thank you for the feedback on the quarter. So let me start first with the desktop unit. As we just reported, we did have a stronger quarter than we had originally forecast. We aren't at this point going to bring our original guidance -- we're not going to change it, but if we see another quarter like this, then we're going to need to rethink whether or not the desktop is going to decline as quickly as we thought. And that's only good news for us, because that means more paid QuickBooks customers, both in the cloud and desktop. So right now, I would tell you that we're treating this one as a welcome set of good news. And if we continue to see this good news, then we'll talk to you about whether or not the desktop will continue to decline at the rate we originally forecast. In terms of pricing, it's really -- it's more strategic pricing, QuickBooks enterprise, we were able to take the price up, and that continues to show strong unit growth, as well as revenue growth. In the QuickBooks Pro and Premier line, we have found that promotional discounts to get the customer to basically come in and go ahead and make the purchase are working well for us, and they're not cannibalizing QuickBooks Online. So I'll give you an example. If we promote around $199 in QuickBooks Pro, we actually see good strong unit lift, and that's incremental to the overall revenue, and it does not cannibalize desktop, or excuse me - it does not cannibalize QuickBooks Online. So net-net, it's really just getting smarter about the pulse promotions that we work with retail channels, and we've been raising price where it makes sense, like QuickBooks Enterprise, and that collectively is adding up to the strength you saw in the first quarter. Ross MacMillan : That's great. And just a quick follow-up on the international QBO add, should I view that number really as telling me that you'll be selective about the quality and/or the ARPU of the international adds that you are targeting now? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes, Ross, that's exactly the way we are looking at it. So we love the strong growth continuing, it's more than double, 110% up to 215,000 paid subs. However, we've seen some opportunities that we think we're going to continue to refine. For example, in India, we've taken the price up, and as a result, that's had a modest impact on the subs growth, but we're getting a much higher revenue per customer, which we think makes sense for the long term. We've also sold some things like in Canada, where we were selling QuickBooks Online in a box at retail, we had already pulled that out of the United States because we didn't like the attrition rates it was causing, and we started to see similar patterns in Canada, so we pulled back on that as well. So it's really just getting refined thinking around what is the right price in each of these countries, while continuing to sustain strong subscriber growth, and that is what you saw show up in our non-US numbers. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much. Brad Smith : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Macdonald of First Analysis. Your question please. Jim Macdonald : Yes. Thanks, guys. How is your new finance offering going at where you're going to help small businesses get loans? Brad Smith : Yes, Jim, it's good to talk to you. QuickBooks Financing is going incredibly well right now. We've been able to facilitate over $250 million worth of loans with qualified lenders and qualified small businesses. We have good demand from alternative lenders and banks coming in and wanting to connect to the platform, and we're seeing customers actually get approved in a matter of hours, and so we like the early results of this, and we're going to continue to lean in. Jim Macdonald : Okay. Great. Could you just explain again the quarterly impact for TurboTax? I guess I didn't hear it properly. Brad Smith : You want to take that one, Neil? Neil Williams : Sure. First quarter this year, Jim, is about the same as last year. What we've signaled here is that we think the quarterly - for second quarter is going to be significantly higher than we had last year. It's going to be a pull in from Q3 because we got a few more weekend days in January for the tax - in our second quarter this year than in the past. If you go back a ways and you look back to 2012, and some of those early years, you're going to see a little more -- a slight seasonal shift, we think, into Q2 from Q3. Still going to be the same guidance we talked about for the full year, but we're anticipating now a little more in Q2, a little less in Q3. Jim Macdonald : Okay. Thanks a lot. Neil Williams : The last couple of years have been a little more skewed due to unusual situations that at this point, we don't see coming up this year. Brad Smith : So Jim, that headline that Neil hit on there was fiscal year '12 was probably a pretty decent proxy in terms of seasonality. So for those out there looking at the models, if you kind of go back to fiscal year '12, that\u2019s probably a little more like what we anticipate. Neil Williams : Exactly. Brad Smith : Yes. Jim Macdonald : Got it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gil Luria of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Gil Luria : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. There was a little IPO today, Square, it's a partner and then sometimes a competitor of yours. And they've raised a couple of interesting questions in how they approach this strategy in terms of decisions you've made and are making. One is, they have this strategy of using payments as a razor, and trying to sell other products such as payroll, for instance, as a razor blade. That's something that you decided a year ago not to do. Could you get into why you don't think that worked as a model, and why you just made that decision? And then, you brought up of the $250 million of small business loans that have been made off your platform. Again, they have already, in just a few short months, extended even more credit than that, based on the fact that they have the visibility into the revenue, and access to the payments to these merchants. You have access to the entire set of financials through QuickBooks, and then you've been serving this ecosystem for a very long time. Why not accelerate, or why are you not accelerating the growth of that business. What are the things that are making you grow at the rates that you been growing, as opposed to you trying to accelerate the QuickBooks financing option? Brad Smith : Yes. Thanks, Gil. First of all, we are excited to see Square's success coming out. They're a good partner for us. It's good news for small businesses. Over half of small businesses still don't accept electronic payments. The more players who get into this space, get small businesses looking for new solutions. And of course, we want every one of these payments providers to work with QuickBooks. And so that's why having them as a partner is good news for small businesses, because their data flows seamlessly from their payments into their accounting. And it's good news for us, because it makes QuickBooks Online the operating system that small businesses all depend on. So we're wildly excited about their success and pleased to hear the results. In terms of their approach to payments as a razor, and then opening up to other blades, that's not unlike our own approach. We just happen to believe, and we already have a center of gravity called small business accounting, where people get money in and money out. They either have to accept the money or owe somebody money, and that happens to be called accounting. And with that, we have razor blades like payroll, payments, and other services, including third parties. Why we chose not to go the route of payments being the open door was quite frankly, our payments products was not architected to unlock into another product. We've been working on that with QuickBooks, excuse me, the QuickBooks payments Go Payment product is now working with QuickBooks Online, and so if you come in with Go Payment, we want to have you be able to unlock into accounting and other services. So we think the strategy makes sense. It just happens to be for us, we believe the center of gravity, the operating system is small business accounting. The other piece was financing, and the honest answer is why are we not ramping as quickly as maybe Square did, is because we chose not to. We were in test mode, we were in beta. We were testing the quality of lenders. We were testing whether or not we could get the lowest rates for small businesses, and we wanted to make sure the Net Promoter score was superior. As we started to see those things all go green in the direction that we wanted, we started to open up the throttle. So we haven't been in the market as long or as aggressively. We have been talking to you about it, as it's been in test mode, but we've just recently said, this is exactly where we want it to be, and we're leaning in. So I think you're going to see this continue to ramp. Gil Luria : Got it. Then a quick follow-up on tax. I know these are the very small quarters, the last couple of quarters are the really small quarters, but you grew 8% during the season. The last couple of quarters have declined. Again, I realize they are very small quarters, but is there anything to call out as to why the last six months of results in consumer tax are down year over year? Brad Smith : No. In fact, if you look at the total numbers that get published by the industry overall, whether it's competitors or it's what comes out of the IRS, there's been no shift in share, there's been no shift between methods. There's nothing that's happening out of the normal. It just happens to be every year sometimes people file their taxes on time, sometimes people file their taxes a little bit later, and we just want to make sure that in the absolute universe, that we are continuing to hold or gain share, and right now, we're seeing that happen. Gil Luria : Great. Thank you very much. Brad Smith : Okay. Thank you, Gil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good afternoon. Neil, I know you spoke to the CapEx change in an earlier question, but could you talk a little bit to when the purchase of the San Diego campus, is that all - is all the money outflow going to be in fiscal '16? And did I hear that it sounds like you may be selling your other three business units sooner than later, and that may reduce the CapEx absent the San Diego purchase? Neil Williams : Hi, Scott. First of all, we - it looks like now we'll close on the San Diego campus in January. And so, yes, all the money will flow out on that, whatever that transaction is completed. We don't have a date set yet, but I would expect it to be in the second quarter, probably in January. As far as the sale of the three businesses, Demandforce, QuickBase, and Quicken, those are actually on the track that we set out back when we announced this back in August. And so will it be in the second quarter or early third quarter. I'm not sure at this point, but I can tell you we're making good progress on them. And we haven't talked explicitly about the proceeds we expect to receive in those businesses, but suffice it to say I think it'll be well above our total CapEx outlay for this year. So, I can view that as offsetting the money we're paying out. And by the way, the money were investing in this real estate is going to be a help for us in our margin expansion in the later part of this year and next year, too. So, should come within a few months of offsetting the cash in and cash out. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks. And as a follow-up, just on ProTax and consumer tax, on ProTax first, when we look ahead to fiscal '17, should we look at a similar quarterly cadence, as you've just provided on this call for fiscal '16? And then, on consumer tax, you mentioned you are looking for similar margins with -- someone asked on fraud spend, anything different on marketing spend, timing, or magnitude this year? Thank you. Neil Williams : Yes, Scott. The cadence you see for ProTax for 2016 ought to be the right cadence for next year. All the changes we made to the products and to the way we deliver those services for this year ought to track right into next year, so modeling ought to be very similar. Brad, do you want to speak to the marketing on consumer tax? Brad Smith : Yes. Happy to do that. Scott, we're continuing to focus on effectiveness, and that will actually drive efficiency. So in terms of the marketing campaigns, our whole category - our approach is to expand the category and continue to gain share, and do that by empowering taxpayers to know that they are more capable than they may think to do their own taxes and get a great outcome. In terms of the dollar spend, we aren't looking to increase that dollar spend year over year, but to get a bigger bang for every dollar we do spend and I really like the plan that the team has in place, and we're looking forward to the tax season and kicking off here in a couple weeks. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks very much. Brad Smith : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good evening, Brad. Just on the tax side, do you anticipate anything different in terms of pricing or maybe products from your competitors? Brad Smith : Kartik, every year, we continue to anticipate the most competitive environment that you can imagine for tax, because it's been that way for quite some time. So my anticipation is that all of our competitors, like us, will continue to put innovation into their products, to make their products easier for taxpayers, and I think the pricing will continue to be competitive. I'm not sure we can get more competitive than zero, absolute zero and free, which is where we've been, but I certainly would be prepared for a very competitively intense tax season, and quite frankly, that won't be new, that will not be unique to this year. Kartik Mehta : You talked about the ACA and obviously, you have a product to help consumers with that, but it seems like the key is going to be communicating to the consumers that they can easily finish their tax returns using your product. And I'm wondering, you talked about not spending more on marketing. Is it that you're just going to allocate more to communicating about ACA, or do you think that is not necessary, and you'll just do your normal marketing about the product itself? Brad Smith : Well, I think the good news here, two parts on ACA. We shared with you last year that one of the highest conversion portions of TurboTax.com was actually the Affordable Care Act section, where people who came to TurboTax.com to get questions answered. They could use the free tools that we had to help them figure out their income or their subsidies due, or their potential penalties, and then they converted right into the product, which takes us to marketing. And right now, we're in the neighborhood of having almost 100 million people in the United States, out of 150 million, already coming to TurboTax.com. So it's not about getting even more people to the website, it's about getting more of that 100 million roughly between the US and Canada to convert into paying customers. So for us, it's about doing our job better. Continuing to make our products easier to use, and helping people get the questions they have around the Affordable Care Act answered, and that's why you hear us saying that we think we've got the right tools. We think we have the right marketing mix, and it's going to be a matter now of getting in the season and trying to match those words with the results. Kartik Mehta : Thanks, Brad. I appreciate it. Brad Smith : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open. Brad Smith : Michael, are you there? Operator : A moment, we are trying other line. Mr. Millman, your line is open. Michael Millman : Thank you. Is that working, hello? Brad Smith : It is. Michael, we can hear you. Yes, we can hear you. Michael Millman : Okay, sorry. On the fraud work that you've done, lots of people think that the EIC was -- at least a lot of it related to EIC filers. So wondering to what extent do you think the changes will either reduce some of it, not only reduce some of the fraud, but reduce some of the actual EIC filing. To what extent do you think it might push some of that filing away from do-it-yourself to assisted. And I also have a question regarding what Ryan is pushing to do in terms of simplification that might have more legs than a typical political talk. To what extent do you think your mobile solutions will benefit from that, or to what extent might the whole industry lose some momentum regarding a Ryan policy? Thank you. Brad Smith : All right. Thank you, Michael. You got some good meaty questions in there, so we'll try to take them one at a time. Let me talk about earned income tax credit, which is a very important subsidy for a deserving group of taxpayers out there. It's unfortunately been a very complicated area. There was a lot of testimony actually covered in the Senate Finance Committee on September 30, and if you get the chance there's a public link out there that will allow you to hear the points of view of leading senators from all around the nation, as well as those people involved in the GAO which is the controllers, the US Comptroller's office. But in a headline, we have seen no shift and no aggressive growth of Earned Income Tax credit in our DIY business. It's basically grown in line with e-filing overall. So the data that we see does not suggest there's been a shift of Earned Income Tax credit from one model to another. As you know, we are in the assisted business with our ProTax products, and we're in the do-it-yourself business with TurboTax. With that said, we are collectively as an industry looking to get rid of tax fraud in all of its shapes and forms, and so we are running experiments with the Department of Treasury as we speak. And we're trying to run experiments to say how can we continue to make sure that people who deserve earned income tax credit can get those subsidies, and how do we make sure that no bad guys can get into that system and try to defraud the system. And I like some of the pilot work we are doing, and we're sharing that across the industry as well. So the net-net on this is, it's going to be hard to know until we get into the season, whether we are collectively being successful in stopping Earned Income Tax credit fraud. But I would encourage you and anyone out there who has a question about whether there is a shift between assisted or do it yourself, to go look at the link that the Senate Finance Committee actually debated for quite some time, around this earned income tax credit, because you will hear facts out there as represented by the government, that would help everybody understand how we're collectively trying to line up and fight this. The second piece was around Ryan's simplification efforts, the house speaker, and in a headline, we are for tax simplification. We have been from day one, quite frankly, that's what our business is. Trying to take a complicated tax code and make it simple for people to comply with, and to be able to get their tax obligations done, and obviously, to get the money back in their pocket if they overpaid. It will be very hard to tell whether this is the year that something happens or not, but we hope so. Because at the end of the day, the simpler it is for the tax people to file their taxes, the more willing they're going to say, maybe I can do this on my own, and we think that only bodes well for the do it yourself category overall. And so, we're hopeful that something will happen. At the same time, if it doesn't, we're in the job of simplifying it for the consumer, and that's what we're going to continue to do. Michael Millman : Thanks, Brad. Brad Smith : Thank you, Michael. Operator : And gentlemen, I'm not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith : Yes, Latif, I would, thank you. And I want to thank everybody for your questions. Obviously, we're off to a strong start, but we have plenty of game left to be played. We're looking forward to the upcoming season, both the peak period in tax, as well as the continuation of QBO and our small business ecosystem. We want to wish everybody out there a safe and happy holiday season, and we're looking forward to talking to you soon. So thanks for the questions, and we'll speak with you next time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.+",

(Broker) Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Latif and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal 2016 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt Rhodes, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Rhodes? Matthew Rhodes - Vice President Investor Relations : Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Intuit's second quarter fiscal 2016 conference call. I'm here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO; and Neil Williams, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2015 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP to non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period. And the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. Also, all reported results and guidance except GAAP, net income and EPS exclude Demandforce, QuickBase and Quicken, which have been declared held for sale and reclassified to discontinued operations. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you, Matt, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We are out of the gates strong in the first half of fiscal 2016. We grew revenue 23% in the second quarter, exceeded our guidance across the board, and we're on pace to deliver against our full-year outlook. Now we know tax is on everybody's mind at this point in the year, so let me start there first. Overall, our tax strategy is on track. We are focused on expanding the do-it-yourself software category while driving customer growth and share gains, particularly in the simple returns segment. TurboTax Online units grew 12% through February 20, with total units up 9%. We're growing our accepted e-files season-to-date faster than the category, which implies that we're once again taking share. Our growth is being driven by product innovation, as we continue our journey to reimagine tax preparation. This year, TurboTax expanded its data import capability in pursuit of taxes are done. Approximately 75% of taxpayers will be able to digitally import W-2s directly into the product this year, up from 68% last year. TurboTax securely imports tax information directly from more than 1.4 million employers and financial institutions, saving considerable time and improving accuracy for the taxpayer. This season, all mobile and online customers can snap a photo of their W-2, and TurboTax will import the information into their tax return, whether they are on a phone, a tablet or a computer, which also saves time and reduces errors. Our TurboTax SmartLook feature is resonating with customers. This new feature quickly connects users with TurboTax experts who will answer the questions in real time, completely free. And for the second consecutive year, Americans with more straightforward tax situations are able to use TurboTax to file both their federal 1040A or 1040EZ returns, as well as their state returns, for free. This is a highly compelling offer for those 60 million Americans, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck and count on their tax refund as the biggest check that they'll receive all year. I am really excited about our pace of innovation. While there is plenty of time left on the clock, if you look at the scoreboard so far, you'll see that IRS data through February 19 shows that self-prepared e-files were up about 3%, contrasted with assisted e-files being down 5%. And as I mentioned earlier, our e-file growth and other third-party data indicate that we're gaining share so far this season. Looking beyond TurboTax Online, our TurboTax desktop units are roughly flat, and the data suggests we're gaining share and winning back customers who may have gone elsewhere last year. On the ProTax side of the business, we've seen positive early trends in customer acquisition and returns growth as well. As I always say at this time of the year, it's early in the season for our tax businesses, but I like the strong start that we've delivered so far. We're staying agile, and I'm very pleased with our products and our customer experience. Now let's talk small business. We continue to generate strong new user growth in our online ecosystem. Over 80% of QuickBooks Online customers were new to the Intuit franchise once again this quarter. Total QuickBooks paying customer growth was also healthy in the quarter, as our desktop business posted strong results as well. QuickBooks Online continues to build momentum. Total QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 49% in the second quarter. This resulted in the addition of nearly 100,000 QBO subscribers in the quarter, bringing us to 1,257,000 paid subs worldwide at the end of January. Roughly 50,000 of our QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed, which is up from 35,000 last quarter. Outside the U.S., QBO subs grew roughly 80%, to 230,000 paying subscribers, which is in line with our expectations. We remain focused on growing customers globally. We've built good momentum in the UK, Australia and Brazil, and we recently went live in France. We continue to get smarter as we expand our global footprint. We're tuning the local game plan in each country to achieve our targets for lifetime value versus customer acquisition costs. Near term, this is dampening subscriber growth a bit in India and in Canada, but we have clear plans in place to drive healthy, profitable growth in these two markets over the long term. Finally, our expanding QBO ecosystem gives us confidence that growth will remain healthy. 85,000 accountants who use the accountant version of QBO also have at least three clients using QuickBooks Online, that's more than double the number of accountants with at least three clients versus last year. And we now have over 2,000 apps that integrate with QBO in our marketplace, which is more than double the number we had a year ago. 13% of QBO subscribers are now using a third-party application, up from 8% 12 months ago. We know that retention of a QBO customer who also uses a third-party app is better, which increases lifetime value. The QBO subscriber growth remained near 50% this quarter, so we remain confident in our full-year outlook as well as the outlook we gave for fiscal 2017. In fact, we saw QBO subs growth during the last month of this quarter become a peak for us and that is a good news story because that is the peak season for adding QBO subscribers. As a result, we're raising the low end of our QBO subscriber outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year. The range is now 1.475 million to 1.500 million subscribers. Now, as a reminder, at Investor Day, we shared our expectation that QBO subscribers would grow better than 40% on average between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2017, and that would enable us to exit fiscal year 2017 with between two million to 2.2 million subs. Given this quarter's performance, we remain absolutely on track to deliver against this longer-term outlook. So when you hit the total key, it's been a strong first half of the year : I'm inspired by our teams' commitment to reimagine the tax prep experience in both our consumer and our professional tax businesses. And there's much more innovation in store from these teams over the next few years. And in small business, customer growth remains strong, as we continue to focus on global customer acquisition, enabled by our cloud solution. So with that overview, I'm going to turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details. R. Neil Williams - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we delivered revenue of $923 million, up 23%; non-GAAP operating income of $114 million, versus a loss of $22 million a year ago; GAAP operating income of $42 million, versus a loss of $89 million; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.25, versus a loss of $0.06, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.09, versus a loss of $0.23 last year. These results reflect the changes we made to our desktop software offerings in fiscal 2015, resulting in ratable revenue recognition from that point forward. Turning to the business segments, total Small Business segment revenue increased 7% for the quarter. Small business online ecosystem revenue grew approximately 23% for the quarter, as customer acquisition in our online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 49%. Online payments customers grew 5%, and online payments charge volume grew 17%. Online payroll customers grew 17%. I know some of you have been tracking QBO subs in the product itself. You should be aware that due to a one-week lag in the data, it's not always a good indicator of where we will land for the quarter. You also have to consider variability from marketing and pricing tests, seasonality and other data and timing issues when looking at the subs number. Our second and third fiscal quarters are our strongest seasonally, as accountants drive adoption during tax season. Switching to desktop, total desktop ecosystem revenue increased 3% for the quarter. QuickBooks desktop units increased 14% in the second quarter. Our strong desktop performance was driven by our pricing and promotion strategy. And for the full fiscal year, we expect desktop ecosystem revenue to be up slightly versus last year. Consumer Tax revenue was up 29% versus the second quarter last year. Consumer Tax revenue is significantly higher than last year, reflecting a shift from the third quarter to the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra weekend day in January this year. We still expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% for the full year. We're focused on execution for the remainder of the season to grow the category and expand our share. Our ProTax group revenue grew to $84 million, driven by changes to our desktop offerings, where revenue is now recognized ratably as services are delivered. For the third and fourth quarters, ProTax revenue should be roughly the same as it was in fiscal 2015. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15% over five years. We repurchased $455 million worth of shares in Q2, and $900 million remained on our authorization as of the end of the quarter. Our cash and investments balance was $334 million at the end of the second quarter. On February 1, we secured $1.5 billion in debt financing, including a $1 billion revolver and a new term loan of $500 million. One strategic use of this debt was the purchase of our San Diego campus, which we've previously discussed. Other potential uses include share repurchases and acquisitions that closely align with our strategic priorities. Our board approved a $0.30 dividend per share for our third fiscal quarter, payable on April 18. This represents a 20% increase versus last year. And one final note on capital allocation. We expect the process to sell Demandforce, QuickBase and Quicken will be completed this fiscal quarter, with total proceeds of approximately $500 million. We expect to report GAAP-only gains when these sales close. We provided our guidance for the third quarter in our press release. We also reiterated our full year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance. As a reminder, we expect to provide a final TurboTax unit update in late April after the tax season ends. And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you, Neil. We're pleased with our performance in the first half of the fiscal year, and based on these results, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the back half of the year as well. Now we recognize that the macro environment looks choppy. But if you look back over the three-plus decades as a company, it is during uncertain times that our products are needed most by our customers. They still need to file their taxes, pay their bills, and look for ways to stretch their hard-earned dollars as far as they can. And we've never been in a stronger position to serve our customers. Over the past several years, we've transformed from a North American desktop software company to a cloud-driven, global product and platform company, and that heavy lifting is now behind us. That's why we're continuing to play offense, investing in innovation to fuel customer growth. We have lots of opportunity in front of us, and we remain deeply committed to accelerating both customer and revenue growth. But it all starts with great people. And as always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and their ongoing focus. On the subject of great people, as a part of this earnings release, we announced the decision to rotate the general managers in our Consumer Tax and our Small Business units following the tax season. Effective May 1, Sasan Goodarzi will take over as the head of the Small Business Group and Dan Wernikoff will assume responsibility as the general manager for our Consumer Tax business. This commitment to leadership mobility is consistent with Intuit's historical practice. As we accelerate our transformation to a single ecosystem, strengthening and developing senior talent to possess a deep understanding of all aspects of the ecosystem is more important than ever. Intuit's future success centers on our ability to solve important two-sided interactions in ways that deliver tremendous benefits for both sides. This rotation will enable Dan and Sasan to develop deep empathy for each of Intuit's core customers, as well as a better understanding and an appreciation of our collective products and technologies across the company. We're able to implement leadership moves like this from a position of strength. We've built deep talent benches, we developed great momentum and we have clear visibility into strong outlooks in both Small Business and Consumer Tax. I'm excited to watch that momentum continue as Sasan and Dan bring a fresh perspective and a new set of capabilities to their respective teams. So with that, Latif, let's open it up and let's hear what's on everyone's mind. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats to your great second quarter. Two quick questions. First, you talked about the desktop numbers being better and driven by price and promotion, but we also saw better unit numbers there. Can you talk a little bit about the trends there? And then the second question was on the QuickBooks Online ARPU. If I do a calculation there, this was the second quarter where ARPU actually started to go a little bit higher. So the question is, are we on the trend back upwards again, or do I need to be aware about other drivers here? Thank you. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thank you, Raimo. This is Brad. So let me start with desktop units. The good news is we've been able to continue to drive strong QBO subscribers, 49%, and over 80% of those are new to the franchise, while also growing our desktop units 14%. And what we basically learned is last year, we had tried to raise the price on desktop from $199 to $249 and we thought that might accelerate the migration to QBO. That didn't happen. In fact, we didn't see migraters accelerate. What we did see, though, is upgraders in those that were using existing desktop delaying their purchase. So throughout the balance of last year, we tested $199 price promotions, and we saw really strong results. What we saw was it had no impact at all on QBO. There was no cannibalization, but what it did do was it incented people to actually upgrade to the newer version. And so what you're seeing happen now is we have the ability to continue to accelerate QBO. Continue to get existing desktop customers to move up to the newest versions, and that's the best of both worlds. And so that's what's happening with desktop units, and as you heard we plan to \u2013 we actually anticipate the desktop units and revenue will be up slightly for the year now. The second question was on QBO and average revenue per user. As you know, we shared at Investor Day we're solving for total revenue growth and subscriber growth, and our targets are 25% to 30% in revenue, and then about 40% subscriber growth and that will get us to the targets we provided for fiscal year 2016 and 2017. I will say, however, that we do see opportunities for ARPU to continue to accelerate over time. If you remember, we talked about a first year customer comes in with a period of time where they have a trial and a promotional price. Once they move into the 13 month on the product, that ARPU goes up for that customer about 50%. So as more of these new customers start to age, we see a natural tailwind in ARPU. And, of course, we continue to get smarter in how we do attach services like payroll and payment. So we do see upside opportunity down the road. But for us, ARPU is really an output metric. We want to stay focused on total revenue growth and customer growth and then over time, we think by executing well, ARPU will improve and we'll give you an update on ARPU in the next Investor Day. But we don't tend to focus on that on a quarterly basis. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Very clear. Thank you. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of UBS. Your question, please. Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Brad, you mentioned the share gains that you're seeing early out of the gate here. I'm just curious if you could help everyone understand where you're seeing those share gains, and perhaps maybe where you think there's more room where you feel that you could be doing better on tax? And for Neil, could you just talk maybe a little bit about the attach of payment and payroll? And it looked like on the payment side, was a little bit lower than some had thought. Can you give us a sense of what may be dragging that down? Thank you. R. Neil Williams - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks, Brent. This is Brad. I'll take the first one on share gains. So with the IRS data being published through February 19, they are showing that total returns received were down about 1.3%. They're suggesting that the self-prepared returns, the do-it-yourself category is up about 3% season to-date and the assisted downside. If you do all the translation and machinations of that that would suggest that the do-it-yourself category has picked up a little more than two points of share from assisted so far. Now, in the back half of the season, we'll see assisted get a little bit stronger as more complex returns come in. But the good news is, the DIY category continues to take share from assisted. And then the question is, what about TurboTax share inside that category? And let me say, we have not seen this strong of market share advances at this time of the year in my recollection. And I've been here for a while. So right now, season to-date, we're a little over 3.5 points of market share, and we're seeing market share increases in TurboTax Online. We're seeing market share increases in TurboTax desktop at retail, and we're also seeing an increase in the number of Free File Alliance customers using TurboTax. So it's across the board. And then your question is, where can we do better? Well, we're always constructively dissatisfied. But I have to tell you right now, I feel really good about the product innovation the team has put out into the market. I love the reaction to our advertising and our marketing campaign. I love the fact that we've taken a leadership role in fighting security, our cyber fraud is leading security efforts across the industry. And, of course, we have opportunity to continue to make sure we're answering phones faster. There's places in the product we always want to make easier for end users, and the team's all over that. But by and large, I feel really good about our TurboTax execution so far. R. Neil Williams - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And so, Brent, moving to your attach question, there are really two things that are in fact there in play. One is the seasonality of the business. If you look back at the same quarterly trends from 2015, you'll see that Q1 is a high point for us. Attach rates tail off a little bit in Q2. Probably the bigger factor though is that we're including the self-employed units this year in the numbers, and they were very small last year in Q2. And those are typically earlier businesses, self-employed, sole proprietors, who don't have the same attach opportunities as our other QBO base overall. But those are the two main things to watch to understand the attach rates and payments in Q2. Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open. Steven Michael Rogers - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. It's Steve Rogers on for Walter. Just wanted to see what you guys were seeing with the overall growth in the tax market with returns being down. Maybe if we could just start there. And then also, with fraud, just do you think that's playing a factor in the market growth year-to-date, or is it just seasonality? Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thanks, Steve. It's Brad. So what we see every year is the tax business is always hard to predict in terms of total returns filed. There's macro trends that you can go back and look at over a decade where there's just more procrastination. As tools become easier to use, people's 1099s and W-2s tend to come out a little bit later, they tend to wait a little further into the season to file their taxes. And so that's been one thing that just continues, and it has been doing that for the last 10 years. The second is, the good news is with the IRS data that came out on through February 19, this past week, looks like returns actually went up about 3%. So even though we got out to a slow start, it brings the total season to date down to about 1.3%, below prior year. So I think you're starting to see momentum pick up. The question behind your question and I heard you ask it was fraud. I think collectively, we as an industry and the government are absolutely making an impact on fraud. Now whether or not that actually is correlated with the number of filings that have been filed so far, we won't know until the end of the year when the IRS and the states actually tell us how many of the returns were fraudulent. But I can tell you right now, we have collectively linked in, we've added 23 data schemas and protocols. We've strengthened the passwords, we've added opportunities to share information at a federal and state level between the private industry and the government, and we are starting to adopt a framework called Knit, and I think all of that is having an impact and that is good news for all of us. So, right now, I think the season is still playing out and I think it's just a combination of procrastination, and then we'll see how much of it ends up being having an impact on fraud. Steven Michael Rogers - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Sanjit Singh in for Keith. I wanted to toggle back to international QBO and get a sense of what's driving some of the deceleration there. It sounds like you guys took pulled back a little bit in India and Canada. I wanted to see what your thoughts were longer-term in those two countries, and what are you seeing outside of Canada and India? What's your traction in the UK, Australia, maybe Germany? Your sort of outlook on the international side? Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Sanjit, this is Brad. I would say first of all, overall, we feel very good about our global progress. And I mentioned the countries. the UK, Australia, Brazil where we made an acquisition last year of a company called Zero Paper and now we've just ported that under the QBO platform in February. And of course, we opened up France. And overall, it's up 80%. We have over a quarter of a million paying subs, a lot more in the pipeline in trial periods and kind of using the product, so that looks very healthy. I did mention the two countries you wanted me to drill deeper on, Canada and India. I'll start with Canada. Canada is about 30% of our global units today. And what really impacted its growth rate this quarter is, last year, we had tried a test of putting QuickBooks Online in retail stores. You would go and purchase it just like you would a box. You would come home and then you would activate it hopefully. And while that drove subs, we did not like the retention rate. In fact, we saw attrition was higher in that particular channel. We ran a similar test in the U.S. So we didn't feel those were good quality leads. We didn't think that was a good effective cost to acquire customer, so we pulled that out this year, and we have a little bit of a grow-over on that. But the underlying health of the Canada QuickBooks Online business is strong. We simply have pulled out a channel, and now we're going to have to grow over it. India is a little different. To be very candid with you, our product in India we had more work to do to get it compliant. We've now added two scrum teams of engineers. We've also pulled back on marketing just through the accountant channel and we're starting to go more direct to small businesses. And so that one's in a little bit of a pivot. I feel really good. We have 1,000 engineers that work in our India development center and they are all passionate about helping get QBO localized and we have a lot of good end market knowledge. We're simply in a reset mode there. It's small enough part of our mix, it's the perfect time to learn the lessons and to get readjusted, and we are committed to both Canada and to India over the long term. We're just in a matter right now we're making adjustments to the channel in Canada and we're making sure the product is compliant in India. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And one quick follow up on sort of payroll attach and payment attach. Other than including QuickBooks Self-Employed in sort of the denominator, is there anything that you're seeing in the market that's sort of changing your view in terms of what type of attach rate you can ultimately achieve? Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. In fact, we're still seeing healthy performance there. The numbers, 21% of all new customers attach in payroll, 8% this quarter attach payments, now that's because of the seasonality thing that Neil walked through. But when we actually look at the penetration rates and the opportunities for customers that come in, we managed the cohorts, the 90 day cohorts. We feel real strength in attach opportunities. And so there isn't anything in the external market. This is just a matter of us being able to execute quarter-to-quarter, and continue to get smarter each time we move forward. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Brad, a couple of tax questions up-front. This delay in the IRS start, looking at what you would deem ACA returns versus non-ACA returns, are you seeing that as anything characteristic in just one of these procrastination years and maybe late forms? Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Scott, we honestly just don't see any impact of ACA on any customers' decisions, whether it's which way they choose to file their taxes, or when they choose to file their taxes. It continues to be a very high converting area for us on TurboTax.com. This year, as you know, about 90% of tax filers, whether they last year qualified for a 1095-A, and this year they got a 1095-B or C form, which is a form that they need to have to basically say that they have insurance, it hasn't had any impact. You can see we came out of the gate strong. And so, we're seeing on the ProTax side of the business, where we have an assisted method, similar trends. We see good healthy start to the season. So, we don't see any impact from ACA, and we don't think that that's what's causing any sort of IRS delays from our perspective. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. And then, just a follow-up still on the TurboTax category. Two separate questions, the desktop strength in TurboTax, if you could elaborate that? And then one additional, the volume and revenue relationship for Consumer Tax growth this year. Obviously you're trending quite well in volume right now; maintain the guidance for the year. If you could just address the relationship as you see the year play out? Thank you. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks, Scott. So on TurboTax desktop strength, as you know, we learned a pretty tough lesson last year. We had made some product changes in the early part of last season that honestly angered our customers. And last year we gave them the $25 difference in what they would have been able to get for a Deluxe product versus what it required them to move up to Premier. And we made a promise we would return the desktop product lineup features to the way they had been. And we did that this year. We kept our promise. And we had an aggressive campaign to go out against any customer we thought that we might have lost to a competitor. And quite frankly, our data shows that we're getting them back. In fact, our conversions from our competitors are up 3X in the desktop business. Our share is up a couple of points in retail. And the net promoter in the desktop business is up 13 points year-over-year. So I think this is about us learning a tough lesson. We made a mistake. We recovered well from it, and our customers came back and said, great, we're back with the TurboTax again. In terms of volume relationship, our goal is always to expand the category and then to grow customers faster than revenue, because as you know ultimately, over time, those customers tax situations will become more complex. And over multiple years we can maximize the lifetime value. So, right now, we're seeing good solid growth in units as you heard us report today, 9% overall and 12% in TTO, TurboTax Online. And while we're still maintaining our guidance of 5% to 7%, we really like the trends so far this tax season, and we think that that ratio will continue to play out with more units coming in faster than revenue through the balance of the season. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Brad. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital. Your question, please. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Brad, I had a question just on the QBO adds. So it was a good number, ahead of your plan. When I do the mix, I think the kind of core domestic, ex self-employed were actually down a little bit year-over-year in terms of net adds. That's the net you \u2013 and I was just curious, you run different promotions, there's different ways for you to manage that. How do you think about that net add number? And there's, I guess, the real question is, is there anything that we're bumping up against in terms of a limit on how many domestic, what I call core non-self-employed adds that you could add each quarter? I'd love your thoughts. Thanks. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks, Ross. We'll start with \u2013 we feel good about the overall QBO adds. We certainly had a couple of countries outside the U.S., Canada and India, that I just spoke to, but by and large the international businesses are doing really well. And we like our momentum in the U.S. In fact, we just crossed one million active paying customers in the United States, which is a major milestone. In terms of opportunity ahead in total addressable market, there's about 29 million small businesses in the U.S. If you back out the self-employed, you're still looking at the neighborhood of between eight million and 12 million, and we currently have one million that are using QuickBooks Online. So we aren't running out of any sort of opportunities to grow. It's just a matter of us continuing to lean in and execute. And we're seeing improvements in our Net Promoter Scores. We're seeing a lot of good traffic coming to QuickBooks Online, and we're seeing improved conversion rates. So I \u2013 from a quarter-to-quarter perspective, as Neil said, you have some seasonality that kicks in. Sometimes small businesses come in one quarter and then the next quarter you may see a little bit of ebb and flow. But overall we feel good, which is why we've raised the low end of our guidance and we're reaffirming our 2017 outlook. We really like the momentum. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And one follow-up just on the desktop side. Has anything changed in terms of how you think the desktop business will play out over the past to 2017 and 2018 given that you're starting to see unit growth again? I know there's a sort of price dynamic, but I'd love your thoughts around how you think that plays out medium-term. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Ross, I think we started to get wiser about our multi-year outlook last year, and we shared it with you as, the good news is, we're getting more of our QuickBooks Online users that are new to the franchise, which means we're expanding the category. We were getting fewer customers from desktop to migrate over, but since we're talking about lifetime values and profitability that are pretty equivalent in both sides, we just want to make sure they stay with us; they don't go anywhere else. But one of the things we learned last year is by raising the price to $249, we basically had customers staying but not renewing on their desktop and they weren't moving to QBO and that was actually a lose for us. And so our promotional pricing now basically says, we're going to keep those people who want to stay on desktop at least active, continuing to buy from us and use the newest version and get the best product, and we're going to continue to lean into QBO. And I think what you see happening overall is the best of both worlds. I think ultimately you're going to see a portion of customers still on desktop in 2017, 2018, and I would go all the way out to 2020 and further. There's just a group of people that are going to want to stay on desktop. We want to make sure they're using the most recent version and continuing to buy from us while we continue to open up the category with QBO. And so I think that's the only difference to our outlook as we hope to have more active customers on desktop while we continue to add new users in QBO. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks again. And congrats on the strong start to the tax season. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey. Thanks, Ross. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our final question for the session comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thank you. So, more on tax, to what extent do you think that the reduced growth industry numbers on do-it-yourself is caused by the slow pick-up in returns? Also, kind of following up on Scott's numbers questions, has there been a change, and to what extent in the ratio, yours now, free versus paid? And maybe you can give us some idea of where the California suits on racks stand, if they're still going on? Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Mike, I'm going to ask you to repeat your first question because I'm not sure I got the essence of it, which was you said reduced growth due to slow pickup... Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Yeah. IRS numbers show reduced growth, as you said it was up 3% this year, last year, was up 6.7%. So there's been reduced growth. Do you think that early on was a consequence of the slower refund pick-up early in the year? That was the first question. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Got it. I got it. And I got the other two. Thank you for clarifying, Michael. I appreciate it. So, right now, it's hard to describe because none of us really know. It's only conjecture is why are the number of returns being filed with the IRS down 1.3 season to-date? And we all have hypothesis, but the good news is we know that come April 18, and yes, there actually is an emancipation day this year. So instead of April 15 being the day, since it happens over the weekend, everyone has until Monday, April 18. And so the good news is people are going to have to file their taxes by the end. So what we look at is the ratio with how many you're shooting to send the taxes then through a self-prepared method versus assisted. And we really like the fact that right now, season to-date, 2% of the total market are leaning more to self-prepared than they are assisted. So I think it's probably a safe assumption to say any year-over-year comparisons are probably driven by the fact that just fewer people so far have filed their returns versus last year. But the good news is the ratio of people leaning into do-it-yourself versus assisted continues the trend we've seen for the last 10, which is more people are filing taxes on their own now than going to somebody to do it for them. In terms of changes in free and paid, we have had a really strong campaign for two years in a row in Absolute Zero. And as you saw last year, not only did it drive unit growth and share gains, we actually exceeded our revenue guidance last year. So there's a monetization model behind that that we're super excited about. This year in terms of mix, free is up a couple of points more than it was last year and that's in alignment with our guidance. And so we feel very good about the free to paid mix. And honestly, we feel even better about our monetization this year because we've learned a lot from last year's program. So I'm feeling good overall about free to pay. On California racks, I actually \u2013 good news is we have our General Counsel sitting here. So Laura Fennell, is there any update we have on the California situation? Laura A. Fennell - Secretary, Executive VP & General Counsel : We don't, right now. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. I guess that was a clear attorney answer. We don't. So I don't have anything to share for you there, Michael. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Do you have any target dates as to when something will occur? Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : On that last question, on the California situation? Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Yes. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. We haven't been notified by anyone in the industry, and so we don't have any knowledge of what's going on there. No. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Appreciate it. Thanks, Brad. Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you, Michael. Appreciate it. Operator : Gentlemen, as there are no further questions, would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad D. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Latif, thank you. I want to thank everybody for your questions today. As you can tell, we're encouraged by the strong start and momentum we've built up. I have to say we're really competitive, so we're looking forward to the remainder of tax season and our fiscal year. But we are feeling quite confident in our full year outlook. And so I want to thank everybody and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Take care and have a great afternoon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating.

My name is Latif and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt Rhodes, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Rhodes? Matt Rhodes : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Intuit\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2016 conference call. I am here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO and Neil Williams, our CFO. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2015 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. Also, all reported results and guidance, except GAAP, net income and EPS, exclude Demandforce, QuickBase and Quicken, which have been sold and reclassified to discontinued operations. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brad Smith. Brad Smith : Alright. Thank you, Matt and thanks to all of you for joining us. As you already know, we had an outstanding tax season. We are also pleased with our performance in Small Business. At the company level and our fiscal third quarter, we came in ahead of our guidance across the board. And as a result, we are raising our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for the year. Since tax is on everyone\u2019s mind, let\u2019s start there. We feel great about the product innovation that we delivered in TurboTax this year as well as the result enabled by that innovation. As you know, there are four key drivers to our Consumer Tax business. The first driver is the number of returns filed with the IRS. The latest IRS data indicates that total returns were up about 1.5%. That was a bit stronger than we expected, so it was a modest tailwind. The second driver is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. This season, the category grew nearly 6% versus the assisted category, which was up only slightly. This suggests that do-it-yourself software category gained more than a point of share again this year, driving more than 3 points of revenue growth for TuboTax. The third driver is TurboTax\u2019s share within the do-it-yourself software category. For the third consecutive year, we gained share within the category. In fact, this season, we gained more than 3 points of share bringing our total software category share to roughly 65%. And the fourth driver is revenue per return. As you know, our goal is to grow customers faster than revenue, which yields a positive lifetime value payoff after tax situations grow more complex over time. Our strategy to gain share of the less complex returns continues to bear fruit, enabling unit growth of 12% overall, which was faster than our revenue growth of over 9%. With that said, revenue growth for the segment far outpaced our original outlook of 5% to 7% at the beginning of the fiscal year. Bottom line, it was a very successful tax season for TurboTax. So what drove the performance? The answer is simple, an awesome, innovative product experience. But what\u2019s behind the awesome experience is not so simple. It is driven by deep data science and rigorous execution from a very talented TurboTax team. Now, we began this multi-year journey 3 years ago to re-imagine the tax breadth experience, in support of a brand vision of taxes are done. And this season, we began to really see it pay off. We remain committed to continuing to invest and build on our competitive advantage, driving share gains for the category and for TurboTax. This season, our team more than tripled its pace of innovation, introducing over 20 new products improvement. We coupled this product innovation with a great demand generation campaign that really resonated. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to do your taxes. We made the complex simple, which when you get down to it, is what Intuit does everyday. Our seamless cloud-based experience drove increased mobile discovery and usage. Our mobile app downloads were up 85% versus last season and the number of completed returns through the mobile app and through mobile browsers doubled. This year, customers snap 5 million photos of tax documents with mobile devices. That is up 4x greater than it was last year. This represented 25% of all the documents imported into TurboTax, which save time and reduce errors while delighting customers. We also continue to re-imagine the entire product experience using data to help customers finish their taxes faster with increased confidence. For example, we broke down the Affordable Care Act into simple questions and provided new confidence building features like explain why and smart look. These innovations helped reduce the tax spread time by 40% on average for our customers. We also delivered an excellent customer care experience and continued to invest in security, working with the industry and the government to protect our customers and to reduce fraud. On top of all of that product improvement, we continue to focus on serving an important segment that we feel is underserved and overcharged, the Simple Returns segment. Absolute Zero gives these taxpayers the most affordable option, a great product that cost them nothing. But Absolute Zero was just one of the reasons that we won this year. In fact, TurboTax gains share versus software competitors who matched the Absolute Zero offer and we even gained share at the end of season at full price. All-in-all, TurboTax grew unit double-digits and expanded share. We also grew revenue more than 9% and we improved margin in an already very profitable business. This was simply a great season for TurboTax. Now, let me shift to the ProTax business, which we recently re-branded as the ProConnect Group, given the strategic role this business plays in our ecosystem. The ProConnect Group supports both of our strategic goals to do the nation\u2019s taxes and to be the operating system behind Small Business success. In support of doing the nation\u2019s taxes, we are doing just that. We grew individual returns about 1% in this business this year, which is faster than the overall assisted category group. New customers were a bit soft, but we did a nice job with retention leading to modest customer and return growth. Looking ahead, we are focused on growing the ProTax business in ways that are less reliant on price. We are leaning into the cloud with Intuit Tax Online and we are innovating with new attach solutions, like refund transfer and e-signature. We have got some work to do to drive faster adoption in these services, but we are optimistic about the future. The new name reflects ProConnect Group\u2019s expanded efforts to support Small Business success. The more we connect our accountant customers with our Small Business customers, the more successful they all our and the healthier our ecosystem becomes. For example, we know QuickBooks Online retention is 11 points better when a Small Business works with an accountant. So, we are tapping into our accountant network to make these connections. Nearly 600,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers are now linked to an accountant. That is up 70% versus last year. This all nets out to a strategically important, highly profitable business, albeit with a slower growth rate than TurboTax with a Small Business group. Neil will talk more about our expectations in this business in a minute. With that overview on the tax side of the house, let\u2019s transition to Small Business. We continue to generate strong new user growth in our online ecosystem. Again this quarter, more than 80% of QuickBooks Online customers were new to the Intuit franchise and total QuickBooks paying customer growth remained healthy. Year-to-date, across desktop and online, new customers are up 16%, which is an acceleration from last year. QuickBooks Online continues to build momentum. We grew total QuickBooks Online subscribers 45% in the third quarter. This resulted in the addition of 140,000 QBO subscribers in the quarter, bringing us to 1,397,000 paid subs worldwide at the end of April, which was ahead of our guidance. Roughly, 75,000 of these QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed, which is up from 50,000 last quarter. Outside the U.S, QuickBooks Online grew roughly 60% to 255,000 paying subscribers. In total, we are executing well and we are on track to meet our subscriber targets for fiscal year 2016 and 2017. Also it\u2019s important to note that revenue per customer is coming in a bit stronger than we expected so far this year. As we said at Investor Day, we are expecting to land at 2 million to 2.2 million QBO subs at the end of fiscal 2017. Now we are also improving customer retention and we fully expect retention to continue to improve next year as more of our QBO customers are acquired through or worked with an accountant. Attach of payroll payments and third-party apps also improves retention and we are building solid traction there as well. For example, we now have over 100,000 QuickBooks Online Accountant customers who have at least three of their own clients on QBO. That\u2019s more than double what it was a year ago. We now also have 2,500 third-party apps in our ecosystem. That\u2019s up from 1,100 a year ago and approximately 15% of QuickBooks Online customers are connecting to at least one third-party app. That\u2019s up from 9% a year ago. Payroll and payment as you know were drivers of retention and they also help drive revenue per customer and the attach rates for these products remain healthy at 19% per payroll and 8% for payments. So that\u2019s the story of the high level. Our teams have driven significant innovation across all of our offering and it\u2019s resulted in strong financial results for the quarter and for the year. So with that, I am going to turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details. Neil Williams : Thanks Brad and good afternoon everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we delivered revenue of $2.3 billion, up 8%. This growth reflects the shift of approximately $30 million of consumer tax revenue from Q3 into Q2 relative to last season. We delivered non-GAAP operating income of $1.4 billion, up 11%, GAAP operating income of $1.3 billion, up 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.43, up 20% and GAAP earnings per share of $3.94, which reflects an after tax gain of $0.67 per share on the divestiture of Quicken, QuickBase and Demandforce. Turning to the business segments, total Small Business segment revenue increased 12% for the quarter. Small business online ecosystem revenue grew approximately 24% for the quarter as customer acquisition and our online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks online subscribers grew 45%. Online active payments customers grew 6% and online payments charge volume grew 18%. Online payroll customers grew 17%. Switching to the desktop side, total desktop ecosystem revenue increased 8%. QuickBooks Desktop units were up 3% in the third quarter and for the full year, we expect desktop units and revenue will be up slightly. I know it\u2019s been difficult to correlate the growth rate in QBO subscriptions to our online ecosystem revenue growth rate. Here are some details on online revenue that should help with your modeling. In the third quarter, online payroll revenue grew 21% and online payment revenue grew 13%. About 40% of our online payroll customers are attached to QBO while 60% are not. We saw standalone online payroll through partners and accountants. This is a good profitable business, but one that grows much lower than payroll attached to QuickBooks online. The revenue mix is closer to 50-50. We expect payroll customers attached to QuickBooks Online to grow around 25% this year and revenue from those customers to grow nearly 40%. Now let\u2019s look at payments through the same lens. The customer and revenue mix for attached to non-attached solutions is about 50-50, but the story is a little different. We are not currently focused on standalone payments channels, like GoPayment and online processing that are not attached to QBO. The QBO attach business is growing very fast and the non-attach business is shrinking. We expect payments customers and revenue attached to QuickBooks Online to grow more than 50% this year. Consumer tax revenue was up 7% versus the third quarter last year. And for the year, we expect consumer tax revenue growth of approximately 9%. As a reminder, third quarter consumer tax revenue reflects the shift from the third quarter to the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra weekend day in January this year. One thing I would like to call out as we start thinking about next season and next year\u2019s guidance. We are investing to improve the total TurboTax product experience, thus delivering the results you saw this season. This remains a high margin business at over 60%. We remain focused on growing customers, gaining share and increasing profit dollars rather than margin expansion. Our ProConnect Group, professional tax revenue was $126 million in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect ProConnect revenue to be approximately the same us in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As Brad said, we are focused less on price on the ProTax side and investing in our accountant offerings to enhance growth in the QuickBooks Online ecosystem. We expect revenue to be roughly flat in fiscal 2017 with margins remaining above 60%. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15% over 5 years. We have repurchased for $465 million of shares in the third quarter and we have $435 million remaining on our authorization. Our cash investment balance was $1.6 billion at the end of the third quarter and our Board approved a $0.30 dividend per share for our fiscal fourth quarter payable on July 18. This represents a 20% increase versus last year. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $2.5 billion in cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. We provided guidance for the fourth quarter in our press release. We also raised our full year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance and now expect revenue growth of 11% to 12% for the year. We have reiterated our full year fiscal 2016 guidance for QuickBooks Online subscribers. As we look forward to fiscal 2017, we are pleased that our trajectory is in line with the long-term customer and financial plans that we shared last year. Small business and consumer tax remain quite healthy. We will continue to invest in awesome products, security and customer care. The investments we are making outside the U.S. will pay off over the longer term horizon. Taking all this into consideration, I still believe that $4.30 is the best estimate of where non-GAAP EPS will come in next year. We will share more when we provide fiscal 2017 guidance in August. And with that, I will turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith : Thank you, Neil. In a headline, we are having a great year. Customer growth is as strong as it\u2019s ever been in small business and TurboTax and our accountant facing teams are driving adoption and health across the ecosystem. We are further penetrating large addressable markets and we remain deeply committed to accelerating customer and revenue growth. Now before I close, I would like to share a few words about our dear friend, Bill Campbell. Personally and professionally, Bill\u2019s larger than life persona, his colorful language, his brilliant and his leadership stretched from coast to coast. Respected by all as the coach, his influence shaped men and women from football fields to corporate Board rooms and to his table at the Old Pro Sports Bar in Palo Alto, California. He was indeed one of a kind and well built can never be replaced, he will always be remembered. So with that, let\u2019s turn it over to you to hear what\u2019s on your mind. Latif? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Thanks. I know you get this question a lot on desktop versus online, but I am wondering if you could maybe walk us through some of the factors that you saw in the April quarter that drove again growth in desktop and maybe online sub is a little lower than we were expecting, although pretty much spot on, just trying to understand is there anything new going on there as we got through the last three months? Brad Smith : Yes. Walter, it\u2019s Brad. Thank you. First of all, we would tell you the important thing to think about is that desktop and online are not a zero sum gain. In fact, what we are doing is we are expanding the total addressable market. And I know that I have had a couple of shareholders ask me questions about the fact sheet we used to report years ago that included the number of desktop customers that run the last 3 years version. We don\u2019t report that anymore. And so there was a question of hey, is that number actually decreasing faster than online subs are growing and are you losing customers? So I will tell you what, we will share some information at this moment that actually is subs that we used to publish. So, everyone has got the same data. If you take the total number of QuickBooks desktop customers and look at the ones that are on the last 3 years version, these are the active customers and then you add that to the online subscribers and the desktop subscribers, the total base is up 4%. That is the first time that base has grown in over a decade. If you then take that number and say, how many actually paid us this year? They either bought a version of desktop in the last 12 months or they got a subscriber, subscription promise. That number is up 20%. And then if you look at total new users, whether they bought desktop or online, that\u2019s up 16%. So no matter how you cut it, the headline is we are expanding TAM. We are growing our base. We are entering new markets. And we feel very good that both the desktop and the online business are growing. And time to desktop, the thing that we discovered is what we talked about on the last call. We have a group of customers that even with feature parity and even with pricing concessions do not want to move to the cloud right now either because their accountant isn\u2019t yet in the cloud or the Small Business just likes the product the way they have it and they don\u2019t want to make the move. We want to make sure they remain active customers of Intuit and that they are buying payroll and payment services, so we want to keep them delighted. So, we are making sure that the desktop customers are happy. The cloud customers are happy. And that those who want to move over, we want to make it easy for them to do that. So net-net, we have a very vibrant ecosystem right now. It\u2019s growing in total. And the online subs for us, actually was right on our expectations. I felt great about 45% growth. I feel good about the momentum we have in the countries outside the U.S. And most importantly, I love the facts we are expanding TAM, both new countries as well as self-employed, which give us a lot of runway for the future. So, that\u2019s how we felt about the QuickBooks business overall. Walter Pritchard : Got it. It sounds like math shouldn\u2019t have taken that automatically. On the international side, could you just update us on how you are thinking about sort of customer acquisition costs versus kind of lifetime revenue in some of the international countries? It seems like to us, there is a varying degree of competition in some of the markets you have entered in the last year or 18 months? Brad Smith : Yes, I can. As you might imagine, it\u2019s a country by country story. So in each country, we have the different set of strategic outcomes. We fundamentally believe that certain markets right now we have a real advantage and we have momentum and we are going to invest to win in that market. In other countries, we know that we are moving in and we are the second placed player. And so we want to be a challenger in that market and for every specific country, Neil and I have sat with the country managers and we have agreed upon an LTV to cap and it\u2019s a multiyear target. So, we actually have where should we be a year from now, 2 years from now, 3 yeas from now? In some cases, we pushed that number a little further out for strategic reasons. In other cases, we say we think we can get the profitability a little bit sooner. But it truly as a country by country formula and make no mistake, we see a lot of upside and the number one focus we have is expanding TAM and accelerating customer growth, because we know lifetime value will come over time. We just want to mature we are doing that prudently with the right cost to acquire. Walter Pritchard : Okay. Thanks, Brad. Brad Smith : Alright. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Keith Weiss : Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. If I may, one question sort of on tax and one question digging in on the flipside of the equation. On tax, again, a very good year of market share gains. As we think about sort of rolling forward, any reason to believe in terms of perhaps stuff that you saw from your competitors, structural things within the marketplace that these share gains shouldn\u2019t be sustainable on a going forward basis, some pretty big numbers there? So, perhaps it\u2019s just a lot of large numbers, but any reason that why we shouldn\u2019t be extracting that on a going forward basis on the tax side? Brad Smith : Okay. And Keith, did you want to put your second question out there? Keith Weiss : Sure. So, I will put the second question out there as well. So, on the QuickBooks Online side of the question, if we just look at the numbers from face value of where you guys are expecting to get to at the end of FY \u201816 and then look at we are expecting to get to at the end of the FY \u201817. It does seem like you need to see an acceleration in quarterly net sub adds into next year. So, the question is are we looking at that right? And if so, what causes that acceleration sort of the bigger number of a quarterly sub adds into next year or are there other factors in play the improving renewal rates or the like? Brad Smith : Got it. Thank you, Keith. First of all, thanks for the feedback on the quarter. Let me talk to tax first. The results you saw this year are the results of a multiyear investment we have been making in product and innovation, which is not easily matched by competition. I mentioned a couple of things in my opening talk track that even though we had success with Absolute Zero, we also had success when competitors matched Absolute Zero and we were head to head and we took share and we also had success after Absolute Zero was done and we were at full price. What\u2019s happening right now was we are really making big advances towards taxes completely going away and having no friction for customers to get to the refund. And you heard me talk about this year on average customer spent 40% less time having to do their taxes. That is not stuff that competition can match. Now at the same time, I will tell you we have a lot of respect for our competition. We don\u2019t underestimate them when we know every year is going to be competitive. But do I believe that the same can continue to advance our product innovation and as a result, continue to win more customers and take share? I do. That\u2019s the expectation we have of ourselves and that\u2019s the expectation we want to deliver for our customers as the product basically get them closer to taxes were done. So, said another way, I don\u2019t buy the law of large numbers in our case. We are going to continue to work hard to get at that number. The second is QBO an acceleration, you are right, for us to deliver the 2 million to the 2.2 million subs growth, you are going to continue to see an acceleration in terms of the net adds we bring in on a quarterly basis. We fully know that and we continue to reinforce our confidence in that. And you may ask why? Well, remember, one of the things we talked about when we gave that forecast is we needed to have total subs growth on a 40% compounded annual growth rate. Well, this quarter was 45%. The second thing is, while we have made some adjustments outside the U.S. and Canada and India, we have got a clear path of how to get those countries repositioned in a good way. UK and Australia are on fire and we just brought on two new countries, Brazil and France. And so we believe with the expanding TAM and the fact that were early innings in both self-employed and global as well as the fact that the U.S. grew in the mid-30s, we see our way to the 2 to 2.2. We are not batting an eye and your math is correct, we think that is doable. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you very much, guys. Brad Smith : Alright, Keith. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hey, guys. Congratulations on the tax numbers on the consumer side. My question is more on the QBO side, I would have granted that you guys have been putting up very good growth in QBO sub base, I would have thought that the attach rate of payroll and payments, which quite healthy at 19%, 8%. But I would have thought that those businesses should be growing even faster and it\u2019s little surprising, but your QBO based business, although it\u2019s larger than payroll and payments, it\u2019s actually growing faster and adding more new dollars than the other two businesses. Can you help us understand when could we see that inflection point where the attach rate starts to inflect pretty materially that you could realize your growth objectives, which I am sure are pretty aggressive with respect to payments and payroll? It seems to me there is something limiting these attach rates from going potentially very high. I am sure that you have thought this as much as anybody else, but I just wanted to get your perspective. Thank you. Brad Smith : Yes, Kash, thank you. I would say, first of all, at face value, the one thing we have to keep in mind is we have a growing base of self-employed customers on these QBO numbers. And so those self-employed customers by definition don\u2019t have employees so they don\u2019t need payroll. And many times they are driving for Uber or somebody else and they don\u2019t need payments. And so if you actually look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, our tax rate remains very healthy compared to where it was a year ago. At the same time, we do see opportunity to continue to improve the attach rate. We are focused on first use, making sure we reduced the friction and the customer experience and continuing to get those services available outside the U.S. and the non-U.S. countries, which will allow us to bring that penetration and that attach rate up for the total base. So, you are correct, we do think that there is still opportunity there. We are working on it hard. That one of the things you have to look at right now in the absolute numbers is keep in mind that last quarter, we had 50,000 QBO self-employed. This quarter, we have 75,000. And that number doesn\u2019t come with payroll and payments opportunities today. And so that basically makes the attach rate put the way they do. The other thing I would say about the ability to improve the revenue, the ecosystem in addition to attach is obviously, we have shared with you in the past, we have customers that come in that first year on a promotional pricing period. When they hit the 13th month, that average revenue per customer for that unit goes up about 15% and we are going to have customers rolling off that promotional pricing period and that\u2019s going to help us bring revenue up. The last piece I will add, so in addition to attach rates and moving off of promotional pricing is retention. A year ago, we have been talking to you about attention in the low to mid-70s. We now talk to you on QBO about retention in the high 70s and starting to tickle the low 80s. And every point of retention adds the net 15,000 subs. And so that number is also a lever that we continue to improve and we have improved significantly over the last 12 months. So those are the piece of cash, I know there is a lot of math in there. Those are the pieces that kind of lead us to the confidence we have in the actual online ecosystem revenue. It is attach rates. It is retention and it is rolling off the promotional pricing. Kash Rangan : Got it. And it\u2019s all very Adobe-esque and very positive. Brad, if I could sneak in one, what would be your longer-term objective for payroll and payment attach rates on your QBO ecosystem? That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Brad Smith : Yes. Kash, I appreciate the feedback and the compliment comparing us to our friends here in the valley. We have a lot of respect for them. This is one of those mindset things. It\u2019s hard to management to say what is the limitation, so we actually look the number of people that are paying, employees and saying we should have 100% of them that are using QBO. And how many are accepting credit card and we should say hey, we should have 100% of them. We know right now about have of small business accept payments and so we think that number is a good aspirational goal somewhere between here and there is reality. But right now, I would hate to limit our potential by putting a number out there that our employees think is okay, the best we can be. Payroll for us is typically we say about 40% to 50% of desktop customers. Since right now, our QBO feature functionality is a little more service oriented, I would somewhere in the 30 to 40 is a sort of the near-term, but I think over time, you are looking at half of the base using payroll as well. Kash Rangan : Wonderful. Thanks so much Brad. Brad Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of UBS. Your question please. Brent Thill : Thanks. Brad, just on QBO, you raised the full year guide, but you reiterate your goal and I think there are a few investor questions about the deceleration of growth, especially outside the U.S. where the growth rate is still obviously very healthy, but decelerating very quickly, so if you could just put that into context of your targets on QuickBooks Online where you feel like you are hitting, are you getting the stride that you would like to hit, you mentioned some of the reorganization in the process in India and in Canada, how long will that take to stabilize to help that base grow again? Brad Smith : Yes. Brent, I would be happy to do that. I will start with, it was just a short time ago in the fall at Investor Day when we remove the original target of 2 million subs, which was the original outlook for 2017. And we raised it to 2 million to 2.2 million. And we said hey, that\u2019s a new your goal and that was about nine months ago, not even nine months ago. And then from there of course, we have been accelerating. And so to do that, we have to deliver 40% plus CAGR. And we have been above that number. And so we actually are achieving the outcomes that we set for ourselves internally. Now along the way, we have had some learning. One was Canada, as you know we found out that we were selling units through retail and then they weren\u2019t retaining at the levels we expected them to and so we shutdown that channel. I would tell you that Canada pivot is now behind us and the momentum is rebuilding in Canada and we feel very good about the Canada outlook right now. The other area was India. And India is where we didn\u2019t take the time to localize the product and get all the compliance features of the levels that accountants would have confidence to recommend it. As a result, they were recommending our product in conjunction with another product and it was becoming a companion app. We did not want that to be the brand and so we have now stopped that. We have actually been finalizing the product, localization and we are now starting to go direct to small businesses while we are getting back out to accountants and let him know the new version. That one is not as far along as Canada, but we are already seeing the progress in India as well. The last two are the new countries. Brazil, which has now afforded its acquisition we did a year ago called ZeroPaper, reporting over on to QBO and we are starting to accelerate there. And then France, we just did general release. So when you put that together U.S. remained strong, self employed is opening a new market. Canada is back on track. India has made its turn. Brazil and France are ramping up and UK and Australia remain gain busters. And so we feel good about our 2 million to 2.2 million. I understand there is a little bit if you have to have faith and confidence if you would just take a look at what we delivered so far. But I hope that that we can demonstrate through the first quarter, the second quarter that we are going to be on track to deliver those numbers because we certainly feel good about them or we wouldn\u2019t reiterate the guidance. Brent Thill : Okay. And Neil, you got out to a really good start early on in tax, were you able to accelerate any investments this quarter that maybe you want to put in that you got more confident that you could put in given the trajectory of the tax business out of the gate? Neil Williams : Brent, we have been testing product experiments all along the tax business. I can tell you we invested everywhere we saw a favorable payback. And you see that with the unit growth we have had this year. We didn\u2019t leave any investment dollars on the shelf. You can rest assured with that. And we think as Brad said, this is a multi-year journey. And so there are more things that we want to do next season and we made some investments this season, I think it will pay off next year as well. Brent Thill : Thank you. Brad Smith : Thanks Brent. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much and apologies for the background noise. I am at an airport. Brad, I had a couple of questions, congrats from me on the tax season as well, great effort. I actually had two questions on QBO. The first is, when we look at the core U.S. subs ex international and self-employed, the net adds has sort of flattened a little bit here in the last couple of quarters. And I am just curious, as we think forward especially towards the 2 million to 2.2 million goal, would you expect that the core domestic sub adds would sort of reaccelerate again or I would love your sort of thoughts around that. And then second question is, you had QBO announcement and we talked about the QBO, kind of importance of the accounting channel, maybe you could just restate the importance there, it sounds like it has implications for churn and other aspects here, so I would love to get your quotes or color there? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes. Thank you, Ross. And no problem on the background noise, I know you are a busy man out there traveling and I appreciate you dialing in. Let me start with QBO for a minute, core U.S. I think one of the things that we are working hard to help everybody understand inside the company and outside is last year, when we introduced QuickBooks self employed, we actually eliminated the low end SKU in QuickBooks Online, which was called QuickBooks Online Simple Start. And so we always use account QuickBooks Online Simple Start as the core QuickBooks Online product lineup because there is a low end customer who quite frankly was over-served by that product. And we shut it down and replaced it with QuickBooks self employed. So I think it\u2019s a little bit of a misnomer to say, pullout self-employed and to tell us how the rest of QuickBooks Online is growing. But that would be similar to saying pullout TurboTax Deluxe and just look at the rest of the product lineup. I think it is something we all have to get our head around is it is a part of our core product lineup and honestly, it\u2019s expanding TAM. There is 30 million to 50 million people in that space that the original QuickBooks Self-Employed or Simple Start didn\u2019t serve. So I think that will be the first thing and I just want to make sure that you know that\u2019s how we look at it. Now, when you back that out and say how is the QuickBooks Online for U.S. business growing what I would like about it is its doing exactly what we wanted it to do. It\u2019s expanding TAM. So the desktop customers are still growing. QBO, 80% of the customers are new to the franchise. They have never used QuickBooks or Accounting before. Self-Employed is going after a category that they could have never been served before with the old QuickBooks Online Simple Start and you put it all together and in the U.S. that number is, without Self-Employed, growing in the mid-30s, which is a very healthy number. But if you add back in Self-Employed since we used to have Simple Start in there, the number is even better. So that would be the way we look at it in terms of core. And I do think there is continued opportunity to keep that healthy above 30% and even potentially accelerate it as we get wiser about how to market the Self-Employed product. So that\u2019s on the Self-Employed side. On the accountant side, you are actually right. This business is strategic. We have known for years, two realities about to the accountants being involved in a Small Business choice. The first is the success rate of the Small Business goes up 89% if they work with an accountant. The second is over half of all accounting, payroll and payment decisions are made because the accountants influence them and told them to buy it. So they are a tremendous decision-making advocate for our products. The third piece is the piece that we talked about today in the opening points. Yes, the accountant is working with the Small Business. The retention of QuickBooks Online goes up 1,100 basis points, 11 points and a point of retention is incredible for us in our subs business. So, the importance of the accountant has never been more critical as we moved to FAS and we also think they are going to be catalyst to get a lot of these customers to adopt the cloud which is why we are leaning in so heavily with QuickBooks Online for accountants. So, that\u2019s one of the summary of the accountant side and I hope I also helped clear up a little bit about how we look at core QBO especially as it relates to Simple Start or Self-Employed, I am sorry, I got the old term in there, Matt. Latif? Operator : Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Brad, I have one multipart for you on TurboTax and then one for Neil. On TurboTax, you had mentioned on an earlier question, after you turned out Absolute Zero, you still grew very nicely on a relative basis. Could you please elaborate on this year versus past years? And then just as the follow-on, could you elaborate on the ACA in the fraud dynamic this year and how you are looking forward to next year? Thanks. And then I will come back later with Neil\u2019s. Brad Smith : Yes, Scott. Thanks for the question. In terms of elaborating on TurboTax, as you know, the full season and we picked up a little over 3 points a share. As you look at it in pieces and parts sort of early season, what happened in the core season, why Absolute Zero was an offering and then what happened at the end of season when Absolute Zero stocks being offered by us, although one of our competitors continue to offer a version of it out there and we went back to full price. We took equal parts share throughout the season. So, we didn\u2019t have any variation that said, hey, this will hold the result of this. And then you step back and say, well, what drove that? Well, when you look at it this year, the team put out 3x, three times more the product innovation than we did last year over 20 new product feature functionality and innovations where I put into the product. And that was a really good campaign that I think resonated, where people really felt more self-empowered was what actually drove our competitor advantage this year. And so, that\u2019s really the TurboTax piece. In terms of ACA and price, we have been pretty consistent on ACA. It\u2019s just the next piece of legislation that\u2019s been introduced by government. The cause of people to say, this is complicated and our job is to say no, you are capable of doing it, we will make it simple. And we worked really hard for 3 years to do that and the Affordable Care Act has not been a headwind at all. In fact, it\u2019s been one of the highest converting aspects of our website. In terms of fraud, we will have a summit again in the summertime with the rest of the industry and the IRS Commissioner. But I think we all collectively feel good that we made big advances this year as an industry and we think that those advances will continue as we look ahead to next year and we remain committed to getting bad actors out of the U.S. tax system. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks so much for that, Brad. And then, Neil, you alluded in prepared remarks that 430 still looks like the most reasonable shakeout points for fiscal \u201817 EPS. At Investor Day, you discussed some things that would drive you towards the low and the high end of the range. Could you just somewhat address that and tell us how you are seeing each of those items progressing now that we have moved a couple of quarters since the Investor Day? Thanks so much. Neil Williams : Sure, Scott. I think the thing that this season has confirmed for us is that when we have an opportunity to increase our share and grow our customer accounts it\u2019s a great way to grow our top line revenue and also our earnings per share, so just like we talked about back in August. I think as we see opportunities to grow the top line more through customer acquisition, it tends to move us up and we tend to see move on the top side. We are looking to invest and make the product better every day both in Small Business and in Consumer Tax. As you can imagine this time of year, we have a lot of ideas, lot of suggestions for ways to take advantage of that expanded addressable market as Brad mentioned and to grow the product faster. We are running test and we are running experiments now to determine, which of those we think would have the biggest impact next year both in Small Business and in Consumer Tax. We consider the markets that we are in. We have talked about some adjustments we have made in some of our markets outside the U.S. already. So, those are things that help us balance, Scott, between delivering what we consider is a very strong mid-teens improvement in EPS at the same time, while continuing to invest in the future to be sure that we have a good 18 to 19 after 2017. So, that\u2019s kind of the way we are looking to bounce it off for the balance of this year and see more about that when we give guidance in August in the Investor Day. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks so much. Brad Smith : Alright. Thank you, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff of Credit Suisse. Your question please. Mike Nemeroff, your line is open. Michael Nemeroff : I am sorry, can you hear me now? Brad Smith : Yes. Michael Nemeroff : Thanks for taking my questions. You gave a lot of detail specifically around the blended retention rate. I was curious if you could maybe break out the retention rates or give us a sense of the retention rates, the differences between the different subscribers and QBO, the U.S, the international and specifically the SE since its growing so fast. And then on the delta in the contribution between a QBO sub and the desktop customer, I am curious how many years do you anticipate before there is parity between those two customers in the future? Brad Smith : Okay, Michael. I will take the first one and have Neil jump in and help on the second one. We are pretty guilty of sharing lots of facts and factoids and our fact sheet is pretty rich. One of the things we haven\u2019t shared at this point is breaking out the retention rates for different SKUs in QuickBooks Online. We don\u2019t tend to do that for the other product lines either, so, QuickBooks Online Self-Employed versus its bigger bothers and sisters in U.S. and non-U.S. I can tell you what we did talk about, which is we began the year in the low to mid 70s and we are finishing up the fiscal year with retention in the high 70s. That\u2019s pretty significant improvement in a 12-month period and we see opportunity to continue to improve that as we go into next year. But unfortunately, we aren\u2019t breaking out at the level that you would like to hear it today and over time, if we think that becomes more meaningful and material, then we will consider doing that. And Neil, the second question was QBO subs and desktop? Neil Williams : Yes. On the average revenue per user, Michael, there is a pretty big gap right now. We talked about around $425 a year for the U.S. subscriber versus something around $125 a year for a subscriber outside the U.S. And what we said was we clearly expect to see that revenue per user growth for each one of those segments. And as Brad mentioned in the script, that\u2019s certainly our experience so far this year, but we don\u2019t see that gap actually closing and we don\u2019t see a QBO subscriber outside the U.S. getting to the same average revenue per user we see in the U.S. for a considerable time period. We don\u2019t really have the payroll and payments attach opportunities that you see in the U.S. outside the U.S. And that\u2019s where a lot of the revenue comes from as you well know. And so we think that disparity is going to exist for a while. Are you speaking of online primarily or are you thinking of desktop? Michael Nemeroff : Both actually, but that answers the question. Thank you very much. Neil Williams : Okay, thank you. Brad Smith : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Yun Kim of Brean Capital. Your line is open. Yun Kim : Hey, Brad. On the QBO payroll and payment attach rates, can you just talk about what efforts are being made to improve the attach rates for existing QBOs rather than focusing only on the new QBOs. So, if you take out the QBO Self-Employed, are the overall attach rates for QBO subs improving? Brad Smith : Yes. So, let me just start with the second part of the question first. If you back out the Self-Employed and the non-U.S. QBO subs, I am looking at Matt and Jerry, I know we had done some math on that and I believe the answer is they are a little bit year-over-year. So, thank you for that. We got so many different pieces of math here. The second piece was then what are we doing in addition to new. And the good news is with someone is coming in and making an accounting decision the best time to get them signed up for payroll and payments is in that first 90-day window, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t go back and continue to drive penetration into the base. And at FAS product you are able to do that, you are able to do that with special offers, you are able to do that moment of truth sort of pop-ups and things that will say, hey, you decided another employee, which is like to sign up for payroll services. And just as we are learning in TurboTax, we can use machine learning and data science to look for more creative ways to expose them to these kinds of offers. And so I have to tell you, TurboTax has been leading the way and using data as a way to attach products and services. And we are now bringing that same level of rigor to the QuickBooks Online team and we are trying to use that as a way to improve the attach rates for payroll and payments as well. We are early days, but we think there is a lot of opportunity there and we feel the same way many of you and this call have, which is it looks like a lot of upside there or you are going after aggressively and our answer is yes, we are and we agree. We have a lot of opportunities to continue to improve. Yun Kim : Okay. And then just on that QuickBooks Desktop unit sales has been pretty resilient over the past several quarters, I think last quarter, you talked about some pricing was driving some of that resiliency, when can we expect that unit sales to kind of go back to like double digit decline versus right now it\u2019s been pretty strong? Brad Smith : So far Kim, I have been wrong on every desktop forecast we have made, because one of the things that we assumed was that that customer behavior was predictable based upon what we saw in other product lines, like TurboTax and desktop and it\u2019s not. What we are seeing right now is there is a very delighted group of QuickBooks Desktop customers. And when we try creative things like raising the price on them lowering the price on the cloud, getting feature parity, that didn\u2019t move them while it did cause them to delay purchasing the newest version of QuickBooks Desktop. So then, we went back and we tested some pricing promotions, it\u2019s not an everyday low price. We did advertise at the price that it used to be before we raised it and sure enough those customers went out and bought the newer version of QuickBooks Desktop. So the good news is they are staying with us. They are not going anywhere and they are not hurting QuickBooks Online subscribers. So really, what we are doing now is we are making sure that we keep those customers happy. We continue to expose them to attach services like payroll and payments and we continue to let them know that there is a file based version that\u2019s great for them, should they ever decide to move. But our hope right now is that we keep them in the franchise regardless of which product they choose. Yun Kim : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Brad Smith : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nandan Amladi of Deutsche Bank, your question please. Nandan Amladi : Thank you. I am at the airport as well, so pardon the background noise. So I was going to ask about the BDO partnership that you announced yesterday, can you put that in the context of the ProAdvisor networks you have and what segments and geographies this video partnership was intended to do and what your expectations are for revenue contribution? Brad Smith : Great Nandan. Thank you for the question. As we talked a few minutes ago, accountants are critical. We have had the program for years called ProAdvisor. In the last couple of years, as we leaned into the cloud, we put a cloud-based set of services together for them, but it includes QuickBooks Online for accountants and a lot of other value added services. I have mentioned the fact that we have 600,000 of our customers now that are linked to an accountant and that\u2019s up 70% from last year. And this announcement that we announced yesterday at BDO was just another example of we are working with accounting firms of all sizes. Not just the independent firms, also the ones that buy our ProSeries and Lacerte product to do taxes and also larger firms like BDO. At this point in time, we are working together to come up with a set of goals that we think are realistic in the first year as we get their firm strained and get them prepared to be good consultants for QuickBooks Online. So we haven\u2019t announced any public goals. I can tell you, we are very excited about the partnership, the world class firm, it\u2019s very relevant to the customers that we serve and we think it will be value added for their firms as well. Nandan Amladi : Thank you. Brad Smith : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thanks for taking my question. Brad, you talked about promotional pricing rolling off for QBO, can you help us think about fiscal \u201817 and fiscal \u201818 pricing both for QBO and TurboTax, what should we expect on a year-over-year basis, sort of apples-to-apples unit price? Brad Smith : Yes. David, we want to be vary as sharing any of our pricing decisions too far in advance, because obviously we have competition that would love to know the answers to these questions. But that being said, we have a tailwind and our tailwind is as you know, we offer a promotional discount in the first 30 days or sometimes the first 90 days for someone to come into QuickBooks Online. They will begin to use it for free, then they will get a discount of like 30% then they work their way at the full price. And imagine the large base of net adds we have been putting in that will anniversary off of that as a 13th month and then will basically become full price at a roughly $24, $25 a month. And we have a nice tailwind of that base, it\u2019s going to be rolling off that promotional pricing. So what you should expect in \u201817 and going into \u201818 is continuing improvement in average revenue per customer. Now this is where Neil answered a few minutes ago comes into play. We have got three cohorts of customers. We have QuickBooks Online U.S, QuickBooks Online non-U.S. and of course the mix effect of QuickBooks Self-Employed. All of those are actually getting stronger every 90 days in terms of average revenue per customer. But depending upon which one of those grows the fastest you can actually bring the blended mix down a bit. But we would tell you. We look at it on a marginal contribution basis for each of those cohorts and all of them were getting better and will continue to get better in \u201817 and \u201818. David Togut : Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful. Just a quick follow-up, you had mentioned that you had essentially equivalent functionality at this point between QB Desktop and QBO, is the functionality for manufacturing customers, which I think is about a third of the QB Desktop base, particularly advanced job cost and advanced inventory management, you have equivalent functionality for those customers now on QBO versus QB Desktop? Brad Smith : Yes. David thanks for the question. And I didn\u2019t mean to suggest we had 100% feature parity, because we don\u2019t. We are still in that 70% plus range. We just made some decisions last week to continue to invest in building out feature parity to get it at the premiere and eventually the QuickBooks Enterprise level that will be a multi-year journey. But I will put in the context for you, no, we don\u2019t have those advanced inventory capability today. We have foundational inventory, which is different than it was 6 months ago and it\u2019s getting stronger everyday, but it\u2019s not advanced yet. We don\u2019t have the job costing in there yet. But I think it\u2019s important for us to kind of think about of the 3.5 million desktop customers we have today, 2.5 million do have feature parity. 2.5 million could move over tomorrow if that was the only decision they were waiting on. And as we know, we have moved about 100,000 over to the first three quarters of this year, that\u2019s up 22% last year, but that\u2019s not 2.5 million. So, we are going to continue to build up feature parity. We think that\u2019s important for the long-term. We are going to continue try to get the accountant to encourage the desktop customer to look at the cloud and we will continue to do things like promotional pricing. But I think at the end of the day, we just got to get that Small Business comfortable that it\u2019s good to be in the cloud and I think that\u2019s just going to be a matter of time. David Togut : Understood. Thanks so much for the helpful detail. Brad Smith : Alright, buddy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Colville of Arete Research. Your question please. Patrick Colville : Hi, there. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Can I ask you about the profitability in the Small Business segments really nice uptick there that was notable? And some color on whether that was assumed by the desktop business or whether there is some moving parts in online that are worth highlighting to us? Neil Williams : Patrick, this is Neil. I think that the big thing you are seeing there is the impact of the ratable accounting change we made last year that has some impact on this year as well. The overall business unit contributions in the segment, if you take that into account, have been in the low 40s, high 30s and that\u2019s where we are out to be and where we expect it to be. I am sorry? Patrick Colville : And then, I mean, looking forward to next year, the way that I am modeling out to get you full $1.30 EPS estimates, I think you guys will need a quite aggressive continuation in profitability in the Small Business segment. Is that right? And if so, what are the levers that I can expect you guys to pull on to achieve that? Neil Williams : Well, I mean think about, Patrick a couple of things. On the plus side, we definitely continue to see improvements in average revenue per user and growth in customers. This is also the side though where we have opportunities to grow and expand to invest in the markets where we are already entering the space. But whereas Brad said, we are not the number one player. And we may consider additional markets next year. So, this is a great area, where we have big opportunities to drop revenue and increase revenue in the short run, but also big investment opportunities that don\u2019t pay off in the short run either. So, we are balancing those two things in our planning process for a multiyear profit plan to be able to generate good cash and good profitability in the short run, but make sure that we are investing for the long haul too. So, that growth is sustainable and accelerating beyond 2017. Patrick Colville : Go ahead, go ahead. Thank you so much and well done on a brilliant three months. Brad Smith : Thank you, Patrick. Take care. Operator : Thank you. And gentlemen, I am not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith : Yes, I would, Latif. I want to thank everybody for the questions today. As we are entering the final stretch of our fiscal year, we feel like we are building some really strong momentum. Our strategy is working. The innovation we are putting under our products is not easily replicated and matched by our competitors. And we are still on the early innings of penetrating this large and growing total addressable market. So, we are excited and we are looking forward to talking to you again soon. And until then, everyone, have a good day. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

My name is Latif and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2016 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call over to Matt Rhodes, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Rhodes? Matt Rhodes : Thank you, sir. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2016 conference call. I am here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO and Neil Williams, our CFO. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2015 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. Also, all reported results and guidance, except GAAP, net income and EPS, exclude DemandForce, QuickBase and Quicken, which have been sold and reclassified to discontinued operations. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And finally, I am excited to let you all know that I will soon be moving to Texas to lead finance for our ProConnect business. Therefore, today will be my last earnings call in the Investor Relations seat. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with you all over the past 6 years and I will leave you in good hands. Jerry Natoli will continue to head up Investor Relations following my transition in early September. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brad Smith. Brad Smith : Alright. Thank you, Matt, and thanks for an amazing 6 years in the Investor Relations seat. I\u2019ve got to tell you we are super excited to see the impact you are going to have in our ProConnect business going forward. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. I will tell you we had an excellent finish to the fiscal year. For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $754 million, which was up 8%. We have continued to build on our momentum throughout the year with fiscal 2016 revenue coming in at $4.7 billion, up 12%. Let me begin by sharing a few reflections on our business performance and I will start with Small Business. With the shift to the cloud and mobile solutions, the opening of our platform to enable third-parties to connect, and our expansion into new geographies outside the U.S., we have more than doubled our total addressable market. Our primary goal is to penetrate this large addressable market, growing our customer base and expanding share in every geography. Our Small Business ecosystem remains vibrant with total QuickBooks Online subscribers growing 41% this year to more than 1.5 million subs. We added more than 400,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers over the past 12 months. We are leaning in to new offerings, like QuickBooks Self-Employed, while continuing to post strong growth in QuickBooks Online overall. We finished the year with about 85,000 self-employed subscribers, which is up from 25,000 just one year ago. Outside the U.S, QuickBooks Online grew 45% to 287,000 paying subs. In short, QuickBooks Online continues on a strong trajectory and we are executing well against the consistent set of priorities. We are realizing our goal to be the operating system behind Small Business success, helping small businesses save time and money so they can thrive when times are good and they can remain resilient when times are tough. We are also delivering outstanding results against our other strategic goals to do the nation\u2019s taxes. For the fiscal year, Consumer Tax revenue grew 10% with TurboTax Online units growing 15% and total TurboTax units growing 12%. We performed extremely well this past year, introducing two dozen innovations in TurboTax, which helped expand the do-it-yourself software category while increasing our share in the category as well. We fully anticipate another competitive tax season next year and our teams are already hard at work building on the next wave of innovations at a pace that promises to exceed this year. On the ProConnect side, revenue came in as expected at $428 million. Our ProConnect team is continuing to increase the focus on multi-service accountants. Those are accountants who do both books and taxes for their clients. This is in service to driving those accounting firm\u2019s success, as well as growing our own Small Business ecosystem. To sum it up, fiscal 2016 was a strong year from start to finish. The QuickBooks Online ecosystem is driving Small Business growth and our tax businesses are celebrating a successful season. We are heading into fiscal 2017 with the wind at our backs, and we have some exciting plans underway as we look ahead. So with that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details. Neil Williams : Thanks, Brad and good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $754 million, up 8%; non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; a GAAP operating loss of $56 million; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.08 and a GAAP loss per share of $0.16. For the full year, we delivered revenue of $4.7 billion, up 12%; non-GAAP operating income of $1.6 billion, up 36%; GAAP operating income of $1.2 billion, up 68%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.78, up 46%; and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.69, up from $1.28 a year ago. As a reminder, our GAAP results for fiscal 2015 and 2016 reflect the decision to divest certain businesses in fiscal 2015 and the sale of those businesses in fiscal 2016. You can refer to our press release for more details. Turning to the business segments, total Small Business segment revenue grew 10% for the quarter and 9% for the year. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth finished the year strong at 41%, as we crossed the high end of our guidance to finish with 1,513,000 paid subs. Small Business online ecosystem revenue grew 25% for the full year and we expect some acceleration in fiscal 2017. Within the online ecosystem, our payroll and payments businesses posted healthy growth for the year. Online payroll customers grew 17%, online active payment customers grew 6% and online payments charge volume grew 15%. And while QuickBooks Online is driving the majority of our new customer acquisition, QuickBooks Desktop remains a resilient and important part of the business. Desktop units grew 14% in the quarter and 8% for the year as we saw a bump up in customer upgrades. Roughly two-thirds of the desktop units we sold in fiscal 2016 were upgrades as opposed to new units. New desktop customers were essentially flat year-over-year. Total Small Business desktop ecosystem revenue grew 4% for the year. For fiscal 2017, we expect units to decline modestly, and desktop ecosystem revenue to be flat to up slightly. Moving over to tax, Consumer Tax revenue grew 10% for the year. As Brad said, we will continue to invest in the product experience and to prioritize growth in customers above margin expansion. ProConnect revenue grew 51% for the year due to changes in our offerings that resulted in lower ratable revenue recognition in fiscal 2015. As I mentioned on the earnings call in May, we expect ProConnect revenue to be roughly flat in fiscal 2017. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15%. With approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. When it\u2019s the best use of cash, we will return cash to our shareholders via share repurchases. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased $2.3 billion worth of shares at an average price of $91. We reduced our weighted average share count by 7% net in fiscal 2016, and we expect to be in the market consistently in fiscal 2017. We have a total of $2.4 billion on our repurchase authorization, including $2 billion recently approved by our Board. Our plans include a cash dividend of up to $1.36 per share for fiscal 2017 with the first quarter dividend of $0.34 per share payable on October 18. This represents a 13% increase versus last year and reflects our confidence in our business strategy, as well as more recurring and predictable revenue streams. You can find guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. Here are the highlights for fiscal 2017; QuickBooks Online subscribers up 2 million to 2.2 million, growth of 32% to 45%, Revenue of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, growth of 7% to 9%, Non-GAAP operating income of $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion, growth of 8% to 11%, GAAP operating income of $1.33 billion to $1.38 billion, growth of 7% to 11%, Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.40 or growth of 14% to 16%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.45 versus $3.69 in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2016 earnings per share includes $0.65 net income per share from discontinued operations. We feel confident in our ability to deliver against our financial principles and our long-term strategic goals and we look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout this fiscal year. On a personal note, we will miss Matt\u2019s outstanding contribution in Investor Relations. We are very fortunate to be adding his experience and business acumen to our ProConnect Group as we strengthen the connection between our accounting community and our small business ecosystem. And with that, I will turn it back to Brad. Brad Smith : Alright. Thank you, Neil. To recap, we are pleased with our fiscal 2016 results and I am encouraged by our trajectory. Our trajectory in small business as we continue to grow QuickBooks Online in the U.S. and in our prioritized markets around the globe, at the same time, we are expanding the category by solving new customer problems with QuickBooks Self-Employed. Our tax businesses had another strong year, turning at the innovation machine to compete effectively in the marketplace. We look forward to building on this success in fiscal 2017. We will talk more about these priorities and our strategy to execute against them at our Investor Day, which we are going to be holding on our Mountain View campus on September 21. We look forward to seeing all of you there. And with that, let\u2019s open up to you to hear what\u2019s on your mind. So Latif, I will give it back to you. Operator : Thank you, Sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Brent Thill of UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. Congrats Matt, on the new role. Brad and Neil, on the operating margin side, you had a really solid year of operating margin improvement, up over 700 basis points year-over-year, the guidance implies a much slower rate of operating margin improvement, can you talk a little bit about why that is, where you are spending? Neil Williams : Sure Brent, happy too. You have to factor in the effect of ratable on the improvement increase in \u201816 over \u201815. But I will tell you the thing I feel good about in our \u201817 outlook is the amount of money that we are putting into the product itself to improve the product experience in the markets where we are focused. Really nice go-to-market plans and programs there to capitalize on the TAM opportunity we see before us. And I think we have given ourselves some good opportunities on the revenue side by not focusing on price increase to drive revenue growth. The revenue growth that you are going to see in 2017 is largely driven by customer growth and customer accounts, and as you saw this year in Consumer Tax in 2016, we think they are just big opportunities to grow our customer base and continue to expand. So, I think the margin expansion you are going to see in 2017 is going to be very well balanced between investments to drive growth and product improvements and also a very reasonable approach on the pricing side. Brad Smith : Yes. And Brent, this is Brad. Just to add to Neil\u2019s thoughtful answer around where the investments are going, the other thing that we feel good about is when we moved the ratable in 2015, we provided a long-term guidance that we would return margins back to the mid-30s in 2017. And so with all those investments that Neil is talking about, we are going to be coming in where we said we would several years ago. So we feel very good we have a very strong business model that continues to get operating margin expansion. But at the same time, we continue to invest for the long-term growth. Brent Thill : Thank you. Brad Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. I am wondering if you could Brad, maybe update us on the composition of the sub adds you expect to see in 2017, it feels like your international subs are slowing, maybe more than I would have expected in your U.S. just sort of regular way subs are actually doing quite well. And maybe you can contrast kind of where you were a year ago when you look to that 2 million to 2.2 million and where you think the contribution is as you get to it next year? Brad Smith : Hey Walter, this is Brad. I will jump in on that and if Neil wants to add something, feel free to do that, Neil. Today, on our net adds, about two-thirds are coming from QuickBooks Online in the U.S, another third is coming from outside the U.S. of QBO and of course QuickBooks Self-Employed. We do feel the same way you do, that we believe that have more opportunity ahead of us in QuickBooks Online outside the U.S. I am constructively dissatisfied as is the team with our current growth rate, but that\u2019s not without a lack of very solid plans that give me increased confidence as we look ahead. We have an increased focus on product market fit. We have really good lessons learned from this year in terms of go-to-market plans on a country-by-country basis. We have been adding incredible talent. You probably saw the announcement of Lucas Watson joining us after 17 years of global experience at Procter & Gamble and 5 years over at Google, and we just feel good about the outlook. So as we look ahead, we still feel good with our 2 million to 2.2 million. We think there is more opportunity in the levers in both outside the U.S. with global, as well as with QBSE. And we are going to leaning into to that, and we will talk to you more about it when we see at Investor Day, but that\u2019s sort of the headline. Walter Pritchard : And Brad, can you maybe update us on any changes you are seeing in terms of attach, any trends there that are notable particularly on the QBO side with payroll payments? Brad Smith : Yes, we can. One of the things we would say is, for us, attach is an input metric. The most important metric at the end the day is the penetration into the base, which leads to an average revenue per customer. So on the attach rate this past quarter for new users, payroll is at 19%. Now keep in mind that has an increasing base of QuickBooks Self-Employed. And so as you add more self-employed customers who by definition don\u2019t have employees, you are going to have an attach rate that looks like it\u2019s going in the wrong direction. But that\u2019s actually healthy when you actually normalize it. And our payments attach was at 11%. So right now, we feel good with those leading indicators. We think there is room to improve and we have a focused effort to do that particularly with the first time use experience. But they are all moving in the direction we want and we expect to have improved attach rate as we go into next year. Walter Pritchard : Great, thanks. And Matt good luck, tough shoes to fill there to keep the management team there shielded from our nagging. So that\u2019s been good working with you. Matt Rhodes : Thanks Walter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hey, I will echo my congrats Matt, one of the best in the business. Look forward to hearing more about your success in the business. Couple of questions for Brad and Neil, one is, can you talk a little bit more about what Lucas Watson\u2019s particular emphasis of the company is going to be, what specifically about him attracted you, what do you think he could achieve for you guys definitely in the next 3 years to 4 years, and then I have a follow-up question with respect to payments? Thank you so much. Brad Smith : Yes, Kash, happy to do that. So for us, we were looking to replace someone who is almost irreplaceable. Caroline Donahue, who has been our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer and she is a 21-year veteran of Intuit. And she reached a chapter in her life where she wanted to step away, both girls are now in college. We love her. We celebrate her and we have taken a 1-year victory lap, because she let us know some time ago she was going to do that. And we began a very concerted search to look for someone who had digital experience, someone who had clear mobile experience, and someone who had world class marketing skills. And sometimes, you will find classical marketers from packaged goods who may not have as much digital experience. So you will find those who grew up in the digital world, but they don\u2019t really understand the platform marketing aspects, and we think we found a Rainer in Lucas. As I mentioned, 17 years at Procter & Gamble through a range of different product lines, leading them across the globe. He ultimately took P&G online and led their digital efforts. And then from there, he was recruited away by Google and he helped monetize YouTube and more recently, has been leading their innovative global solutions around the world. And so, we are excited to have him as he brings both that classical marketing as well as digital experience. And what he will be doing is be leading our sales channels. He will be leading the company\u2019s marketing efforts and the global country managers report directly into him. So, he will have the non-U.S. locations and that\u2019s where his expertise will come to bear and he will work very closely with our general managers in the U.S. to try to help our global expansion. Kash Rangan : Got it. My follow-up and final question, Brad, what was the attach rate for online payroll, online payment this quarter and what are your longer-term objectives in that regard? Thank you very much. Look forward to seeing you at the Analyst Day. Brad Smith : Same, yes. I am sorry, we were just looking because the attach rates for online payroll and payments. I mentioned these just a couple seconds ago and the payroll numbers are 19%, but that includes a base of QuickBooks Self-Employed in there. And then the second is on payments, it\u2019s at 11%. So, those were the attach rates. I just want to make sure I heard the question correctly, Kash. Kash Rangan : Correct. And also your objectives, Brad, for where would you like that to be in fiscal \u201817, \u201818 timeframe? Brad Smith : Yes. I talked about this in terms of the total addressable market. We know that about half of small businesses today, except credit cards and so we think there is a nice penetration upside opportunity in payments. In payroll today, you look at the audience of customers who have employees and we think we have got the opportunity to drive that number up north of 30%. In terms of what we will achieve the next 12 to 24 months, we want to continue to see sustained improvement. And so we don\u2019t have a target that we published externally that said at the end of 12 months, we want to be here. But I can assure you that internally, we have goals and objectives to improve that number and get them closer to the numbers I just talked about. Kash Rangan : Fantastic. Thank you very much. Brad Smith : Alright, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jesse Hulsing of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Jesse Hulsing : Yes, guys. Thanks for taking my question. The total number of QuickBooks paying customers, including desktop really inflected this year, growing, it looks like by my calculation something like 23%. And if you exclude international self-employed, it was up I think 18%, which in the U.S. would be pretty strong growth. I am wondering what you think is driving that. Is it the economy? Is it share gains? Is it something else? And do you view this type of double-digit growth for total QuickBooks paying customers is sustainable moving forward? Brad Smith : Yes, thank you, Jesse. We feel good about that. So, for those who are looking at the fact sheet, the total paying customers were up 23%. We saw healthy growth across the board. We saw QuickBooks Online subs at 41%. We saw the desktop customers growing 8%. If you look at those that are new to the franchise in QBO, it was north of 80%. It was 84% this quarter. And so there is just healthy growth across the board. And what\u2019s driving it is we are expanding the TAM. We are expanding the TAM in three ways. With the shift to cloud and mobile, more people are now considering accounting software than they would have in the past. They could come in and try it for free and then sign up for it if it\u2019s actually improving their effectiveness. The second thing that\u2019s helping us is we are getting the opportunity to connect our products with other products like PayPal and American Express and so it gives us more consideration. And last but not least is global expansion, which has opened up tens of millions of more prospects to our products that we couldn\u2019t have served a couple of years ago. So, that\u2019s one big bucket. It\u2019s just expanding the TAM. The second is we did see a strong repurchase cycle in desktop this year. So, the desktop units rebounded and it was primarily because with all people who were coming at the end of their 3-year cycle and they upgraded and they were able to buy the newest version of QuickBooks desktop. And that gave us a little bit of bump here in the last pass of this fiscal year. But by and large, we do think this is sustainable. We have opened up the total addressable market. We think that cloud and mobile is going to help us. And we think there will be a group of customers that will still want to be on desktop and we plan to have a great desktop product as well. Jesse Hulsing : Thanks. And a quick follow-up on margins, your segment margin for Small Business was up about 500 basis points this year. I am wondering when you look to your implied margin guidance for FY \u201817, how much of that is driven by Small Business continuing to expand its margins? And I guess longer term where do you think you can get Small Business margins, too? Thank you. Neil Williams : Yes, Jesse, this is Neil. And the lion\u2019s share of that improvement really is driven by the shift in ratable. And I will tell you as we go forward as we reduce our hosting cost and see other changes made in our processing infrastructure, that\u2019s going to be an opportunity for margins to expand a little bit in the Small Business space, but this is also where we are investing heavily in R&D and in go to market. This is a key area where we do not focus on margin percentages in the Small Business group. We are doing everything we can to encourage customer growth in this area and deeper penetration into those addressable markets you just heard Brad mentioned. So, we are intentionally not encouraging the team to expand the margins necessarily in Small Business, but to really focus on the top line growth. And so I think what you are seeing now is really more driven by some changes we have made in our hosting infrastructure and more predominantly the shift we made from ratable last year. Jesse Hulsing : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks a lot and my congrats to Matt as well for the move to the business unit. You will be missed. Brad, one for you just on international QuickBooks, can you just remind us which country just came online this year? And is there anything we can talk about in terms of incremental countries as we look forward into fiscal \u201817? Thanks. Brad Smith : Thanks, Ross. So, really the country that came online this year was France. We entered the first half of fiscal year in beta and they went to general release and it\u2019s now up and running. And we have got a Z1 of the product out there and we are feeling good with the early trajectory. I would also say that Brazil, even though it came on at the end of last year, really start to hit its stride this year. That was through an acquisition of a company called ZeroPaper and then we introduced QuickBooks Online in Brazil. All the other countries, we have been out there for several years now. And in terms of new markets, we currently have a rest of world strategy where we are testing product market fit and we are looking at the download of customers looking for the product and using it. But we have not announced any new countries or any plans to expand at this point. We want to wait and see that we truly have a proven product market fit before we put people in the market and begin to develop it. So right now, I would just say we are focused on these half dozen countries we are in and we have opportunity with Brazil and France to get them up to critical mass. Ross MacMillan : Great. And just a quick follow-up, obviously, this year benefited from some of the ratable revenue shift and a very strong tax season and that\u2019s part of the reason why the growth revenue guidance for fiscal \u201817 is lower. But I am just curious, the 7% to 9% range versus your double-digit sort of ambition, do you have any thoughts on when we might get back to double-digit growth on the top line assuming that\u2019s still part of the strategic intent? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes, Ross. Well, we absolutely see that as part of our strategic intent. We share our financial principles that we believe are enduring and we believe that we have a portfolio that can sustain double-digit organic growth over the long-term. You also hear us talk a lot about the first priority is expand our categories and to grow our customer bases. And if you look at the focus on customer growth this year, you saw TurboTax Online growing 15%, you saw QBO growing 41% and even QuickBooks Desktop growing at 8%. We know if we get that flywheel going, our ability to monetize those customers and to make \u2013 accelerate our revenue growth over time is the proven formula. So right now, our guidance is 7% to 9% given where we are, but our full intent is to continue to look for double-digit growth on a sustained basis. And I don\u2019t know, Neil, if you want to add anything to that? Neil Williams : No, I think that\u2019s perfect, Brad. And I think, Ross, when we see opportunities to grow customers faster than we might expect otherwise, we are going to go for that heavily. And I think the payoff comes when you expect to see that double-digit growth is when we begin to monetize those customers in later years. So, we see a big opportunity in front of us in \u201817. And we have intentionally really focused on the best ways to get those customers in. Ross MacMillan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good afternoon. Congratulations, Matt. Brad, I was curious on the \u2013 you mentioned disappointment in international QuickBooks. Could you give us an update report on Canada and India, please and just elaborate on the statement and some of the things you have planned going forward? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes, let me start with the disappointment first. We are pretty candid. We will stand up in front of you and share the things we feel good about and the areas we think we can improve. And when we stand up in front of you at Investor Day, I will show you the same thing I showed the board in July is when we have a base of 287,000 paying subs and we are growing at 45% and then you have a base of 1.5 million, when you include the U.S. and it\u2019s growing at 41%, a 400 basis point disparity in growth rate I don\u2019t believe is sufficient for the size of the base. We know we are capable of more. We have good products and we know we have the opportunity to get out there and accelerate this total addressable market and penetrating that market. So, that\u2019s just the candid reality. We talk about it that way inside the company. But that said I got to tell you we have some real momentum being built up in the UK, early start in France and Brazil and strong momentum in Australia. Canada has rebounded. So, as we told you, our one issue we had in Canada as we had tried to sell QuickBooks Online in a box in a retail store. It was an experiment we had tried in the U.S. it didn\u2019t work and we shut it down, but we let it go in Canada a little while longer. We saw the same sort of attrition issues. And so we pulled it out and we created to grow over a problem. That\u2019s now in our rearview mirror. So Canada is moving in the right direction. India is the one that we are trying to develop a model that shifts away from the accountants and focuses directly on small business and then looks for ways to monetize that over the long-term. And we are running a series of experiments in India, but this is a very small part the base. But that\u2019s the one that I would tell you that we still have several alternatives we are exploring, but we don\u2019t have the go-to-market model figured out in India yet. And so that\u2019s how I feel about overall global. I don\u2019t want to paint a black picture over this. I think there are some really shining areas. But when you put it all together, 287,000 paid subs growing at 45%, I know we are capable of more and our aspirations are to accelerate that performance. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks for that. And then Neil, could you elaborate on acquisition pipeline and strategy there, some dividend increase you have been active in repurchase \u2013 share repurchase, so just thinking going forward about capital allocation, China has been a bunch of small tuck-in by talent acquisition, how should we think going forward just on the strategy? Thank you. Neil Williams : Yes. Scott, I think we are going to continue to look for opportunities to build on our product roadmap, to add feature functionality and add new technology really across of the board. Some of it internal that we use some things like privacy and security and infrastructure management. Some delivering feature functionalities like we have talked about in the past. But we have proven adding teams and adding technology really accelerates our product development cycle. And so we are keen to do that. You will probably \u2013 you will continue to hear about activities in that space. They are typically relatively small. And so it\u2019s not a big commitment on our overall capital planning. But our \u2013 as you saw, our CapEx guidance for 2017 is back to more normalized levels. The cash flow generation of the company is very strong. And so we are comfortable that we have got plenty of room to do the acquisitions we need, to fund this increase in the dividend of 13% and continue to be active in share repurchase as well. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yun Kim of Brean Capital. Your question please. Yun Kim : Thank you. So Brad can you just talk about the cost of subscriber acquisition costs for QBO subs and how that have been trending and just try to better understand the overall the cost structure around the overall QBO sub adds and is there a big difference in acquisition costs between the regular QBO subs versus self-employed versus international subs? Brad Smith : Yes. So let me take this, Yun and then Neil and I can tag team. I will start first with LTV to CAC, which is lifetime value cost to acquire a customer. We all know is the metric for a fast business. And in the U.S, our LTV to CAC is north of 5.5%. So it\u2019s a very healthy number with an opportunity to continue to improve as we become more efficient. Outside the U.S, as we are building the market and we are building up our brand, our LTV to CAC is not at that level, but it continues to improve with every cohort of customers we bring on. And so we have an overall rigor that is focused on LTV to CAC as we try to expand its new geographies and try to accelerate our customer base growth. In terms of QBSE, I do not believe that we have reported or talked about LTV to CAC. So I am turning to you Neil\u2026 Neil Williams : Right. Brad Smith : Okay. So that\u2019s sort of the amount of material or the information we share at this point. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question or not. Yun Kim : It helps a little bit. But it kind of leads me to the next question, which is you guys maintained the QBO sub-target for the year at 2 million to 2.2 million, which is fairly wide, is it fair to say that you guys are keeping your options open regarding your spend or is there some other dynamics in there that\u2019s kind of keeping you the range that wide for the year? Brad Smith : Yes. Thank you, Yun for the question. Let me step back and talk about that for a minute, because we have a philosophy that we will update our guidance when we have a change in our outlook. And right now, there is no change in our outlook. We have been trying to message for some time that our goal is to keep our subscriber growth north of 40% and our QBO ecosystem revenue growth between 25% and 30%. And this quarter, once again showed that we were in those ZIP codes. And so we didn\u2019t feel the need to go out and change the guidance which we have provided a year ago in the fall. But I do want to remind that when we first set guidance for QBO subs a year ago at Investor Day, the number has been 2 million in 2017. And last fall, we said we are going to move it from 2 million \u2013 2 million to 2.2 million. If you kind of took our current trajectory and you do the 40% growth rate approaches squarely in middle of that guidance range. And we will talk to you at Investor Day about levers we are looking at around global \u2013 excuse me, global growth, QBSE and other things that can move us up in that guidance range. But since there is nothing meaningfully different, we did not want to change the guidance and signal anything that quite frankly, hasn\u2019t changed. Neil Williams : I would just add Brad, if I could just add on. The cost and the acquisition cost is really not the constraint between the low and the high end of the range. We do measure very rigorously our acquisition costs by channel and by market. And where we have opportunities to bring in customers that are going to be profitable over the long-term, we have plenty of resources and we are more than willing to invest in those. And when we pull back investments because we had concerns about the quality of the sub long-term or about their ability to stick with us over a long period of time we really monetize at the rate we expected. But we are more than ready to invest when we see a channel, a product opportunity or a market that\u2019s really going gangbusters. So the investment level or the resource allocations are not a governing factor on the resource range at all. It really is a factor of the opportunity size with how effective we are being with our product customization and localization for the market and our go-to-market campaigns. Brad Smith : Good add. Thank you, Neil. Yun Kim : Okay, great guys. Thank you so much. And just wanted to say good luck to Matt and thanks for all the help over the years. Matt Rhodes : Sure. Thanks Yun. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hi, good evening Brad and Neil. A question on the tax side Brad, you talked about you expected competitive tax season and I am wondering, do you think that will only be in the online or would you anticipate any changes on the assisted side as well for the upcoming season? Brad Smith : Yes. Good evening Kartik, every year as you know, it gets highly competitive in the tax arena. And I would anticipate another season like that. I think that we have great competition. They have very proactive plans to continue to try to grow their customer bases and I think that would occur both online as well as in their stores. I know that\u2019s a hotly contested market as well. So I would anticipate a competitive tax season from great competitors across the board. Kartik Mehta : And then as you look at your guidance for FY \u201817 on the tax side, what would you anticipate in terms of mix and price, I am assuming you would anticipate greater volume than price, but I am just interested how you break that 6% to 8% down? Brad Smith : Well, Kartik as you know, we have a pretty consistent rule of thumb, which is to expand the category and grow our share and grow our customers faster than we grow our revenue. And so really nothing has changed there. We are in the fourth year near \u2013 fourth year now of a multi-year journey to basically get taxes done with little to no effort at all. And we have been putting a lot of innovation into the product. Last year, there were two dozen innovations we introduced in TurboTax. The typical year was six. That platform is in place. And we anticipate as many or even more innovative new ideas going into the product this coming season. So it\u2019s really going to be about the product doing a better job and it\u2019s growing our customer base. We are not going to rely on price increases and we are just going to rely on continuing to expand the category and grow share. Kartik Mehta : And then just one last question Neil, as you look at the upcoming year, you have talked about investment and obviously growing QBO clients and tax clients, I am wondering at what point would you say you would want to increase the investment, what would you have to see to say, we should increase the investment because in the long run that will be beneficial for Intuit? Neil Williams : Well, as you can imagine Kartik, we have assumptions internally about the growth we expect in terms of customers that equate to the revenue that we are guiding and the expenses that we are setting aside. If we see those customer growth rates expand faster than we expected, we see investments playing off, then we have opportunities to reallocate within the company and put dollars to where they are getting the best return and the best outlook. I think we have a pretty rigorous process though of reallocating internally to things that are working really well and dialing back things that are not generating what we expected when we built the plan together. So we have an internal process I think works pretty well. We look at the customer growth and how we are doing with the revenue per customer quite frequently. LTV to CAC, Brad has already mentioned. And so we have opportunities to adjust and reallocate money that we are going to spend internally pretty frequently throughout the year. And we do that, as a matter of fact. Kartik Mehta : Alright. And Matt, I will look forward to talking to you offline about your decision. Matt Rhodes : Sounds good. Thanks Kartik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your question please. Sterling Auty : Thanks. Hi guys, congratulations Matt. Brad, you mentioned that there was a bit of a refresh cycle in terms of the desktop side, I am kind of curious, what do you think at this point is the major gating factor that prevented a bigger portion of those desktop users to moving to online? Brad Smith : Yes. Sterling, I would say first of all, there really isn\u2019t a major gating factor other than their willingness to adopt the cloud. In fact the number of migrations who moved from desktop to QuickBooks Online this year within our own customer base was up 25%. So we have done work with our customer base in the desktop to figure out why they aren\u2019t interested in the cloud. And reasons one through five are all basically, I am not ready to move to the cloud. I don\u2019t want to put my data in the cloud. I don\u2019t want to move to a subscription service. My current product is working just fine. My accountant is working with me and they have got a desktop version. Those are the kinds of reasons. In fact, only 14% cite feature parity. So we want to make sure we keep these customers in the franchise. We want to continue to get their accountant comfortable with using the cloud version. And we want to continue to let them know that we can help them migrate to the cloud when they are ready. As long as they stay with Intuit, we are happy. But right now, that\u2019s sort of bucket one which is, there really aren\u2019t any major barriers other than their mindset and comfort level with the cloud. The second side is the repurchase cycle. We see this happen. And last year, we had raised the price on desktop. We did it for the first half of the year thinking that might actually drive people to the cloud. What we now realize is it wasn\u2019t a price issue, it was the mindset. And so when we brought it back down to more normalized promotions, we started to see the regular repurchase cycle happen again and that\u2019s what carried into this year. And so I think what we see as a group of people who probably delayed an upgrade last year. And then this year, they came back in on their normal rhythm. Sterling Auty : That makes sense. And then just one follow-up on the tax side, given we are in an election year, is there anything that you are seeing out of either parties that you think would have a material impact to the positive or the negative on your tax franchise? Brad Smith : Sterling at this point, we just want to remain focused on working with whoever ends up winning the election. We are big supporters of tax simplification. That\u2019s the business we are in. We are big supporters of voluntary compliance, which is helping people voluntarily file their taxes. And if the government disagrees, let the government contest that. And at the end of the day, we want to make sure we are helping people keep their hard earned dollars in their pocket, only pay the stuff that they owe the government. And so whether it\u2019s a Republican, a Democrat, an independent, we have a lot of years of working with both sides to try to make sure that we keep those three things front and center. Sterling Auty : Thanks. Brad Smith : Alright. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Your line is open. Jim MacDonald : Good afternoon guys. You talked about accelerating small business growth rates, I assume that has to do with better monetization, but maybe you could talk a little bit more about how you \u2013 how that\u2019s going to work? Brad Smith : Sure. Jim I think first of all, it has to do with both customers and monetization. On the customer side, while we continue to see strong growth in QBO in the U.S., we believe we have upside opportunity with better execution, stronger product, market fit and just a continued learning curve outside the U.S. And also we are in the early days of QuickBooks Self-Employed, 85,000 paying subs now versus 25,000 12 months ago. And we really learned a lot this year as we put the bundle together with TurboTax and we went after people like the Uber drivers and the Lyft drivers. So we think there is a lot of opportunity to continue to grow the customer base. Then when you get to monetization, there is an opportunity there and we can see the tailwind at our back or we can feel the tailwind at our back rather. One is, we see opportunity to continue to improve attach. The second is, as those customers move off of promotional pricing and they hit their 13th month, the average revenue per customer goes up about 50%. And the third is we did just pass through a modest price increase in QuickBooks Online. It\u2019s gone out to the new customers. And we are in the process of rolling it out to existing base. And those three things combined help us drive the average revenue per customer, which ultimately drives up the QBO revenue. So it\u2019s those two things that we see continuing to drive improved performance in QBO. Jim MacDonald : Great. And over on ProConnect, could you remind me why you are expecting a decline next year and kind of what you expect maybe longer term for ProConnect? Brad Smith : Yes, I can. I will start first with the strategic role ProConnect plays in the business. The accountants are not only the key to small businesses making their accounting, payroll and payments decisions, so they have a very important role to help us work with small businesses and help them be successful. But obviously, they also have a business that they monetize, where they do tax returns for consumers and small businesses. And we are laser focused on the multi-service firm. Those are the people who do both books and taxes, not only for consumers, but also for small businesses. And that\u2019s a very large population. So, one of the things that we have chosen to do is we step back and said, let\u2019s look at how we lined up our product and pricing to better serve those customers. And some of it requires us building better collaboration between QuickBooks and their tax products and so we are in the process of building that R&D out. And some of it is we needed to stop pricing for every single piece that we were giving the accountant. So, for example, this year we have chosen to give QuickBooks Online for accountant \u2013 to the accountants for free. We don\u2019t charge them. Another thing we chose to do this year is not to take a price increase at the normal levels we would on the tax product. And instead, we are starting to build that into the accounting product. So, we have stopped taking price everywhere we historically did. And as a result of that, we are kind of backing off on the revenue growth short-term on the ProTax side of the house, but we think long-term that\u2019s going to accelerate the overall revenue growth for the company. Jim MacDonald : Great. Thanks. Brad Smith : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nandan Amladi of Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Nandan Amladi : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, you touched on a little bit of this, Brad, but I was wondering as you look at the ProAdvisor network as it stands with your desktop ecosystem and as you think about building that out on the QuickBooks Online side, what are some of the puts and takes or the major differences that you see? Brad Smith : Building out the ProAdvisor network on the \u2013 I missed the second part of the question. Nandan Amladi : On the QuickBooks Online side, is it an additional \u2013 what\u2019s your approach? I guess are you trying to convert your accountants over? Are you not growing it, because lot of the growth in the QuickBooks Online franchise is actually coming from self-employed and international, where perhaps the \u2013 and the target group is a little bit different even in the accounting community? So, I would just like to contrast the differences between the traditional desktop ecosystem versus the online accountant ecosystem. Brad Smith : I got it. Thank you so much. I appreciate the clarification. Well, first of all, one of the pieces of good news is, anyone who is in the desktop ProAdvisor network is also now in the cloud network. So, we gave them a cloud package. We trained them. We certified them. And they are increasingly recommending their customers to use QuickBooks Online. In fact, the last numbers I saw, we were north of 600,000 accountants who had at least one customer on QBO. And then those who actually have three plus customers have more than doubled in the last 12 months. And we see those as great leading indicators of not only cloud adoption on the accountant side, but them recommending it to their clients. So, that\u2019s one thing, which is the desktop ProAdvisors have come along with us. The second is our ProAdvisor program is a global program. So, we are enrolling accountants in all the countries. And as I think you alluded to in your question, in some countries, the accountant\u2019s recommendation carries even more weight than it does in the U.S. There are some countries where, for example, France, the accountant is the end-all and be-all in terms of making the final decision on whether this product is ready for small business client to use. So, we have partnered very closely with those accounting professionals to make sure that they feel good, they are certified and they are endorsing our product. So, by and large, what you see is on a case-by-case basis, this cloud-based product is available to desktop. It\u2019s available in all the countries. We have a similar approach where we work with those local accounting professionals to make sure it meets their needs, so they in turn will endorse it with their clients. Nandan Amladi : And is QuickBooks Online made available for free across the globe to advisers? Brad Smith : It is. Yes, QuickBooks Online for accountants is available for free to accountants across the globe. Nandan Amladi : Thank you. That\u2019s all for me. Brad Smith : You are welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your question please. Rayna Kumar : Good afternoon. This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. I noticed that QBO pricing \u2013 revenue per subscriber increased for the quarter roughly 1%. And this is the first time I have seen that after nine consecutive quarters of decline. I guess, what were the drivers of that increase? Brad Smith : Want to take that one, Neil? Neil Williams : Sure. I think Brad has mentioned to you and just talked about as customers are maturing in the QBO online ecosystem, they are coming off promotional pricing and our attach has improved a little bit. So, it\u2019s a small increase. And honestly, we would prefer to see the customers growing really faster. So, this is kind of an unintended consequence, Rayna, to be honest with you. I think the healthier statistic longer term is to see the customer growth accelerate, but that\u2019s the main driver between the improvement you see in the fourth quarter is just more of those customers coming off. We had a couple of big quarters a year ago, which meant that in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter, you had little bit more customers than usual coming off that promotional period and paying the full price. That\u2019s just an indication that retention rates are holding up quite nicely as those customers do come off that promotional pricing. Once they have used the product for longer than a few months, they are pretty sticky. Rayna Kumar : Thank you. Operator : Gentlemen, I am not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith : Yes. Thank you, Latif. First of all, I want to thank everybody for their acknowledgment of Matt. It\u2019s nice. He is sitting here and he has been blushing through the call. But we feel the same way you do. He is incredible. The good news is, Jerry Natoli is sitting right here next to him and he is ready to step in and take the game to the next level. We also want to just echo, we feel good about our results in fiscal year \u201816. We also really see momentum as we head into fiscal year \u201817. And we are looking forward to continuing to build this franchise over the long-term. But more importantly, we are excited to share with you those plans and those ideas when we see you on the Mountain View campus on September 21 at Investor Day. So until then, we look forward to speaking with you soon. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

My name is Lateef and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's first quarter 2017 conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Intuit's Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Mr. Natoli? Jerry Natoli : Thanks Lateef. Good afternoon and welcome to into its first quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. I am here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO and Neil Williams, our CFO. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I will turn the call over to Brad. Brad Smith : All right. Thank you, Jerry. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us. Fiscal 2017 is off to a strong start and we are building on the momentum that we developed in fiscal 2016. In the first quarter, we grew revenue 9%, exceeded our QuickBooks Online subscriber guidance and we beat our overall financial target. With that backdrop, let me begin by sharing a few reflections on our business performance and I will start with small business. QuickBooks Online continued to gain traction as we pursue a large global market opportunity. Our goal remains to be the operating system behind small business success. Helping small businesses save time and improve their cash flow so that they thrive when times are good and they remain resilient when times are tough. Total QBO subscribers grew 41% in the quarter to more than 1.6 million subs. We drove acceleration in our small business market outside the U.S. where QuickBooks Online grew 50% to 323,000 subscribers, up from 45% in fiscal 2016. The increase came in Canada, the U.K. and Australia with subscriber growth in the U.K. accelerating to 87% which was up from 78%. We continue to focus our efforts on improving the product market fit in the remaining countries which includes India, Brazil and France and we will report more on our progress with these efforts in the coming quarters. QuickBooks Self-Employed is also contributing to the acceleration of subscribers. Roughly 110,000 of our QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed. This is compared to 85,000 last quarter and 35,000 year ago. We have now launched QuickBooks Self-Employed in the U.K. and in Australia as well. I am encouraged by the starts in our small business group but I also expect our momentum to continue accelerating in the second half as we draw towards our QBO subscriber target of 2 million to 2.2 million subs for the full fiscal year. I am confident in this acceleration because of the innovations that we have coming to market, including improvements in the core QBO platform that simplify the first use experience, including enabling small businesses to generate their first profit and loss statement in less than five minutes. We have also introduced a new smart invoicing capability that allows for real-time tracking of the invoice status in both QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Self-Employed. We have also enhanced the QuickBooks Self-Employed user experience with the ability to now receive payments on mobile devices and always on mileage tracking. And finally, our recently introduced partnership with Google enabled a seamless integration between QuickBooks Online and Google Calendar. Based on the strong product market fit that we have in Canada, the U.K. and Australia, we are leaning into greater go-to-market activities behind QBO in these countries. It's these factors that support our confidence in the continued acceleration of QBO subscribers in the back half of the fiscal year. With that overview on small business, let's talk tax. We are gearing up for another exciting tax season in TurboTax by continuing our multi-year investments in product innovation. Those product innovations are focused on re-imagining the tax preparation process while driving customer growth and increasing market share. We also continue to promote a set of best practice and the standards within the industry that enable the IRS and the state to improve the ability to combat tax fraud. In ProConnect we are focused on serving multiservice accountants who do both books and taxes for their customers. Our goal is to be the operating system behind these accountant's success as well. In service to this goal, we are providing one location within QuickBooks Online for accountant where the accountant can access all of their workflows. Several exciting innovations are underway to begin to leverage the capabilities that we developed in TurboTax within our accountants offering, including increasing the number of documents that can be automatically uploaded which reduces data entry. We expect these innovations to help us further strengthen our accountant relationships by helping drive QuickBooks growth over time. So across the board, we are off to a strong start in all our businesses. And with that, let me turn it over to Neil who will walk you through the financials. Neil Williams : Thanks Brad and good afternoon everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $778 million, up 9%, GAAP operating loss of $61 million, non-GAAP operating income of $32 million, a GAAP loss per share of $0.12 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.06. Note that our GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of the early adoption of the new accounting standard update for share based compensation. This update requires excess tax benefits realized upon the settlement of a share based compensation award that flows through the earnings statement instead of the balance sheet. We expect this accounting change to reduce our GAAP tax rate from approximately 34% to approximately 32% for full fiscal 2017. The impact on GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.07 in the first quarter and $0.12 for the full year. Turning to the business segments. Total small business revenue grew 11% for the quarter. As Brad mentioned, QuickBooks Online subscriber growth remained strong and we exceeded our guidance for the quarter reaching 1,638,000 subs, up 41% year-over-year. Small business online ecosystem revenue grew 26% for the quarter. As we discussed at Investor Day, we are focused on driving customer growth first followed by online ecosystem revenue. We expect online ecosystem revenue to grow 25% to 30% this year, accelerating as the year progresses. QuickBooks Desktop remains a resilient and important part of our business. The first quarter was exceptionally strong for desktop units, up 23% as unusually high renewals from existing desktop customers were driven by operating system upgrades. Our plan does not assume this growth continuous throughout the year. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 6% in the quarter. Moving to tax. Consumer tax revenue for Q1 was $60 million and ProConnect revenue was $112 million. This was in line with our expectations in a seasonally light quarter. To help with your modeling, we expect second quarter consumer tax revenue to grow about a point faster than last year, given the way the calendar falls in January 2017. And as a reminder, we expect to provide a tax unit update in late February concurrent with our second quarter earnings release. We will also provide a final unit update in late April after the tax season ends. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15% over five years. We ended the quarter with approximately $600 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet. Our first priority for the use of that cash is investing for customer growth. One of the best use of cash, we will return cash to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. We repurchased 1.8 million shares in the first quarter for $192 million and $2.2 billion remains on our authorization. The Board also approved a dividend of $0.34 per share payable January 18, 2017. You can find our fiscal 2017 Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. We reaffirmed our full year guidance with the one exception being higher GAAP earnings per share guidance due to the early adoption of the accounting standards update mentioned earlier. And with that, I will turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith : All right. Thank you Neil. I have to say I am pleased with the strong start to the fiscal year and I remain optimistic about the path we are on to grow our QuickBooks Online franchise here in the U.S. as well as in our prioritized markets around the globe. We are building on our QBO momentum in Canada, the U.K. and Australia and we further expanded the category with relevant offerings like QuickBooks Self-Employed. Our third annual QuickBooks Connect conference in late October was a great success with attendance up year-over-year which reinforce the power of the ecosystem that is creating these dispensable connections between small businesses, accountants and developers. So on a headline, we like how we have come out of the gates in Q1 and we remain focused on delivering another great year. So with that, Lateef, let's open it up and hear what's on everyone's mind. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill of UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Good afternoon. Brad, on the small business segment, the operating margin was flat year-over-year. You obviously grew it in 2015 to 2016 pretty nice margin improvement. I know you don't give a lot of guidance specifically to that business, but there's been some concern as you go international that you can\u2019t maintain that operating margin expansion. Can you just walk through how you think about the segment business first for small business on margins for the rest of the year? Brad Smith : Yes. Brent, sure can. First of all, as we look at the company overall, you know, our financial principles are to grow the topline double digits, to grow revenue faster than expense, which gives us operating margin expansion and that produces strong cash flow and then we invest that cash flow to grow the franchise, either through internal investments, it's acquisitions or it's returning cash to shareholders. And ultimately, as we look at the businesses, both tax businesses, we like to see those business margins north of 60% and in small business given we are in an expansion mode, investing in growing category, expanding into new geographies, we like to have that in the neighborhood of 40%. I wouldn't get too caught up in the first quarter. We had some things that we have moved around last year. We had our QuickBooks Connect conference that fell in the second quarter last year. This year it fell in the first quarter. So that brought a little bit of the marketing spend forward. So right now we actually feel good about the overall investments that we are making and in our ability to deliver the kinds of margins that we typically talk you to about. Brent Thill : Thank you. Brad Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. I am wondering if, Brad, you could help us understand on the international side. I have to say, a little bit of a turnaround or an improvement in your tone there relative to even the Analyst Day you had back in September. It sounds like some of those countries you are seeing stronger trends there and I am just wondering, obviously you talked about product market fit. But any more detail you could give us about why you think that's ticked up a bit in some of those countries? Brad Smith : Yes. Walter, sure can. You are right. At Investor Day, we were pretty candid and [inaudible] about seeing the opportunity outside the U.S. being much larger with the potential to grow faster than we were able to produce in fiscal year 2016. Our teams are already on that. I am simply the radio man and the good news is that we are working on closing out that last mile of getting the product compliant and at the levels that these countries expect. We got there for Canada, the U.K. and Australia and as a result of that, net promoter scores are going up, so we have leaned in the go-to-market activities in those countries. The team also has and we have seen by the way the corresponding increase in growth from 45% up to 50% and I called out the U.K. specifically which exited last year at 78%, now it's at 87% and this continues to build momentum. These other remaining countries have their own timeline to get that last mile completed for product market fit and they are very near term. We expect to see those coming online as well. So I am optimistic that we are on it. We know what the right levers are and the first quarter shows that if we focus on it we can actually get the numbers moving in the direction we want. So you should hear some more optimism in my tone now because I am starting to see the proof points pay off. Walter Pritchard : Okay. And then just relative to desktop, I heard the comment on the operating system upgrades driving some of that. How much of that would you say was people who maybe re-committing more than you expected to the desktop? And obviously the online subscribers overall this quarter were quite strong, but as we look out a couple quarters, how does potentially more of your customers re-committing to desktop impact what you might be looking for in terms of online subs as we get out a year or more as maybe some of those were to move over? Brad Smith : Yes. Walter, we actually feel like we are expanding the category by having both offerings in the market. So, primarily the desktop business was the result of the operating system upgrade. Windows 10 drove an upgrade cycle and then the operating system upgrades, then Mac. And it was about 60/40 Windows and Mac. If you pull those out, it was basically flat to down 1% without the upgraders. And so I would say that kind of normalizes things out for us. If you look at the total customer base and you counted the way we used to, which we no longer put out on the fact sheet, those are people using at least the last three years version of desktop or they are buying a subscription, the total base grew in the neighborhood of 5% and that's up from where it was when we exited last year. And then if you break that down, you mention QBO subs are strong 41%, the desktop got a boost through this upgrade cycle, which pushed it up to 23% and you put it all together and the total paying customers in this last period was up a total of 33%. So I do not see cannibalization happening. I do think we were the beneficiary of these operating system upgrades. We are going to continue to have a good quality desktop offering but we are leaning into the cloud and the customers are choosing the cloud. So I would say that net net, we are growing the category. Walter Pritchard : Great. Thank you Brad Smith : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jesse Hulsing of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Jesse Hulsing : Yes. Thanks for taking my question guys. I wanted to drill in to your expectations for payroll and payments moving forward a little bit more. The payroll subscribers accelerated. I am curious what your thought is on whether that acceleration is sustainable? And I am wondering on the payment side when you will start to see the impact of the invoicing product starts to hit the model? Thank you. Brad Smith : We do see opportunity to continue to strengthen our performance in payroll and payments and the team is focused on that, just like we are with our international expansion in QBO. I feel good that the team knows the right levers and we are continuing to optimize and improve. Currently right now, if you look at the penetration rates into the customer base, payroll is at 15% in QBO and that compares to roughly 32% in desktops. So we have got a lot of headroom there. And payments right now is in the neighborhood of 6% in penetration and that's a little ahead of desktop and we think that opportunity just has more headroom as well. So our outlook is that we are going to continue to focus on this and we are going to continue to have you focus on the penetration numbers because that's the ultimate size, but the payoff for us is we have been guiding subscriber growth of QBO greater than 40% and we saw that tick to 41% and we have been guiding QBO ecosystem revenue of between 25% and 30% and we saw it tick up to 26% in this quarter and that's the proof of the opportunity we have if we just stay focused on those two numbers. We are going to see strong payroll and payments growth and strong overall SBG growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh : Hi. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. I wanted to toggle back to some of the dynamics behind subscriber guidance or the subscriber performance this quarter. So if I recall last year, I think you had some challenges in India and there was sort of a reset in terms of strategy there. I think in Canada also there was a change in go-to-market. So I guess my question is, is how much of this quarter's performance in terms of the year-over-year growth is coming off of the easier comps? And then going into the second half, is it just a function of better feature functionality driving that international growth going forward? Is that the right way to think about it? Brad Smith : Okay. Great question. You are correct. Last year, as we had a period where we didn't feel like our non-U.S. growth was reflecting the kind of opportunities we see ahead of us. We did have two countries that were in a pivot, Canada and India. Canada was actually because we had tried to test to selling a QBO subscription in a retail box in retail stores. And what we found was, we were getting units, but then they were attriting, they were dropping off after a 90-day period and so we literally didn't like the quality of the sub and we pulled that out and we had a grow-over. Canada has since been picking up momentum and growing, but the real upside here was not just Canada, in the U.K. where we went from a 78% growth rate in Q4 to an 87% in Q1 shows that it's picking up momentum as is Australia. So I would tell you, this is less about a year over year easy comp and this is more about that product market fit and leaning in the go-to-market and that's the kind of feedback we are hearing from customers. And of course we have the other three countries that we are getting to the last stage of product market fit as well and then we will start to lean into those in the back half and that's why we feel like our 2 million to 2.2 million target is absolutely the right target to be given. Sanjit Singh : Understood. Thank you for that. And just a quick follow-up and an update on maybe some of the unit economic metrics. So if there is any comments you have on renewal rates in terms of QBO and maybe by segment? And then also with respect to ASPs, I noticed on the Analyst Day that the ASPs for QuickBooks Self-Employed were up pretty nicely versus fiscal year 2015. So could you give us any sense of how ASPs by QBO segment looks like this quarter? Are those trending up? Brad Smith : Do you want to take this one, Neil? Neil Williams : Sure can. I would give this a shot. It's Neil. If you go back to the guidance we gave in the conversation we had at Analyst Day, there are a number of moving parts in this. Clearly, QuickBooks Self-Employed, as Brad mentioned, is growing quite nicely and which is overall providing some downward pressure on our overall ASPs. We did implement a price change in QBO in the U.S. midway through the first quarter this year, which had a little bit of a impact. It will impact for the balance of the year. It's a very modest price increase, but it's on a fairly large base. And as we have already talked about, we are probably focused more on retention and driving the value of the accounting product outside the U.S. where you know, we don't have the same potential for payroll and payments with that as we do in the U.S. but first quarter was good. It actually looks like we are very much on track with our expectations. You saw the acceleration in the online ecosystem revenue by a point. So early in year but so far I think the plans we made are playing out exactly as we expected. Sanjit Singh : Any early indication on renewal rates in Q1? Neil Williams : Nothing. No substantial change from what you saw at the end of last year. Sanjit Singh : Perfect. Thank you so much. Brad Smith : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please. Ross MacMillan : Thanks for taking my question. Brad, a couple. Maybe the first one is just on online payroll adds. I think the online payroll adds were 40,000. That's up lot relative to the run rate you have been doing. What actually happened there? Was there some international payroll markets that opened up? Or is there any other high level driver for that this quarter? Brad Smith : Yes. So first of all, one of the things we are continuing to do is improve the online payroll first use experience. So one of the areas that the team has leaned into is make it easy for you to come in and then contextually find additional services like payroll and payment. We did have a reclassification which may give you a little bit of a pop in the fact sheet of about 7,000 units that have been attributed to the -- it's in the Mac product. It had been attributed to desktop. It's now being attributed to online. That's where it should have been classified along the way. So it's giving you a little bit of an additional bump. But underneath that is really strong growth with the tens of thousands, you talked about roughly 40,000, the bulk of those are just continuing to improve the user experience and then there was a 7,000 subscriber pop as a result of a re-class. Ross MacMillan : Okay. That's helpful. But no other, it wasn't like you opened up an international market to payroll for the first time. There was nothing like that. Neil Williams : No. Brad Smith : No. There wasn't. Ross MacMillan : Okay. That's helpful. And then just I am curious now that you have opened up Self-Employed, I think you said to U.K. and Australia. Any sense for, when I look at the overall international adds, any sense for how material the Self-Employed addition was within the international adds? Brad Smith : Well, I put it in total aggregate and if you look at it in aggregate, we added 20,000 Self-Employed subs in the first quarter and that compares to 60,000 in the full 12 months of last year. We weren't in the market for the full first quarter in the U.K. and Australia. That's been in more recent weeks. But the early results have been very positive. And so I would say, overall most of that acceleration continue to be in the U.S., but we are getting some upside with the new country expansion. Ross MacMillan : Okay. That's helpful. And great to hear the active base growing up 5%. That's a very good number. So congrats from me. Brad Smith : Thank you Ross. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good afternoon. Guys, I am going to switch it up and go over to tax. Brad, I am curious, with the PATH Act coming up in this upcoming tax season, just curious how you think that's going to shape early season filing behavior? And it looks like the storefront guys are going to have some new refund advance products. Just your thoughts on how you might compete with that? Thanks. Brad Smith : Sure Scott. Every year is an exciting year in tax. Our team is geared up. We have got some really cool product innovations and go-to-market campaigns and the team's itching for the season to start for that first whistle to blow. Obviously we do have the PATH Act this year. Those are people who have earned income tax credit or for those who actually have a child credit, the IRS is working with the rest of the industry has decided to hold those refunds until February 15 which helps us increase W-2 verification and prevent fraud. We have been very supportive of that. We believe fundamentally though that IRS and the industry is still leaning in towards nine out of 10 returns, who will actually get the refund back in 21 days. So we don't see a material change in the seasonality, but we are fully prepared to help those people get their money. In terms of some of the stores leaning in with these refund anticipation loans, we pulled out of that business, as you know, more than a decade ago. And you can go back and track our results while they have had refund anticipation loans and we have not. We have been able to manage to grow the do-it-yourself category and to gain market share over that period of time. So we fundamentally don't see a shift in any sort of method behavior based upon history and we are fully prepared to help those people with earned income tax credit get their refunds. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks Brad. And just on a follow-up, what are you expecting for industry growth this year in tax with the IRS? And just your thoughts on potential influence this year or looking out a few years, given the results of the election? Thanks. Brad Smith : All right. Well, our assumptions right now are in the neighborhood of 1% to 2%. We typically are in the zero to 1% range. Right now, everyone in our business as well as some in the industry suggest that it might be a little more robust this year. So we will have to say somewhere in that zip code of 1% to 2%. In terms of what's happened with the election, you know as well as we do, we have been in this business now for over three decades and we hear a lot of really good intent and then ultimately what happens when the new President and Congress get in is what we actually turn that into. And so I would tell you that we remain dedicated and supportive of things like tax simplification. We have been big supporters of that. I am very vocal about it. We are very supportive and vocal about voluntary compliance and we are also big fans of putting more money in the pockets of small businesses and consumers paying less tax. So, so far that's sort of what we are hearing, but we haven't got to January yet. We don't have the new President elect in office and the new Congress. So right now we are just prepared to do what we always do is have the best product in the market and try to win the customer one customer at a time. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks. Brad Smith : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nemeroff of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Nemeroff : Thanks for taking my questions. Brad, do you have maybe any early data points regarding the subscriber contributions from some of the new ecosystem partners, namely G Suite and AmEx? And what your expectations for subscriber contributions towards that 2 million to 2.2 million subs in the year? And then for Neil on tax, now that you are selling the SE product bundle with tax, I am curious how you are going to recognize tax revenue coming from SE? Is it going to be on a subscription? And if so, do you expect any impact in Q3 from that SE product with tax? Brad Smith : Okay. Michael, I will take the first one and give Neil the second one, as you had asked. In terms of an individual partners subscriber contribution, we haven't provided any of those breakdowns, but I can bring it up to an overall impact. We know where one of our small business customers attach as a third-party product. That increases the retention of QBO 10 points. And so we are big fans of these partnerships that we are announcing because we think it improves not only the customer experience because they can solve additional problems but also it helps build more retention into QBO which is one of the biggest levers we have in terms of recurring revenue. So that's sort of how we would look at it at an aggregate level. You want to talk about the bundle? Neil Williams : Sure. We are excited about the TurboTax online and QuickBooks Self-Employed bundle and we will see how that plays out. The way we are going to treat that, Michael, is that we are watching carefully to see how those customers engage with QuickBooks Self-Employed after tax season is over. And so for those customers who are active and who use the QuickBooks product, we will defer and allocate part of that revenue over the 12 month subscription period that they are entitled to use QuickBooks SE. We have some assumptions around what those utilization rates are that are baked into our guidance for the year, both for units and for revenue. Certainly, if we see that play out differently and we see the guidance change, either by quarter or for the full year, we will let you know. But for those customers who do activate and use the self-employed component of the bundle after tax season is over, we will be allocating a portion of what they paid over the 12-month period that the subscription covers. But that's reflected in the guidance for the full year and we come back and give you guidance for Q3 and Q4, we will have those assumptions baked in. Michael Nemeroff : Okay. Thanks very much guys. Brad Smith : All right. Thanks Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Yun Kim from Brean Capital. Your question, please. Yun Kim : Thank you. Congrats on a solid QBO sub number. But I guess I will ask on the overall strong QBO Self-Employed performance, is that your core U.S. QBO subs, when you exclude the self-employed version actually grew strong in the quarter for the first time in a while especially off the somewhat of a slowdown last year. I know it's just one quarter but do you expect that part of the core traditional QBO subs to rebound this year? Does the traditional QBO sub adds, is that heavily influenced by what you are doing currently with focusing on the accountant programs and whatnot? Brad Smith : Yes. Thanks Yun Kim. First of all, I really appreciate that you called out the U.S. QBO subs number. We are also very pleased with those results and we think there is more in the barrel for us to get there. In fact we talked about these innovations that will really kick in for the second half. I was talking about that first use experience, the ability for a first-time user to come in and get to their P&L less than five minutes, we think will be really cool for final conversion. The other thing is, if invoicing tracking capability, think about that like an ability to have Uber or FedEx tracking for your invoice where you literally can go in on your phone, you send the invoice that will let you know if it's been opened, then it will let you know if it's been paid and then it will send you an alert when it's actually in your account. And that's getting small businesses paid 15 days faster, over two weeks faster. And then we have other components we are adding as well as like Google Calendar. The ability for someone to have their appointment in Google Calendar and then click on it and send an invoice and have a flow right into QuickBooks and get paid, those are all elements that not only help QBO outside the U.S. but it will help accelerate our growth rate in the U.S. So we think there is fundamental strength in the United States while also looking at these non-U.S. markets and we think these innovations will only add some fuel to that fire. Yun Kim : Okay. Great. Thank you. Brad Smith : Thank you Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your question, please. Kartik Mehta : Okay. Thank you. Brad, I wanted to ask you a little bit about tax and the success you have had with Absolute Zero. As you see more competition in the marketplace, whether it's this RAL funding or your competitors kind of going to an Absolute Zero, do you think you have to expand that program to even include more forms to attract customers? or do you think where you are and the strategy you are taking doesn't have to change? Brad Smith : Kartik, thank you for the question. We have been on a multi-year journey to re-imagine the tax preparation process and our goal is to eliminate six billion hours of tax prep drudgeries. You don't even have to answer questions. And last year we knocked off 40% of the time it takes to file an average tax return in TurboTax and we leaned into a leading mobile offering that no one else has. And I think that is the source of our advantage and our market share gains. Just to give you a case in point, last year we had a competitor who matched Absolute Zero, not only matched it in terms of the product line but they even kept it out in the market longer than we did. We ended the program March 31. They you carried through the end of tax season. And we still took share. So my fundamental belief is that price is not a durable competitive advantage, neither are promotions. It is the product and the experience you create for the customer and we have got a three or four year head start on the players in the market by basically re-imagining this next chapter. The second piece on RAL, as I mentioned a few minutes ago. We pulled out of that business more than a decade ago and you can go back and look and I know you have, you and I have spent time talking about this. You can look at do-it-yourself category growth. You can also look at our market share gains within that category despite not having a refund anticipation loans. So we don't believe we are dealing with anything differently this year in terms of a RAL than we have for the last 10 to 12 years and we are fundamentally leaning into the product experience and we think it's going to be another competitive season, but I like what our team has in the pipe and looking forward to the January 1 kick off. Kartik Mehta : And then Brad, I just want to go back to what you were saying about the PATH Act and make sure I understood, were you saying that even with the PATH Act, you anticipate that most refunds will be around the same time that customers got it last year? Or was the point that the timing of the difference, whenever the IRS starts processing, it will be the same? Brad Smith : Well, the overall, if you put all 150 million returns that the IRS will process roughly in the year, nine out of 10 of those will actually get a refund back in 21 days or less. The PATH Act does actually know when on those who do earned income tax credit and those who have a child credit and they are going to have that refund held back until February 15. So for those who come in early, have those qualifications and are hoping to get the refund sooner, they are going to be held back for a week or two here until February 15. So that will be an impact to Group. But our goal is to help those individuals understand the status of their refund, keep them apprised and make sure they have a great experience. But fundamentally, I don't think they are going to shape or shift the overall tax season. And that's our philosophy going in and we just want to make sure we are there for these customers. And I don't think the refund anticipation loan, honestly, is going to shape the overall season. I think it's basically going to be a period of time and then we are going to get past that. Kartik Mehta : Thanks Brad. I appreciate it. Brad Smith : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your question, please. Sterling Auty : Yes. Excuse me. Thanks. Hi guys. You talked about the strength in the QBO subs internationally, but I am just kind of curious what your thoughts were around the additions here in the U.S. in the quarter relative to your expectation? Brad Smith : Yes. Sterling, as I shared a few minutes ago, when Yun Kim asked about the United States QBO subs, we felt good with the strength in QBO in the United States. So we feel even more optimistic as we look at the balance of the year because the new innovations that are hitting, we think, are going to add more fuel to the fire. And so I think if you look at QBO core in the United States, it's continuing to produce strong results with some cool innovations coming. The second piece is, we have QuickBooks Self-Employed that's going to add more fuel to the fire in the United States. And of course we do have desktop migrators. In the first quarter, we got a little bit of a bump there with these operating system upgrades. The migrators were up about 50% year-over-year. Last year they were up 25% overall. So that's always a little bit of tailwind as well, but we feel good about the United States and the QBO sub outlook as we look for the balance of the fiscal year. Sterling Auty : And then just one follow-up. In terms of some of the new functionality that you are bringing into QBO, do you expect any of that will actually have a material positive impact on the renewal rates as well? Brad Smith : We hope so. One of things we do know is that there is an important problem that customer has and it's one of the top things they have requested and then we solve that problem well with a new feature, it improves retention. And we fundamentally believe that the things we have narrowed in on are some of the most important and frequently asked feature requests. And so I feel good that the team not only has narrowed in on the right problems, but I also like the early results we are getting back in terms of customer feedback on those new features. So our goal is to continue to push retention up and I think it will continue to help us do that. Sterling Auty : Thank you. Brad Smith : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Macdonald of First Analysis. Your line is open. Jim Macdonald : Yes. Thanks guys. Could you give us a little more on the quarterly shift? You said one point of tax into the January quarter. And could you talk about what the -- is that just taken out of the next quarter? I mean 1% of what? Neil Williams : Yes. Hi Jim, this is Neil. The way the calendar falls in 2017, January 31 is actually on a Tuesday. In 2016 it fell on a Saturday. And we know a lot of people do their tax returns over the weekend and actually file them on Mondays. So when we factor in 2017, getting the full 31 days of January into our first quarter, it would make our growth rate, the way we look at it for TurboTax revenue in Q2 about a point or so higher than the growth rate we posted for last year. So I know getting seasonality right consumer tax is always a challenge for you guys and so just to let you know the way we see it playing out, is we would see our second quarter growth in consumer tax about a point or so better than the growth rate we posted last year, just because there are a couple of extra days customers can actually file their returns taking into the weekend into account and getting them into our Q2, it's a total shift from Q3 to Q2. It doesn't change the full-year outlook. It doesn't mean any more taxpayers or anything like that. It's just an anomaly with the way the calendar falls and the way consumers have time to work on their returns. Jim Macdonald : But just to clarify, so last year there was a shift and a big shift. So you had a big growth of consumer tax due to the shift back. So you are saying, it's going to be 1% more than the 30% last year? Neil Williams : Yes. Last year was actually a return to more normalized trends after the year before that having a delay with the IRS opening to receive return. So we kind of use 2016 as being a more normalized Q2 for us in terms of consumer tax revenue. And so yes, so a point or so above that. Jim Macdonald : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Colville of Arete Research. Your line is open. Patrick Colville : Hi guys. Great quarter. Thank you so much for taking my question. Can we just go back on the desktop unit growth and why the drivers that we saw this quarter wouldn't persist through the fiscal year? Brad Smith : Okay. Patrick, I am going to ask you repeat the first part again because you cut in and out a little bit and I couldn't hear what the particular product line you are asking about was, please? Patrick Colville : Sure. On the desktop unit growth, why the drivers that we saw this quarter wouldn't persist through the fiscal year? Brad Smith : Got it. Okay. Well, we fundamentally believe that a lot of the goodness we saw was the result of the operating system changes from both Windows and Apple. We saw Windows 10 upgrades and we saw the Mac OS upgrades driving a lot of this early strength. And so we think that a lot of that, if you just look at the natural upgrade cycle that's probably occurred, there will be a little bit of strength potentially here in Q2, but as we look at it for the balance of the year, we don't think it's going to persist through all four quarters. So that's really the hypothesis we have at this point. Patrick Colville : Got it. And can I just ask a quick follow-up on the tax business, just to help non-U.S. based analysts. So tax simplification, if that were to happen, I probably see that driving share shift to the DIY category, but probably also driving ASPs a little bit lower. I mean, is that right? Brad Smith : Well, first of all we do agree with you. We think tax simplification would drive more people to basically do the taxes themselves. In terms of whether it would ASP lower, there are other value-added services that we provide that basically help consumers say, I am willing to pay for that particular service. And so we don't fundamentally believe that ultimately lead to a lower ASP. It basically puts more energy into what are the other services you can offer a tax filer that they are willing to pay more for and those are the things that our team has been leaning into over the last couple of years. So I would agree with the first concept, we don't believe it naturally suppresses ASP on the second concept. It just puts more innovation into areas beyond the actual tax filing itself. Patrick Colville : Awesome. Thank you very much. Brad Smith : You are welcome. Thank you Patrick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research Associates. Your question, please. Michael Millman : Some more tax. I guess the PATH is a concern at all. It's basically, word gets out on the street and people delay, but no big swing in terms of the full year. Would you agree with that? Well, at least you certainly would agree with second part. Brad Smith : Yes. Michael, we agree with the second part. I do know there are family that are hoping to get their money as soon as they can and that's important. So we don't take that lightly, neither does the IRS or the rest of industries. So we want try to help them get that, but I think to your second point, it doesn't change the outcome of the full year. And that's what we are looking at. Michael Millman : Okay. So some other questions then. I guess, version and retention time type of questions. I was wondering if you would give us some feel and maybe more than a feel on what you are seeing in conversion from people going to the website or are you in fact seeing more people go into the driving to the website? To what extent are you seeing conversion changes in free to priced? And then I have a couple retention questions, but we will start there. Brad Smith : Okay. Michael, first of all, I want to make sure, are we still on the tax topic here? Michael Millman : Yes. On tax. Brad Smith : Okay. Got you. I anticipated that, but obviously we don't have any real conversion and retention numbers to talk about at this moment, because we haven't kicked off the new-season. But if you go back to our Investor Day deck that we shared in the fall, we laid out some pretty good detail on the funnel and it's actually on page 63 of our Investor Day deck, just to let you know the specifics. And it talked about the fact, we had roughly 92 million people who came in and visited turbotax.com through tax season. And then it talked about how many of those converted into logins, then actually filed a return and then the net net on that. And you will see that we laid in there basically the improvements, the conversion at every step along the way and then the ultimate impact in retention. And I feel good about that and then the following page talks to your free to paid. Obviously, we introduced free back in 2004, 2005 and we were getting about $29 a return and making about 60% margin back then. Last year, even with the very aggressive Absolute Zero, we made $49 a return and margins were around 65%. And our free to pay continues to be muscle we have refined and developed. We haven't broken down the actual percent of how many of them we convert, but you can look at the aggregate number and see that not only we are driving the revenue per return, but we are also improving the margin. So that data is in that Investor Day material and hopefully you will get the chance to take a look at that and it will give you a little more specifics on each of the key areas. Michael Millman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shankar Subramaniam of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open Shankar Subramaniam : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I am asking the question on behalf of Kash. Just on online payment and online payroll, can you talk about the attach rates that you are seeing right now relative to fiscal year 2016? And where do you see that going, especially given the growth in SE? Do you see an inflection point where you can actually see the attach rate growing from here? Brad Smith : Sure Shankar. First of all, let me start with the reason why we try to talk about penetration rates is because we think that's the ultimate payoff and that leads to ecosystem revenue growth. And so right now, there is two big numbers that we look at. One is what's the QBO ecosystem revenue growth? And it's 26%, which is up a little from last quarter. And then the second piece is, what are the penetration rate of payroll and payment into the QuickBooks Online base? And those are currently 15% for payroll and 6% for payments. Lots of upside opportunity but good strength. Now one of the leading indicators is an attach rate. We are trying to pull back on that because attach rates get muddied. They get muddy because QuickBooks Self-Employed, by definition, does not have a payroll. They don't have any employees, but they go into the QuickBooks Online base and if you start doing the math, you will say, looks like we have got a problem here, attach is going down, but it's not. It's QuickBooks Self-Employed becoming a bigger part of the mix. The other thing that throws you off, if you talk about attach rates is, we will do promotions at times, whether it's a buy now without a bundle or it might even be something with accountants who in turn then get the customers start to think about payroll and payments down the road. And those can muddy the water. But I will answer the question on what are the attach rates right now. It was 15% in the quarter for payroll and it was 9% for payment. But you have to put that caveat next to it which is, we had a big mix of QuickBooks Self-Employed and we also had some growth outside the United States where we don't yet offer payroll and payments and those numbers are going to make the attach rate look a little bit distorted. So [indiscernible] 26% ecosystem growth, which is up from 25%, that's the real health indicator. Shankar Subramaniam : Got it. There as one more question on the QBO sub growth for fiscal 2017. Given that the Q1 was above your expectation and all the other international growth in SE seeing strong traction, what's the put and take about exceeding your expectations for the fiscal 2017? Do you see more optimism that that's probably a conservative estimate and you can actually exceed it? Or is that more realistic target even with your new data? Brad Smith : Well, if you go back and look at what it would take for us to deliver the 2 million to 2.2 million subs, it would subscriber growth between 32% to 40%. And right now we just clocked 41% in Q1, which is an uptick from last quarter. And then we did walk through some of these innovations we have in the market now that we have introduced that we think gives us confidence that we are going to be able to deliver that 2 million to 2.2 million. It's still too early in the game for us to say hey, our confidence is now that we are going to go past the 2 million to 2.2 million, but hopefully it gives you enough assurance to say, you can see momentum in the base growing and you can hear the innovations coming. And honestly, it gives me a little bit of confidence to hear that the question is now, are you going to hit the number and now, it's actually are you actually going to exceed the number? We feel good about the things in the pipeline, but it's too early for us to say that we are going to be looking at raising guidance. Shankar Subramaniam : Got it. Thanks. Brad Smith : Okay. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, I am not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith : Yes. Thanks Lateef. I will tell you, we are encouraged with the strong start to the fiscal year and we really do feel like we have some momentum building with some new innovations in the market. But that said, you all know as well, our biggest quarters are still ahead of us. But we are looking forward to that whistle blowing and getting into peak season. I want to thank everybody for your questions today. And for those who are in the United States and celebrating Thanksgiving next week, we want to wish you a happy holiday. For everyone else, take care and we will speak with you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates John S. Byun - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Latif, and I will beer conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's second quarter 2017 conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Intuit's Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Mr. Natoli? Jerry Natoli - Intuit, Inc.: Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's second quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. I'm here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO; and Neil Williams, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I'll turn the call to Brad. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thanks, Jerry, and thanks all of you for joining us. Our second fiscal quarter once again reflected strong momentum across the business. QuickBooks Online subscribers and online ecosystem revenue demonstrated continuing acceleration from prior periods. As a result, we now expect third quarter QBO subscribers to be roughly 2 million, which had been the low-end of our original guidance for the full fiscal year. Looking beyond Q3, we now expect to exit the fiscal year with 2.2 million subscribers, which had been the high-end of that range. I'll talk more about what's driving these results in a minute, but given its tax season, let's focus there first. Despite the slow start to tax season, we remain confident it's simply a shift in timing, with the do-it-yourself software category and TurboTax performing well season-to-date. This timing shift did lead us to update our outlook for the quarter while reaffirming our full-year guidance. Each tax year is different. This one's no exception. The IRS data released this morning showed total e-filed returns are down 13% with self-prepared e-files down 11% and assisted e-files down 16%. When you compare these results to the data that we released today, the conclusion we reach is that do-it-yourself category is performing better than assisted and we are performing well within the do-it-yourself category. So it's helpful to put our season-to-date results into this context. Now, let me take a minute and remind you the four main drivers for the consumer tax business. The first is a total number of returns filed with the IRS. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. The third is our share within the do-it-yourself software category, and the fourth is the average revenue per return. Total returns filed with the IRS have grown on average 1% per year over the last five years. Now, we've grown quite a bit faster than that by focusing on growing the do-it-yourself software category and then growing our share within that category. So despite the slow start to this season, do-it-yourself software is once again growing faster than other methods and our volumes suggest that we are performing well within the category. Now, the question on everybody's mind is what's behind the slow start to the filing season? There could be several reasons. The IRS suggested in its release that the PATH Act has led some to delay their tax filings. Now, as a reminder, the PATH Act is new legislation in service to fighting tax fraud that delayed refund processing to February 15th or later for anyone who is filing for the earned income or additional child tax credit. Now, regardless of the root cause, we remain laser-focused on making sure we have the best offerings and an awesome end-to-end experience for our customers. Now there's no question this is a fiercely competitive tax season with new entrants joining the completely free category. Free offerings are not new to the category and they're not new to us, and our strategy to win with free remains unchanged. We are firm believers that not all free products are the same. Having the best free offer and a delightful end-to-end experience is what sets us apart. With Absolute Zero, we continue to believe that we have that winning experience. It's an alternative that is innovative for than 60 million people who file a simple return and may be overpaying for this service somewhere else. In fact, roughly 30 million of these 60 million Americans visit a tax store or a tax professional simply because they have a nagging question. In the end, they pay hundreds of dollars to file their taxes. This is where SmartLook comes in, providing access to an expert at the touch of a screen for a much lower cost. Now this is simply one of the many innovations that our tax team delivered this season. Other innovations include improving data import through taking a picture on a smartphone, while continuing to expand available W-2 and 1099 forms for direct download. We've also been applying machine learning and artificially intelligent algorithms to the data to get maximum deductions in less time. We're transforming TurboTax from an application to a platform, with our first partner, providing the ability for customers to refinance their student loan at a much lower rate. And we're delivering a free credit score to all TurboTax customers. On top of these innovations, we also introduced TurboTax Self-Employed this season. This offering includes a 12-month subscription to our QuickBooks Self-Employed accounting solution, connecting our market-leading QuickBooks platform to TurboTax. So to put a bow around the tax season to date, we remain confident about the plans we have in place. When it's all said and done, we know taxpayers will still need to file by April 18, so we're focused on executing with excellence. On the ProConnect side, we continue to focus on winning with multi-service accountants who do both books and tax. We're off to a strong start, and our important accountant relationships are helping to drive QuickBooks growth opportunities. Shifting to Small Business, we continue to be pleased with the growth in our QuickBooks Online ecosystem. Subscriber growth is accelerating, driven by product and platform innovation, improved product market fit outside of the United States, and a further expansion of our addressable market by targeting the self-employed segment. Total QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 49% in the quarter, up from 41% growth in the first quarter, and now shows more than 1.8 million subs. Outside the United States, our subscriber base grew 61% year over year to approximately 370,000 paying subscribers, which is up from 50% growth in Q1. We saw a notable pickup in markets where our product market fit meets our test of readiness, including the UK, Australia, and Canada. In fact, both the UK and Canada surpassed 100,000 subscribers in Q2. We introduced several innovations on the QuickBooks Online platform this quarter, including a complete re-imagination of QuickBooks.com and the QuickBooks Online first-time use experience; all in an effort to increase awareness, trials, and conversion. This is complemented by a new matchmaking service that connects small businesses with an accountant. In addition, we're also building momentum behind QuickBooks Self-Employed. Roughly 180,000 of our QuickBooks Online subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed, up from 110,000 subs last quarter and 50,000 subscribers just one year ago. In the quarter, we expanded QuickBooks Self-Employed to Canada, adding another major geography to the current distribution that we have in the United States, the UK, and Australia. Finally, we launched a new QuickBooks Self-Employed and TurboTax experience as well. While it's early days for all of these innovations, the accelerating growth gives us confidence that our strategy is working. In fact, online ecosystem revenue posted 30% growth in the quarter, up from 26% in Q1. To continue this momentum, we're investing, investing to improve the experience for customers and partners while getting the message out to more potential customers through events like QuickBooks Connect. Our first QuickBooks Connect conference outside the United States will be held in the UK in March, with Australia and Canada soon to follow. So with that overview, I'm going to hand it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details. R. Neil Williams - Intuit, Inc.: Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $1,016 million, up 10% year over year; GAAP operating income of $22 million versus $42 million a year ago; Non-GAAP operating income of $106 million versus $114 million a year ago; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.05 versus $0.09 last year; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.26, up from $0.25 last year. These results reflect a revenue shift we announced on February 8. Turning to the business segments; Consumer Tax revenue was $285 million for Q2. Brad already walked you through our analysis of the season so far. TurboTax processed e-files were down 10% through February 18, performing slightly better than the do-it-yourself category. We remain confident in our overall plans for the year and for Consumer Tax revenue to grow 6% to 8% in fiscal 2017. ProConnect revenue was $99 million for Q2. We continue to expect revenue to be roughly flat in fiscal 2017. While the growth rate was stronger than our long-term expectation this quarter, it was driven largely by the timing of forms availability, which we expect to normalize by fiscal year-end. Moving over to Small Business; total Small Business revenue grew 12% for the quarter. As Brad mentioned, QuickBooks Online subscriber growth remained strong and we exceeded our guidance for the quarter, reaching 1,871,000 subscribers, up 49% year over year. Small Business online ecosystem revenue grew 30% for the quarter, accelerating from 26% in Q1. That online ecosystem revenue growth is at the high end of our 25% to 30% expectation that we've talked about and is evident of our ability to improve the monetization of our online subscribers. Our online payroll and payments businesses remained healthy. Online payroll subscribers grew 19% in Q2. Online active payments customers grew 13% and online payments charge volume grew 17%. Now, you'll note that our attach rates for both payroll and payments dipped in Q2, coinciding with continued acceleration of global and self-employed QBO subscribers. As we've discussed before, these subscribers don't have the same attach characteristics as our traditional QBO subscriber base. That's why attach rates aren't as useful as they've been in the past to predict revenue for this business. Our desktop ecosystem revenue grew 6%, while units declined 5% year over year. For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect units to decline modestly and desktop ecosystem revenue to be up slightly to flat. Turning to financial principles, we continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15%. We ended the quarter with approximately $637 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet. Our first priority is investing for customer growth. We also intend to use our strong Q3 cash flow to repay $500 million in senior notes when they come due in March. We return cash to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased $198 million worth of shares in the second quarter and $2 billion remains on our authorization. The board approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per share, payable on April 18, 2017. You can find our fiscal 2017 Q3 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. Note that this guidance takes into account the tax unit performance since January 31, as described in our unit release today. We reiterated our full-year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance. As a reminder, we expect to provide a final tax unit update in April after the tax season ends. And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thanks, Neil. To recap, we're pleased with our performance in the first half of fiscal 2017. We're in the heat of another competitive tax season but there's a lot of time left on the season but there's a lot of left on the clock. We remain confident in our ability to compete and win, driven by our laser focus on a delightful product experience that puts more money in our customers' pockets. We're continuing to gain momentum in our QuickBooks Online franchise as well, with strong growth in the U.S. and select markets around the world, driving acceleration in subscriber growth and in online ecosystem revenue. We're also expanding the category with QuickBooks Self-Employed and our new TurboTax Self-Employed offering connects our TurboTax and QuickBooks platforms, providing further runway for growth across our ecosystem. That's the halftime report. And with that, let's open it up to you to hear what's on your mind. Latif? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question and nice job on the QuickBooks Online side of the equation. You look really strong there. I wanted to dig in a little bit on that in terms of the profitability of QuickBooks Online on a going forward basis. If we look at the contribution margins you gave, you did see a little bit of a dip in margins from Q1 into Q2. You talked about on the call some additional investments that you're doing in getting the word out in sort of the distribution side of the equation there. How should we think about the profitability of QuickBooks Online on a going forward basis, particularly as you see such good growth in emerging areas like Self-Employed and international? R. Neil Williams - Intuit, Inc.: Hi, Keith. This is Neil. There's no question that in the newer markets as growth ramps up the profitability is less in QBO than it is in the U.S. when we have a more mature, stable, traditional base, but what you're seeing is the growth rate accelerate in our online ecosystem certainly from Q1 to Q2 and over last year. And as we've talked about in the past, more of the revenue in the online ecosystem is coming from the accounting product itself, from QBO. And as these customers come off the trial period, as they get past their anniversary cycle, you're seeing some of the increased revenue kick in and that's what's really driving some of the growth in the revenue and in the profitability. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Keith, this is Brad. I just want to add a couple of points for you. As we've talked about these emerging markets, one of the key indicators is lifetime value to cost to acquire a customer, LTV to CAC. As you know the FASB standard is anything north of 3 to continue to invest. Right now in the United States, our QBO LTV to CAC is 5.5. If you add in desktop it's 6.9, and if you actually do a worldwide blended number, it's 4.5. So we feel good that we have a proxy and know that we're driving towards good profitable growth. And the second thing is Neil and I worked with the businesses and we have a guideline for the Small Business Group that's keeping that business unit contribution while we're in this investment phase around 40%. It may go up or down a point or two based upon choices we make, but that's a very good healthy margin for a business that's in good growth but also continuing to deliver the kind of rigor we want on the bottom line. So I just wanted to add that to the two pieces that Neil just put out there as well. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. So when we look at the 2 percentage point decline sequentially in Q1 into Q2 in that contribution margin, is that just noise on a quarter-to-quarter mix or some recent investments, or is that just the current mix shift down in terms of Self-Employed and international? R. Neil Williams - Intuit, Inc.: Keith, the way I would think about that is more a function of the rapid growth and the acceleration of growth there where clearly there have been some investments to drive that growth both in marketing and in product. And at the earlier days, as you know from the subscriber live period, they're not paying the full rate in many cases. So I think it's more a function of the growth curve and where we are on it. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, thanks. That's very helpful and again, really nice job building out that subscriber base. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thank you, Keith. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Hey, guys. I'm going to focus a bit on the tax side. Brad, I was a little bit confused by the quote in the release of the data, the Dan Wernikoff quote about TurboTax e-file returns down 10% versus prior year. Could you clarify that relative to the table? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: I'm going to have Neil and the team here reconcile it with the table. But as you know, one of the things we try to do is translate our unit growth into e-files sent. And you know the noise here. You followed the business for a lot of years. A desktop unit has an average of two e-files each, and then a TurboTax unit is one-for-one. So what we try to do is since the IRS reports the number of e-files received, we try to then tell you how many have we actually processed. And what you saw with the IRS data released this morning is that self-prepared e-files were down about 11% year over year through February 17. Our data shows that we're down about 10% through February 18. And so the net-net on that is we're basically holding to slightly up in terms of our share in the category. Now, looking at the table, is there something in the table that we need to clarify? R. Neil Williams - Intuit, Inc.: It's just basically the fact that the units are including the retail units... Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Got it. R. Neil Williams - Intuit, Inc.: ...where you typically get two files from each one of those, and those come in later. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yes, so, Scott, right now what the headline is units are down 5%. Our e-files, if you translate that into e-files, are down 10%. And then the IRS on an apples-to-apples is down roughly 11% for the self-prepared category, which basically says what Dan's quote is, we feel good about how we're performing thus far season to date. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it, thanks for the clarification. That's what I thought. I'm just curious, and I'm not sure how much clarity you'll provide. Did the one day make a difference on you comping February 18 versus IRS February 17 this year? And if you don't want to answer that directly, just what have you seen in the subsequent days? Do we have the same decelerating negative trend that has shown up in the first few weeks of the IRS data for you in TurboTax? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: No, thanks for the question, Scott. Actually we have reconciled against the IRS, and the answer is it does not change materially the outcome that we just described, which is we're performing slightly better than the DIY category and certainly better than the overall IRS returns and much better than assisted. So no real material difference there in that 1-day difference. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: All right. Great, thanks. And then lastly, if I could sneak another in, just the marketing this year and the slow start to the tax season, Neil, I guess for you are you guys calling any audibles on marketing because we have this shift? How is the timing of the marketing and magnitude of it on the tax side this year? Thanks so much. R. Neil Williams - Intuit, Inc.: Scott, we've definitely made some audibles, as you call it, to be sure that the messaging is out in the market at the time when customers are shopping and deciding to file their taxes. So we've made some choices to extend our advertising and marketing a little longer in the season than we might have expected at the very beginning. But we've done some internal reallocation of our resources and we think it's still going to fit inside the same resource envelope we had when we started the year for the full company. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: All right, great. Thanks, guys. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jesse Hulsing of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you for taking my question. It looks like, by my math, that QBO growth accelerated internationally within self-employed and also in the U.S. ex self-employed. And I wanted to drill into what might be driving that. So I guess maybe this is for Brad. Do you think it's due to a ramp up in marketing or are you seeing an increase in velocity and conversion versus your expectations? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Jesse. The answer is we're seeing strength across the board. What's really driving is the U.S. is up about 36%, outside the U.S., you just mentioned the acceleration from 50% last quarter to 61%. And then you add on top of that QuickBooks Self-Employed, which in the quarter added about 70,000 active users and that's more than all of last year's 60,000. But the real driver behind it is product market fit. As you know, we have a test of readiness, which is in every market, are we able to deliver the benefit the customer says is most important and is our ability to deliver that benefit better than the best alternatives in the market? And once we see that light go green, then we lean in to the accountant channel and we'll start to make more increased investments in advertising. So the product is really driving the acceleration of velocity and then we put topspin on it by putting more marketing into those markets because we feel good about the product market fit. And that is currently in Canada, the UK, and Australia. And we've mentioned to you, we haven't taken our eye off of the ball in India, France, and Brazil. And we see a springtime window for those to go green and then we'll start to lean in there as well. So overall, it is accelerating velocity. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. And a couple of quick follow-ups. First, how is retention trending if you look at it on a \u2013 I guess, on a cohorted basis? I think it'd been improving across the board prior to this quarter. And second, along the same lines, how is ARPU trending on a cohorted basis within each QuickBooks segments? Thank you. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You're welcome. So retention continues to look healthy for us even with this influx of new users, we're still looking at that first year cohort of around 70%. As they anniversary off that first year, it's pushed out of that high 70s and now it's tickling the 80% range. So it continues to get healthier. ARPU for us is no different than what Neil shared at Investor Day. We continue to see the cohorts of QBO or non-U.S. QBO or Self-Employed continue to remain healthy. When you put them in the mix, it looks like ARPU is coming down a little bit. That's why we say this is more about staying focused on the ecosystem revenue growth, which went from 26% up to 30% and we think that's the best indicator of the long-term health of this business. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, Brad. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Jesse. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks so much. I have two. Maybe first just on tax, I know it's early, Brad, but just wandered what are you seeing in terms of price realization just given the more aggressive competitive environment this season. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: I think, Ross, the first is, this is a competitive season but it was not unanticipated. I mean, many of us were talking in the off-season and we knew that everyone was going to be coming after the market aggressive. But as I shared in my opening comments, free offerings are not new to the category and certainly not new to us. It comes down to who has the best end-to-end experience and product experience and we feel good about our position right now. The other thing that we talked about going into the season, and Dan Wernikoff did a wonderful job at Investor Day, is we're looking to add more value to our product lineup to attract higher value customers into the category and ultimately into TurboTax's franchise. So SmartLook right now is focused on those customers who've historically paid hundreds of dollars to go to an assisted method and we're bringing them into our category. The other thing is TurboTax Self-Employed right now is at an $89 price point. And by hooking that up with QuickBooks Self-Employed, we're getting more of those kinds of customers as well. So I think you're going to see price realization continue to be a little healthier, if we continue to bring these higher value customers into the category while we remain competitive on free on the low end. So at the end of the season, we'll have a better read on that. But that's our strategy going in is winning more share of dollars, while also continuing to extend our lead in share of units and that's our multi-pronged approach. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's great. And then just my follow-up; obviously really strong QBO sub adds really across the board. I wanted just to double click on the core U.S. sub adds, which I think were about 116,000. That's by far and away the best number you've ever put out for that number. Were there any particular promotions or was there any other driver in your mind of why that stepped up so materially? Thanks so much. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Actually, I am excited to say that that team has really leaned in to the product experience. In fact, they prioritized really making the first-time use experience from new-to-the-franchise customers amazing. They've had goals they put in place to get to a first P&L in five minutes or less; the ability to send an invoice quickly. They've spent a lot of time looking at what the best indicators are to someone who'll turn into an active user. And that's really what's driven the growth, not only in the U.S. but around the globe. It has not been increased promotions or anything else. It really has been the product. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's great. Congratulations. Good numbers. Thank you. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nemeroff of Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Christopher Rochester - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. This is actually Chris Rochester on for Michael. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding the recently announced partnership between Intuit Canada and Uber, could you maybe discuss any details on the economic relationship there? Or is it more going to be lead gen for SE? And is there any chance of that the relationship expands to the U.S.? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yeah, actually, Chris, we have a relationship with Uber already in the United States and we simply expanded it into Canada. We have been working with Uber over the tax season last year and then more aggressively in the post season to try to make sure that we're helping them with their drivers, be able to separate their personal from their business expense, to be able to keep a mileage log that was up-to-date and active and have the ability for them to file their taxes. And on average, they're saving about $4,300 in tax savings by using our product. The other thing is the benefit for Uber is many times last year, the number one call they got from those who were driving for their service was hey, how do I \u2013 what do I owe for taxes? So the partnership is a win for them, it's a win for the driver and it's certainly a win for us. And the relationship has been in place in the U.S. and obviously, you mentioned the one in Canada as well. And we look to continue to expand that and many other relationships as we focus on the Self-Employed segment. Christopher Rochester - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great, that's helpful. Just to clarify also, a quick follow-up maybe on the SE number. Is there any chance you could split that out between U.S. and international, just to get a cleaner sort of QBO U.S. number? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yeah. R. Neil Williams - Intuit, Inc.: I would say, Chris, we might consider doing that in Investor Day. We'll think about it toward the end of the year and see if that makes sense. We always reconsider updating those statistics at the end of the year to help you in your modeling, so we'll take a look at that. Christopher Rochester - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: All right. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. You mentioned some of the new entrants on the competitive landscape. I'm just kind of curious, looking at the change in advertising, I think this year out of H&R Block, where are you seeing the competitive pressures? Is it the new entrants or the existing, established players like H&R Block? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Sterling, it's across the board. I think everyone continues to lean in and put their best game on the field and that's good for the category. If you go back and look over three decades, any time a lot of players either get more competitive, they're already in the game or new entrants come in, everyone leans into the advertising and marketing muscle and that gets more people to raise their head and say, hey, I'm paying hundreds of dollars to go to this service, why don't I try that instead? I think this is going to be net-net good for the category. It's going to get more people into the do-it-yourself category, and then it comes down to who has the best offering. But right now, of course, you've seen H&R Block, a really worthy competitor, someone we have respect for out there, and they've been aggressive this year. You've got new entrants coming in. and of course, we've been out there banging the drum as well. So I think net \u2013 we're getting a lot of people excited about the do-it-yourself category, which is good news for the long term. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then you talked about penetrating the multi-service accountants. Is there a way to think about what portion of that CPA market that represents? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: We may have shared \u2013 we'll have to go back and see. I'm trying to go from memory, if we actually sized that in our Investor Day materials. I can't remember off the top of my head how many of the 400,000 firms are multi-service firms. I'm thinking it's somewhere in the two hundred and some thousand, but did we size that? R. Neil Williams - Intuit, Inc.: It's a little less than that. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: I'm sorry. I'm going to be guessing, Sterling. Let's get that answer and then we'll make sure we get that out to everybody. But I thought in Cece's section that she had sized it in the ProConnect update. Maybe... Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No worries. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Okay, sorry about that. It's a good number. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's okay. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: It's a healthy number. I'll tell you that. It's not 10. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I hear you. Thanks a lot, guys. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Your line is open. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Thanks, guys. Could you talk about how you're thinking about revenue this year for TurboTax versus units, anything from the offers or mix or price? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Jim, we've had a pretty consistent set of guiding principles out there, and then I'll add the asterisks onto this year, as we shared at Investor Day. So the principles are the four main drivers are the number of units or the number of returns filed with the IRS and then what percent of those are actually going into the do-it-yourself category. Underneath that, we fight for share and then ultimately we try to get a good revenue per return. As we were going into this year, we always say we like to see units grow faster than revenue and we like to see the category grow faster than the alternative method because that sets up a good lifeline for future monetization. Now, what we did this year in addition to that \u2013 so nothing has changed in our strategy. What we've done in addition to that is we've leaned into higher value opportunities. So SmartLook is trying to get these higher paying customers out of the assisted method, and we've also leaned in TurboTax Self-Employed. So we'll see what that does to return at the end of the year and ultimately what that does to revenue, but we're still striving to have healthy unit growth. And in a good situation, we'd like to have units outpace revenue. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: And just as a follow-up, do you think the new products like the refinance your student loan offer and those kind of products will have any significant impact in that delta this year? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: I'd say, Jim, it's early days this year. We're getting a lot of good learning, and this is the first of a platform strategy you saw play out in QuickBooks that we're now bringing to TurboTax. So I think it's going to be fairly immaterial this year, but I think we're going to leave here with a wiser set of ideas and thoughts as we enter into next season, and we're playing that one for the long game. So I'd say it'll be relatively immaterial this year. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Okay, great. Thanks. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You're welcome, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thank you. I guess some more tax stuff. I guess since the last questioner brought up H&R Block, I was wondering if indeed you're seeing some competition from increased RAs, and in their case, Watson. In addition, I was interested in what you're seeing in terms of people going into your website to check on the product or how that rates with what you've seen in the past. And in the same vein, I was interested in what you're seeing in conversion and where you stand on retention. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Hey, Michael. I appreciate the questions as always. Let me start first with we have a lot of respect for all of our competition. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, everyone out there is being aggressive. Let me talk specifically to IBM Watson that you referred to. We've been talking about machine learning and artificial intelligence for some time. In fact, it's not new, and we've been leaning into it aggressively since 2010. To give you a couple of stats, we have over 100 patents pending right now on machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. We have 30 already in the market. These are algorithms. These are machine learning capabilities that do things like helping somebody in TurboTax understand quickly whether they should just go with the standardized deduction or do itemized deductions. And that could save as much as 40% of the time it takes to do the return. In QuickBooks, we have this thing called Smart Sort, which is the ability to automatically categorize whether something is a personal or a business expense, which allows you to basically make the right kinds of decisions when you file a Schedule C. And there's a whole host of other things that we're doing with artificial intelligence. So we are excited about the capabilities, we're always leaning into the future. And for us, this isn't a new announcement, we've been talking about it for some time. And it's been showing up, we believe, in not only our product scores, but also in our market share gains. The second is on the website. Right now, we haven't broken down our funnel metrics. We'll do that and we always do that pretty transparently at Investor Day. We don't tend to do it midseason. But you heard us reaffirm our confidence for the full year. So that gives you some insight into how we're feeling about her funnel metrics, which include conversion and retention. I think beyond that, at this point, we need to see how the full season plays out. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Great. Thank you, Brad. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Byun of UBS. Your line is open. John S. Byun - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, thank you. So I think this question may have been asked in a slightly different way, but I wanted to try again. In terms of the tax trends, given the slow start, I mean, how do you feel about the recovery pace so far? Realizing you really need the full year, but is that going at the pace that you need it to, or does that need to accelerate in the back half of this season? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: John, thank you for that question. I think the solace that we all take some comfort in is that everyone has till April 18 to file. So whether they've jump in right now and it's coming back at the pace we hope, or they're going to wait until April 13, April 14, April 15 and dive across the finish line. We're prepared for any of those scenarios. We're out there, as Neil said, making sure that our message is out there today as they're making decisions. But we're going to stay in the game all the way to April 18. I think there's a lot of pace that's going to have to pick up between where we sit today and April 18. But that deadline is coming and so I think it's just a matter of when. John S. Byun - UBS Securities LLC : Great, that's helpful. Then as a follow-up, the competition, specifically Credit Karma and H&R Block are doing a lot more on the free side. I mean, have you done anything to tweak your execution or any sort of response in your day-to-day? And that's it for me. Thank you. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: No, you're welcome, John. I didn't mean to interrupt you. I was going to say we came in anticipating pretty aggressive season and we knew that there were going to be players that were going to mirror our Absolute Zero. And so we haven't had to tweak anything from a product perspective. As Neil did suggest though, we did start to make some adjustments to how we get our marketing message out there since the season got started a little later than we had anticipate. But we've been able to reallocate resources and kind of self-fund that, so that's really been the adjustment. Now, you might imagine we have a lot of contingency plans in place, if-then scenarios and those are sort of still on our back pocket. And we'll just keep an eye on the competition and we'll make the right kinds of decisions as things move. John S. Byun - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks again. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Okay. I did have one \u2013 I realized, Michael, I did not mean to not answer one of your questions. This is for Michael Millman. You had asked about RAs, the refund advances. I think that we talked about this in the past that we exited that refund advance or refund anticipation loan business about a decade ago. We didn't feel that that was the right approach for families who were looking to get money in their pocket. And so ultimately, we haven't had that offering for some time and during that period of time, the do-it-yourself category has grown and we've gained market share. So we don't feel we're at a disadvantage this year any different than we have been for the last decade. We think the category is still going to grow and we're still going to gain share. Latif. Were there any others? Operator : I'm not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yeah, I'll be happy to do that. First of all, we want to thank everybody for your questions today. Obviously, we're still on the midst of this peak season and we do like the momentum, we're continuing to build in Small Business and you heard us reiterate our confidence in the game plan for tax. We all know there's a lot of time left on the clock and your questions suggest there's still a lot of time for people to get their tax filing in. We know that's going to have to happen between now and April 18. So we're looking forward to staying laser-focused and executing and we'll catch up with you on the after calls as well as talk again at the end of tax season. So thanks, everybody and have a good weekend. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

My name is Brian and I will be the conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Intuit's Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Mr. Natoli? Jerome Natoli : Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Conference Call. I'm here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO; and Neil Williams, our CFO.  Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brad. Brad Smith : All right. Thanks, Jerry and thanks to all of you for joining us. We're pleased with our performance in our third fiscal quarter. As you know, this is our largest quarter of the year and we successfully delivered strong financial results in a complicated tax season. Exiting the quarter, our Consumer Tax revenue was up 9% year-to-date and is on track to finish at the high end of our guidance range for the full fiscal year. We're also driving continued momentum in our Small Business franchise with QuickBooks Online subscriber growth accelerating to 59% and over 2.2 million subscribers which is above the upper end of the target we had established for the full fiscal year. As a result, we're raising our outlook for QBO subscribers to $2.3 million. We're raising our full year revenue guidance and we're tightening the EPS range to the high end. All in all, we're on track to deliver another good year. With that overview, let me click down into the drivers of our performance in the third quarter, beginning with our tax results. This tax season proved to be eventful from beginning to end, but with the late start to the tax filing compared to prior years, a renewed competitive environment and a free category, a new IRS requirement designed to reduce fraud. The combination of these factors were reflected in the 4 drivers of the tax business that we discussed with you on a regular basis. The first driver is overall growth in the number of tax returns filed with the IRS. The latest IRS data indicate that total returns are down slightly, below the 0% to 1% growth that we have forecasted. If this trend plays out for the remainder of the tax filing year, it will be the slowest growth in total tax return since the year 2013. The second driver is the percentage of returns filed using do-it-yourself software. To-date, DIY category share has grown about 0.2 points, less than the 1.2 points that we expected. With that said, DIY category growth once again outpaced the year-over-year decline in the assisted tax prep methods. The third driver is TurboTax's share within the do-it-yourself category. After strong share gains the past several years, our share with DIY e-file this season was flat. This performance is below the 1 point of share gain that we strive to achieve each year and we're already designing innovative ways to accelerate customer growth as we look ahead to next season. The fourth driver is revenue per return which has been stronger than our multiyear average of 1%. Our pricing was relatively stable this season so the benefit resulted from a mix shift to the higher end of our product lineup. So while the drivers of our tax results played out differently than expected, I am proud of the agile execution and innovation the team delivered this season. If you recall the game plan that we shared at our Investor Day in the fall, we outlined the plan to extend our leadership in do-it-yourself tax, began transforming the assisted tax category and ran experiments to evolve beyond tax through a tested open platform. This season, we made progress across several fronts. We leaned into SmartLook, providing broad access to an expert with the simple touch of a finger at a much lower cost than going to a tax store. We also began driving value to the broader Intuit ecosystem, leveraging the credit score functionality in Mint to provide more than 1.3 million free credit scores to TurboTax customers this season. And we introduced the Self-Employed bundle of QuickBooks and TurboTax, targeting the freelancer and gig economy, driving strong results which I'll discuss in greater detail in a minute. All of this was built on the investments we've made in innovation over the past several years in areas such as artificial intelligence where we applied for more than 100 patents and have more than 30 AI applications in market across the company. Putting the bill around Consumer Tax, we're exiting this season with strong financial results, although generated in ways that were different than what we'd expected. We'll learn from our experience this season and continue to invest in our multiyear strategy to deliver against the long term objectives that we set for ourselves. We'll share more details on our results and our long term strategy at our Annual Investor Day in the fall. With that overview on Consumer Tax, let's shift to the assisted tax result and ProConnect. This business delivered results that were better than our expectations with year-to-date revenue growth of 2%. ProConnect plays an important role across our ecosystem with approximately 60% of the TurboTax SmartLook agent being passed by our ProConnect tax experts in this season. We've also seen early success in driving QBO subscribers through our tax sales efforts, fostering growth within the QBO franchise. With that overview on tax, let me now shift to Small Business. Subscriber growth continued to accelerate, driven by improvement across our platform that serves self-employed, small businesses and accountants. We've also increased our marketing effectiveness and expanded our addressable footprint internationally in the self-employed segment. As I mentioned earlier, total QBO subscribers grew 59% in the quarter, up from 49% growth in the second quarter. Our TurboTax Self-Employed offering contributed 11 points to the subscriber growth.  We continue to drive strong growth in both our core U.S. business and international markets. Outside the U.S., our subscriber base grew 70% year-over-year to 433,000 subscribers. That's up from 61% growth in Q2. Within QuickBooks Online, the QuickBooks Self-Employed subscribers doubled to 360,000, up from 180,000 last quarter and 75,000 just one year ago. During Q3, we launched QuickBooks Self-Employed in Singapore, adding another geography to our lineup and we expect to launch in Hong Kong and South Africa soon. Finally, our TurboTax Self-Employed offering has contributed approximately 160,000 subscribers to the QuickBooks Self-Employed total so far this year. Our tax customer base is proving to be a great channel for reaching the self-employed and we know nearly 4 million TurboTax customers are self-employed tax filers. I'm also pleased to report that QuickBooks Self-Employed customers who come through the TurboTax channel have a higher product recommendation score as well. Our momentum in QBO subscriber growth is driving top line revenue with online ecosystem revenue growing 30% again this quarter, at the high end of our 25% to 30% target range. We expect online accounting to be the primary driver of online ecosystem revenue for the foreseeable future as we prioritize feeding the global market with QuickBooks Online. Add-on services such as payroll and payments, the blade to the QBO razor, certainly remain important and they'll play an increasingly larger role in later chapters, but our strategic priority at this time is getting more QBO razors in the market. This playbook should sound familiar because it served us well for decades in the QuickBooks Desktop franchises. Putting it all together, our strategy of a vibrant One Intuit Ecosystem is gaining real momentum. We're seeing proof points with more ecosystem connections between customers and products that are creating greater value for our customers and building sources and competitive advantage for Intuit. Whether it's TurboTax driving self-employed customers for QuickBooks, it's ProConnect accountants serving TurboTax customers through SmartLook or the Mint credit scores being delivered to TurboTax customers, we're unleashing the power of the many for the prosperity of one. You will hear more from us on this front in the coming months. But with that overview, I'm going to hand it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details. Neil Williams : Thanks, Brad and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $2.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year; GAAP operating income of $1.4 billion versus $1.3 billion a year ago; non-GAAP operating income of $1.5 billion versus $1.4 billion last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.70 versus $3.94 last year; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.90, up from $3.43 last year. As a reminder, our GAAP results last year included $0.68 per share from the sale of discontinued operations. Turning to the business segments. Consumer Tax revenue was up 10% in the quarter, 9% year-to-date. Our unit growth was 2% and we saw a mix shift in the higher end of our product lineup, increasing our average revenue per customer. We held share in the category this year, but we did not grow units faster than revenue. This is not consistent with our long term principle and we're addressing it in our strategy for next year. We've had questions on the difference between unit and e-file growth this season so let me explain. We grew units 2% this season, but our e-file growth was flat. New Internal Revenue Service security measures this tax year mandated the only way to e-file is to enter the prior year adjusted gross income or your existing filing pen. Many of our new customers had difficulty with this, causing them to print and mail their returns inside of e-filing. Although these returns were prepared with our software and customers paid for them, the mail returns are not included in e-file results reported by the IRS nor are they counted in our share calculations which are based on e-file returns. We saw at least an incremental 500,000 returns this year that were paid for, but not e-filed. ProConnect revenue was $168 million in Q3, down 8% from Q3 last year. This reflects the timing shifts from forms availability we discussed last quarter. Year-to-date, our ProConnect revenue was $327 million, a little better than our expectations and last year. Moving to Small Business. Total Small Business revenue grew 16% in the quarter. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth remained strong and we exceeded our guidance for the quarter and the full year, reaching 2,220,000 subscribers, up 59% year-over-year. TurboTax was a significant channel for QuickBooks Self-Employed in Q3, accounting for 11 points of growth. Small Business online ecosystem revenue grew 30% for the second consecutive quarter. This is at the high end of the 25% to 30% growth range we've talked about and is driven by continued growth of online accounting revenue. Our Online Payroll and payment businesses remained healthy, growing 19% and 9% this quarter, respectively. As we told you before, a portion of each of these businesses are attached to QuickBooks Online and a portion is made up of stand-alone customers who are not connected to QuickBooks.  Online Payroll revenue attached to QuickBooks makes up about 45% of Online Payroll revenue. That revenue grew 35% in the quarter, with subscriber growth of 21%. In contrast, Online Payroll revenue unattached to QuickBooks grew 1%. Online payments revenue attached to QuickBooks makes up about 60% of our online payments revenue. That revenue grew 33% in the quarter, with active payments customer growth up 47%. As we've mentioned in the past, we're not investing in acquiring stand-alone payments customers and that portion of the portfolio is declining. Revenue for these online payments customers not attached to QuickBooks fell 15%. Our Small Business desktop ecosystem revenue grew 12%. About 6 points of this revenue growth is related to a SKU we introduced at retail last year. This SKU gave desktop customers a QuickBooks license and the right to access QuickBooks Online service for one year at no additional charge. This required us to defer a portion of the related revenue. These rights expired in Q3, resulting in recognition of this revenue. Desktop units declined 15% year-over-year and units were 3% below last year on a year-to-date basis. For fiscal 2017, we expect QuickBooks Desktop units to decline mid-single digits and desktop ecosystem revenue to be up mid-single digits. That growth is driven by ratable revenue recognition and continued strength in our QuickBooks Enterprise business. Turning to our financial principles. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment growth of 15%. With approximately $1.6 billion in cash and investments in our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. Our goal is to drive double-digit revenue growth and to grow operating income in the mid-teens. We return excess cash to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately $90 million of shares in the third quarter and $1.9 billion remains on our authorization. We used some of our operating cash to repay $500 million in senior notes that matured in March and $150 million on our revolver. The board approved the dividend of 3 -- $0.34 per share payable on July 18, 2017. We're raising our full year QBO subscribers and total company revenue guidance and narrowing operating income and EPS to the high end of the range. We now expect total company revenue growth of 9% to 10% for the year. You can find our fiscal 2017 Q4 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith : Thank you, Neil. Q3 was another strong quarter for Intuit with a hard-fought tax season that brought some bright spots as well as opportunities to improve, but ultimately delivered at the high end of our revenue guidance for the tax business. Small Business continued to gain momentum with accelerating QBO subscriber growth leading to an increase in our full year subscriber outlook and online ecosystem revenue topping the high end of our 25% to 30% target range for the second consecutive quarter. Collectively, we're driving strong progress for the One Intuit Ecosystem strategy, creating greater value for our customers and building new sources of competitive advantage. So with that overview and summary, Brian, let's hand it back to you to hear what's on everybody's mind. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kasthuri Rangan : It looks like this additional discovery that you had for 4 million self-employed individuals that are also TurboTax customers, how near term of an opportunity would this be to the QBO franchise as regards your ability to make this something of a bigger -- I know 2.2 million is fantastic. But at what point in time are we looking for and shooting for a 5 million type target which all the more, given your disclosure, looks feasible given the correlation and the data that you uncovered? Brad Smith : Thank you, Kash. I love your optimism and your positive view on the business. We feel the same way about the opportunity with self-employed. We know that this is a secular trend that continues to build momentum around the globe. And we discovered in TurboTax, we do indeed have a channel with 4 million of those tax filers being self-employed and we discovered, now with the bundle, that this year was really the first full year having in that season that we know how to optimize that conversion and get more of those customers in the funnel. So we haven't put in the outlook out there yet. We'll talk more about fiscal year '18 in August. But like you, we see the real opportunity here and we think that this is just the early inning of what could be a long term growth driver for the company. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Nemeroff : Just digging in a little bit on the tax season. A lot of your paid subscribers in the next year come from your free filers in the previous year. So I'm wondering what, if any, impact you think that the flat market share in 2017 is going to impact the 2018 tax season? Brad Smith : Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. Let me start by saying that we do believe that we left opportunity on the table. We have very clear principles to grow our customers faster than our revenue and we want to continue to take share in the category. This year, we did not do either of those. We actually did not grow our customers faster than revenue when we held share. But I would also tell you that, that doesn't mean next year is not going to be a good year for us. If you go back to 2013, that was a year where we grew our units at about 3%. We stepped back. We took the lessons. We laid out a game plan. And in 2014, we grew units 9%, 3x. And I can assure you, we've got a highly motivated team. And as Neil would say, bad batch, not a bad recipe. So we're back to the cooking table and we're ready to do it again. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : Another tax question on -- on the SKU mix, is there any way you could give us a sense as to what your mix look like of -- the Free, the Deluxe, the Premier? Any color there? Is it -- was it a mix within those categories? Or did you actually see higher prices in certain categories that helped on the revenue per filing? Brad Smith : Yes, Walter. Let me break it down a little bit. And I'll break it into a 60, 20 and 20 sort of bucketing for you. The reason why we're able to still grow revenue at the high end of the range, 9% year-to-date, while we grow unit 2%, that's primarily because of mix. 60% of that effect was the fact that we did not get as many free, free customers as we set out to do every year. And as I just mentioned in my prior response, we're going to sharpen our pencils and get back at that next year because we want to continue to grow the category and we want to continue to grow share. So by taking free, free out of the mix, that means that your average revenue per return or revenue per customer for the remainder is going to be higher. That takes me to the 20% tranche. And that 20% is we have continued to get more sophisticated in finding ways to add value to customers that they're willing to pay for. Some of those may be prior year free customers, some of those could be existing pay customers that they see value bundles that they think were worthy of them actually paying and that's helped us increase our revenue. And then, the third bucket is the higher end of the product line, in particular TurboTax Self-Employed. With that success we just talked about QuickBooks Self-Employed, there's a real winner there and that's the most expensive or the highest priced product in our product lineup. So when you put that all together, it was fewer free, free which we actually view as an execution opportunity. We continue to get better at creating value that customers are willing to pay for and we're also seeing some early success at the higher end of our product line which we think bodes well for the future. Walter Pritchard : Got it. And then, just on -- for Neil, on the margin. So, I mean, I hear you talking about wanting to drive Small Business subscribers and you have a history of monetizing those over time which I'd agree. But I look at your margins in Small Business from Q1 to Q2 to Q3, they actually improved -- have improved every quarter here if I look year-over-year and you're showing some nice margin expansion in Q3 in Small Business over where you were last year. Is there something anomalous there? Or is that a -- are you able to kind of do both at once? Neil Williams : No. I think we're trying to balance, Walter, to do both at once. We have opportunities to grow and expand by investing in the product and marketing, but those have to be in a positive NPV. And so at the midpoint of our range this year, we think we will see maybe 50 basis points of margin expansion which I think is a really good balance between funding the growth opportunities we could see in front of us and take advantage of those and being true to our financial principles. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. Jesse Hulsing : Yes. Brad, I think you mentioned or maybe it was Neil, the razor-razorblade model for QBO. And you've used that in your Small Business segment for decades now. I'm curious, when you look at self-employed, how do you see that evolving? How do you -- where do you see opportunity to drive incremental add-ons into that self-employed base which is -- which doubled quarter-over quarter and seems to be on pace pretty quickly to get to north of a million subscribers. I'm wondering what can you sell into those users that's incremental? And how do you see that business evolving? Brad Smith : Yes. Thank you, Jesse. First of all, I would say that we don't need to sell anything else to a self-employed customer for that to be a great business. There's hundreds of millions of these prospects around the world. And as we look at that opportunity and even at our current price at roughly $10 a month to $120 a month with a low cost to acquire those customers, that is a very good and profitable business that could be substantial for the company. So with that said, we're discovering already they have additional problems to be solved that they're willing to pay us for if we solve them well. A great example is we added invoicing functionality into self-employed and that connects to payments. And the ability for us to have them actually send an invoice and get paid in a matter of 8 days versus 28 days is a real opportunity for us to have razor blade. Another example is the one we talked about earlier in the opening comments which is tax returns. The ability to have them do their self-employed, separating personal from business, management throughout the year and then come tax time, press a button and have it go into TurboTax or go to one of our accountants to do a credit return, that's also another razor blade. And we'll stay focused on other opportunities down the road, but by and large, the opportunity is getting more of these units and then solving additional problems, whether it's getting paid faster with an invoice or doing a tax return, those are the razor blades that are already emerging. And we're still on the very early innings. Jesse Hulsing : Got that. And then, a quick follow-up on international which, again, was strong and accelerated. How are you feeling about where Brazil and France are? And are you looking at launching in any other geographies with QuickBooks Online? Brad Smith : Yes. So we're proud of that momentum we're seeing. Obviously, the 3 countries that drove the bulk of that were Canada and the U.K. and Australia where we've got product market fit right coming out of the last summer and we've really been hitting the accelerator. Brazil was on track, looking good. We're feeling confident that as we head into the summer months that, that looks closer to flaking into that green light that we're looking for on product market fit. France is right on its heels and we're still in the investigator phase on how to really figure out India. The good news is there's changes in India with GST which is basically a new tax legislation that will drive more compliance. And so our teams are really rolling up their sleeves to take advantage of that. In terms of additional countries, we're leading now with QuickBooks Self-Employed. We have found that to be the fastest, lightweight, easy to get into market and solve a problem and build a base. So I just mentioned that we introduced QuickBooks Self-Employed in Singapore in the last quarter and we're going to be introducing it in Hong Kong and South Africa soon. And then, from there, we'll talk about, in the fall, whether we see other countries that we'll take QBO to. But right now, self-employed will be the point of the sphere. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Sanjit Singh : This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Just another sort of question on the tax business. If you sort of give us a sense sort of behind the scenes, as you saw the tax season progress, were there certain initiatives that you guys put in place? And if so, if we think through into next year, is this a situation where you guys have so much flexibility, given the strong franchise in tax, that you guys can sort of toggle strategies in the middle of the tax season? Brad Smith : Yes. Behind the scenes, you might imagine, is a lot of scenario planning and a lot of adjusting on the fly. It's a highly instrumented business. We're able to see, at any moment in time, how many people are in the product versus the same minute of the same day last year and then our teams are able to look at that and say, okay, do we need to adjust anything as we look ahead? We made adjustments throughout the season. I think we talked about it a little bit just on our last call. We had put some investment in advertising early in the season. And then, when we saw the delays to the tax filing, we had to go ahead and belly up to the bar and put a little more money into what we would typically think of as the trough which is after the season gets started, there's a little bit of a lull before the back half procrastinators jump in. But we advertised through the trough this year because we simply were going to have to come at some point and that paid off for us. In terms of next year, I'll say this. We don't take anything for granted. We're telling you now, we know there are things we could have done differently and better. And the neat thing about this business is we'll step back and we'll sharpen our pencils there and we'll lay out our game plan and we'll be ready for next year. And I anticipate another very competitive season next year, but I think this year demonstrates we have the ability to adjust, make the right calls and deliver the results that we're promising. So that's what we're looking forward to. Sanjit Singh : Great. And then, one quick follow-up just on mark-to-market on the Desktop business. You guys guided that's going to be down mid-single digits. Any sort of update on whether those desktop customers are making the shift to QBO? Was it still in line with what we've seen over the last couple of years? Brad Smith : Yes. It's a little bit faster, but let me give you some context. I am excited to tell you now that if customers that are coming in to the QBO franchise, QuickBooks Online, if you throw in self-employed, it's now over 90% are new to the Intuit franchise. And so that is an acceleration of even getting further category expansion and people into our business for the first time. And then, if you look at the desktop, we have, through 3 quarters now, 132,000 people who've migrated from desktop to QBO. That's up about 25% year-over-year. And so we basically done in 3 quarters what we did in 4 quarters last year, but that's not driving the bulk of this growth. 90% of these customers are new to the franchise which is exactly what we wanted. That's driving our overall active base and it's enabling us to capitalize on this TAM. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Brad, I wanted to get your perspective a little bit on the tax business. If you look this year, there wasn't as much growth in the DIY category. And I'm wondering if, going forward, you anticipate any changes or if you think this was an anomaly? Brad Smith : Yes, Kartik. I would say, first of all, we take the responsibility, as the champion of the do-it-yourself category, to grow the category. We have a 65 share. And I believe, this year, a combination of things. There was a little bit of funkiness in the overall tax season that everyone is still seeking to explain and no one yet has answers, including the IRS. So we'll have to sort through that. And then, this year, we definitely leaned our advertising and marketing more into the transform-assisted strategy which is showing people they would never be alone. And with SmartLook, you would have access to an expert. And that certainly played out well for what we wanted to do, but I'm not sure that, that succeeded in helping us expand the DIY category at large. And so we'll step back and take responsibility of what can we do to continue to accelerate that growth. What we do know is we've got secular tailwinds. And the secular tailwinds are showing that DIY is still growing faster than the assisted methods and we just have to find ways to continue to accelerate that secular trend. And we will do that as we look to next year. Kartik Mehta : And then finally, Brad, this year, we saw some aggressive competition on the DIY side from a product standpoint and what people were willing -- companies were willing to offer. Now how do you see this changing the landscape of the industry over the next couple of years? Brad Smith : Yes, Kartik, I think it will actually tie to your prior question. This is good news for the category. As you know, we've had lots of very good competition across many of our franchises over the years and every time a new competitor comes in, especially one that is well funded and they're aggressive in advertising and in pricing, that tends to accelerate the category growth because it gets more people and other masses to raise their head and get out of spreadsheets or come out of stores and say, wow, there might be a better way to do this. So I believe you saw the early days of what hopefully is going to be a continuing advertising and marketing message that says there is a much better way to get your taxes done. And if we didn't do what we know we have to do, have the best product and have the cleanest value prop, I think that's going to be good news for the category and good news for us. So I anticipate a continuation of this year's ultra-aggressive competition and I think that's a good thing for consumers and I think it's a good thing for the category. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Two quick questions. First of all, Brad, a couple of years ago, when we talked about QuickBooks Online and the QuickBooks full category, we always said there's a big, wide greenfield opportunity. 40% of guys are still doing it in Excel, et cetera, et cetera. And I'm going back to quite a few years now. How do you think, if you look at the self-employed category, are those the guys that kind of you were talking about back then? Or is this kind of like because of the change in the economy, like a whole new growing kind of way that is coming our way? That's the first question. And then one for Neil quickly. Any update on 606, with that coming obviously soon at some point? Brad Smith : Yes. Thanks, Raimo. We'll divide and conquer on this. So let me start with the first one on the number of small businesses that are still not in the accounting software category. They're using spreadsheets, shoeboxes, ink pens and checks and that number is still, believe it or not, 42%. And it is equal to not only those that are self-employed, but those that clearly could be in QuickBooks Online. In fact, in the U.S., the number of people who are ripe for QuickBooks Online are about 20 million and we have 1.8 million of them today. So there's a huge opportunity for us to show that there's a better way and that's why we're starting to lean in with more advertising and more category awareness in addition to working with accountants. So still a lot of greenfield and that represents itself, not only in the U.S., but all the countries we're going through around the globe. Let me hand it over to Neil to talk about 606. Neil Williams : Sure, Raimo. We've been working on this for quite some time. But for us, 606 won't be applicable until our fiscal year 2019 and based on what we've seen so far in our analysis, so it's really not incentive for us to adopt early. We can't really say, at this point, what the impact will be on our financial results because we haven't completed the analysis and work with our external accounting firm. But you can just remember that the desktop products we have are declining as a percentage of our total revenue and the percentage of those desktop products that involve a long term contract or long term commitment is even smaller than that. So we'll keep you posted, but just remember, for us, it's probably a fiscal year 2019 issue and we'll keep you updated as we move along. Operator : Our next question will come from Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Ross MacMillan : I had two questions, Brad. First, on tax, was there any price mix benefit this year from your traditional raising of prices as you move through the season? I wondered if that happened any earlier this season and whether that was a contributor to the price mix. And related to that, I wondered if there was any comment on non-kind of core revenues, such as audit insurance or fraud protection fees or other avenues of revenue generation that you might be starting to see. And then I have a quick follow-up. Brad Smith : Okay. Thanks, Ross. The answer to your first question is no. We really did not have any material changes in pricing or even the timing of pricing that would have affected the results the way that we're talking about here. In terms of the noncore revenue, I think is the question, we have created value bundles and we marketed those this year, bundles that include, we call them, Flots and other kinds of bundles that have things like fraud, audit defense and the ability to make sure that if anything happened, we had the ability for you to go in and keep an eye on your credit card and your credit reports. Those value-added bundles, they were ways that we were able to basically continue to help customers see value and pay for it. But there wasn't anything that jumped out that was meaningfully different than any prior year trends, to be honest with you. You said you had another question after that? Ross MacMillan : Just one for Neil or maybe Jerry. Just a clarification that when we look at the QuickBooks Online subscribers and we look at 360,000 self-employed, 433,000 international, are those mutually exclusive? Or if some of the international include self-employed and if so, do you have a sense of how much? Jerome Natoli : Yes, Ross, some of those international subs do include QuickBooks Self-Employed. We've had self-employed out there in the U.K. and in Australia now and in Canada, that we've just launched, as Brad said, a minute ago. We haven't broken out that specific number for QuickBooks Self-Employed within the 433,000 international. It's a pretty small fraction at this point, yes. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Brad, could you comment? We haven't heard a lot about fraud this year. And obviously, the -- some of the late start to the year was probably related to some IRS changes and I know you're not going to share your strategies for next year at this juncture. But what are you hearing and seeing out of the IRS for how the tax season may start next year? And then again, circling back to that fraud discussion and what you saw year-over-year, just as an industry perspective. Brad Smith : Yes, Scott, I would say what we saw was incredibly encouraging. The industry once again locked arms, not only the do-it-yourself industry, the professional tax preparers and the banking industry as well as the IRS in the federal and then the state level too. And I think we all feel like we continue to push the ball forward in terms of getting the bad guys out of the system. We won't know the dimensions of how much we were able to do until the IRS comes out and reports that out in late summer, early fall.  But everyone of us collectively believe that we continue to advance the cause and we're going to stay at this. It's going to be a multiyear ongoing effort until we get every cybercriminal out of the system that we can. So that's sort of bucket 1. Now what are the impacts to next year? There are a lot of things this season that everyone's still processing, things that we ended up requiring tax filers to do. Next year, we hope to be able to do with less friction and one of them was the one that Neil mentioned in his opening comments which is in an effort to try to ensure we got cybercriminals out, if you did not know your prior year adjusted gross income or you didn't know you tax filing PIN, then you were able to process your return using our software, but then you had to print it out and mail it. You could not e-file it without those 2 pieces of information. And that ended up, in our case, with about 500,000 people who were able to do their taxes in TurboTax but had to put it in an envelope and send it into the IRS. So I think next year, industry and the IRS in the States will say is that the experience we want to continue or is there something we can do that's just as equally protective but less friction for the taxpayer. But right now, it's too early to know what those are. We'll work those over the summer and talk to you about them in the fall when we do our Investor Day. Scott Schneeberger : All right. And then just following up, Neil and you may have already covered it in your discussion of return of capital, but year-to-date, a little bit lighter than would have been expected, I think, on share repurchases. I realize there were some debt reduction going on in this recent quarter. But is there any -- yes, well, in response to share count for the full year, any change to that outlook or any catch-up anticipated back to prior year levels? And you may not want to address this year because it's near term, but how should we think about share repurchase going out on a run rate a few years out? Neil Williams : Yes, Scott, I would tell you that I think Q3 is a bit of an anomaly. As you mentioned, we did have those senior notes that were due in March. And so we had some cash we allocated to debt reduction. And frankly, the matrix we had in our 10b5 also was a little more conservative at higher stock prices. So we didn't buy as many shares and at some of the higher price points at times, during the quarter, when we had to be out in the market for other reasons. So our stock repurchase plan has worked really great for us and so I would view Q3 being more of an anomaly than a trend going forward. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Brad, I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned that there was about 11% contribution from TurboTax on the QBO business. And I was wondering if you could just sort of comment on was that about as expected. Was it better than you thought? I'm just trying to get a sense on, yes, you guys obviously were expecting some contribution from TurboTax to QBO. Did that outperform and I guess if there was any specific reason why when you look back at the strength in the quarter in QBO subs? Brad Smith : Yes. Thanks, Kirk. So you're referring to the 11 points of QuickBooks Online growth that we got from TurboTax Self-Employed, sending customers over. That was healthy. We had aspirations that we thought would be very positive. I've got to tell you that we were delighted and surprised that we saw the strength in the TurboTax channel feeding QuickBooks Self-Employed which gives us even more reason to lean in more aggressively next year. And so I would say that we did not have 11 points modeled in, at the same time, we'll take it and we're going to say how do we blow on that ember and turn it into a raging fire as we look at next year. Kirk Materne : And if I could ask just one quick follow-up. I assume, when you're getting benefits from the TurboTax channel, that tends to be more disproportionate in the U.S. -- on the U.S. QBO business than on the international, just based on sort of where your channel space is right now. Is that fair? Brad Smith : It is. We have TurboTax in the U.S. and Canada. So we'll have the ability to pass into that channel that way. But we're also working with QuickBooks Self-Employed in all the other countries to say it doesn't have to go to an Intuit tax product, they can see it in accountants. And as a result, accountants will recommend QuickBooks Self-Employed to get more tax customers. So think about this being a strategy that works everywhere. It just may not go into TurboTax like it does in the U.S. and Canada. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. James MacDonald : Just following up on Scott's question on fraud. Do you think that affected the unit growth in the market as a whole and maybe will affect unit growth in future years? Brad Smith : Yes, Jim, I really wish I knew the explanation on the unit growth at the IRS level. We can go back to 2013, where the industry really lined up and everyone got aggressive and we were all trying to get security beefed up and kind of get cybercriminals out. And in 2014, we actually saw the IRS return to grow over 1%. So even though we took a big bite of the apple then, it didn't slow down total tax returns. Now we continue to get better and better each year. So I really can't tell you and we're trying to hesitate to put out other hypotheses because I probably heard a half a dozen myself just having conversations. I think we'll have to wait and see what the IRS comes out with and then we'll be able to compare their data with ours and we will be as transparent as possible at Investor Day of what we think ultimately led to this very unusual tax filing season with the IRS. James MacDonald : Okay. Great. And just a quick follow-up. You haven't given a number, but is it proper math to say if you grew TurboTax units -- revenue 9% and units 2%, that the price mix impact was 7%? Or is that incorrect math? Brad Smith : You know what, that math works for me. Coming from where I come from, that's exactly the way we calculated it too. James MacDonald : Okay. Just trying to figure out if units had a bigger impact in some way, shape or form. Brad Smith : No, you actually got it. We looked at -- we actually broke it down and looked at the revenue per return and it's roughly 7% as well. And it was driven by that 60-20-20 mix I mentioned a little while ago. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman : Well, just quickly following up on your -- on the last question. To what extent did the 500,000 returns that didn't get counted as do-it-yourself get counted however in tax, in your tax revenue? And then I have several more. Brad Smith : Yes, Michael. So let me take this one then and then we'll get back to your other ones. That 500,000, they ended up processing using our product and paying that. So that's in that revenue per return. But then when they showed up at the IRS, the IRS counted them as paper because they showed up in an envelope and not coming through on e-file. So if you had to throw those 500,000 back into the mix which is why you heard Neil say that those don't show up in the IRS category growth numbers and they don't show up in our share counts because we always compare our stuff against the IRS. But there's 500,000 that we did get paid for, so that shows up in our revenue, but it doesn't necessarily show up when the IRS prints its numbers and says, whoa, paper grew for the first time in a few years while it was because people processed with software and then had to mail it in because they didn't know their PIN. Michael Millman : Okay. So it would suggest that the 7% that you just talked about, increase in price, really, that doesn't particularly jive with what you just said about increased number of returns... Brad Smith : I'm sorry, yes. We're not tracking the same way. Go ahead, Neil. Neil Williams : The 500,000, Michael, are in our unit number that we disclosed that we said was up 2%. Michael Millman : Oh, so they are in your numbers. Neil Williams : They're in our unit numbers... Brad Smith : Yes, we're talking two different things here, Michael. I'm sorry, we're talking units which we said were up 2%. E-files which are ultimately the IRS when you receive those and then they count those as were those paper or software, that's where the numbers get a little bit out of sorts. But our numbers are 2% unit growth, 9% year-to-date revenue growth and the average revenue per unit went up about 7% and that was the math that Jim was just asking about a few minutes ago as well. Michael Millman : Okay. So it does seem, when you look at your numbers down from up 15% to 2%, the IRS 5 7 down to kind of 0.2, that it was a bigger -- you had a bigger effect than the IRS and leads to sort of the next question, is that you indicated that you were affected at the low end or the free end. And so I kind of wonder, to what extent that, that was blocked doing many more free but also increasing but free, covered, would seem to hurt your potential complexity. I was kind of also interested in the effect of Comer which a lot of people talked about, but maybe you can give us some numbers on it. And then the other side of the coin is TaxACT going the other way. And we see that as having some impact on the industry. Brad Smith : Okay, Michael. So let me try to parse that and I'll say that I think it was the collective competitive environment with all the names that you mentioned, including us, that led to a little more of an even distribution of who got the free, free customers. And over the last several years, we were out there pretty much alone with the Absolute Zero program. And this year, everyone dove in and decided they wanted a piece of that pie. Now it happened to coincide with the fact that after 3 years of that being our main message, we chose to pivot our broadcast, our TV advertising to more SmartLook which was the assisted -- transform assisted. So we sort of went dark in terms of broadcast media. On the free message, we still had that in digital. And they all came out with TV ads. And so I think that's why we allowed ourselves to kind of let some of this free, free customers to go elsewhere. And suffice it to say, regardless of whether it was the competitors you named or others, we don't plan to play the game the same way next year. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Colville with Arete Research. Patrick Colville : Can you help me understand the acceleration in self-employed? So I mean, judging by the other questions asked in the call, it's clear that was just an inflection in growth in the U.S. So what was the cause of that inflection? Brad Smith : Yes, so Patrick, it's a combination of things. First of all, there's just a secular trend of the gig economy. It's now estimated to be about 34% of the workforce and expected to be 43% by the year 2020. And these individuals have complexity to have to separate their personal business expense and then in the case of the United States, they have to follow Schedule C. And so ultimately, when you put that together, you say there's a lot more of them. We've been signing partnerships with Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, DoorDash, you name it, we've got all kinds of partnerships out there. And we've been working aggressively with the accountant channel because for the accountants, these are some of the hardest customers to serve because they don't have their steps sorted out, they come in at tax time and it's really laborious for the accountant to get the stuff all separated. So the accountants and the partnerships have been driving it. And then the second thing is we have 60 million people who come to QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks.com every year. That is a huge funnel. And now by introducing this as one of the product lineup SKUs, we're able to capitalize on our own web traffic and convert those into customers. The last piece I would say is 2 parts. One is new channels and one was TurboTax.com which added 160,000 QuickBooks Self-Employed units in the last quarter. And the other was new geographies, where we just introduced it in Singapore and we'll be opening up to other countries as well. So I'll put a bow around it and say, secular trends, we have channels with accountants and our own web marketing and partnerships like with Uber that are growing the core business. You add to that the opportunity to go with TurboTax as a channel and then open new geographies and we think self-employed has a lot of opportunity for growth as we look ahead. Patrick Colville : Got it. And can I just quickly follow up. So do you think this, the self-employed, is expanding the category? Or is there some, a small amount of cannibalization at the low end of kind of the desktop products? Brad Smith : I am so happy you asked that question. I have been dying to share this data. I had truly been waiting. I was even going to add it to my closing comments if no one asked. So over the last several quarters, actually, for the last couple of years, we've been talking about what percent of customers are new to the franchise coming into QuickBooks and then what percent of new customers are choosing an online version versus desktop. We used to say 80% of all the customers coming into QBO were new to the franchise. Well, now with self-employed, it moved above 90%. The other thing is, now when you have a customer going to our website and saying, do I want the desktop version or online, we now have over 80% of them choosing an online version of the product, whether it's self-employed or QBO. That was 70% just a quarter ago and it was just in the 60s 12 months ago. So this is expanding the category. And what's that mean? If you count the number of customers who bought one of our products and paid for it in the last 12 months, that total paying customer base is up 40% and that's up from 34% just 90 days ago. So it is expanding the category with some pretty exciting opportunities ahead of us. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Yun Kim with Benchmark. Yun Kim : Can you just talk about what are -- what you are thinking about the overall ASP headwind that you are obviously experiencing in some level as your self-employed mix becomes larger and larger? If I did my math right, I think about half of the new QBO subs -- sub-adds in the quarter was given by self-employed. Obviously, given the opportunity to aggressively add new QBO subs, especially around self-employed subs, what are some of the parameters and metrics that you are monitoring or using to ensure some cost discipline around the QBO acquisition cost? Brad Smith : Sure, thank you. First of all, I would say, this is why we've tried to articulate the 2 things that we measure inside and we talk about in our operating reviews and with our board and it is growing the subscriber base north of 40% and growing the total online ecosystem revenue 25% to 30%. And we just posted 59% on the first number and we just posted the second consecutive quarter of online ecosystem revenue growing at 30%. So it's the high end of that 25% to 30%. The second point I would say is, our emphasis right now is razors, not blades. Whether it's self-employed going after the hundreds of millions around the world at the point of the spear or it's QuickBooks Online, where we're trying to continue to accelerate and get new customers into the franchise and out of spreadsheets, that is our absolute top priority.  And as you can see, that is driving online ecosystem revenue growth, where we're at the high end of the range at 30% 2 quarters in a row. In terms of the discipline, Neil referred to this a few minutes ago when we were asked about the margins continuing to expand even while we're in a pretty heavy investment mode to expanding to new countries. And that's because we watch LTV to CAC, the lifetime value divided by the cost to acquire a customer. And every country has a target and as you know, we've collectively been driving our LTV to CAC. If you look at QBO across the globe, it's around 5.5. 5.5. And if you throw in desktop, it's about 6.9. So we're maintaining that discipline. But we're focused on the razors, whether it's self-employed or it's QBO. We'ren't worried about whether one is $10 a month or one is $24 a month because we focus on LTV to CAC to make sure we have the right discipline and cost to acquire and that's driving overall revenue growth and margin expansion. Yun Kim : Okay. Great. Real quick on the tax business. It's just a quick fundamental question, Brad. Are you still committed to going after the new taxpayers coming into the market, even if this means that there could be some incremental margin headwind to get those customers given the increasing competition for those customers? Brad Smith : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith : Sure, Brian, I'll keep it short. Well, we want to thank everybody for the questions today. Obviously, we're feeling good with the quarter. More importantly, we feel like we have momentum that we're building as we enter the fourth quarter and we have some important lessons learned that will sharpen our thinking as we look ahead to next year. So looking forward to catching up with you soon. And with that, thanks for the time this afternoon. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference.",

My name is Latif and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Intuit's Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Mr. Natoli? Jerome Natoli : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's fourth quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. I'm here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO; and Neil Williams, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2016, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brad. Brad Smith : Alright, thanks Jerry and thanks to all of you for joining us. As you read in our press release today we've announced a CFO succession plan. Neil has served a CFO since January 2008 and plans to step down at the end of January 2018. I'm pleased to share that Michelle Clatterbuck will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer on February 1, 2018. It has been a well crafted succession plan that we will cover in a few minutes but let's start with the business. We had an excellent fourth quarter and a strong finish to fiscal year 2017. Fourth quarter revenue grew 12% and full year revenue grew 10%. We're encouraged by the accelerating momentum in small business including a continued strength in both our QuickBooks Online subscribers and online ecosystem revenue growth. We're also pleased with our results in both consumer and professional tax which delivered at the high end of our expectations in a complicated tax season. Across the company we continue to innovate and improve our product experiences to deliver meaningful benefit for our customers. For example we improved end-to-end experience for QBO customers which resulted in a 22 point increase in our Net Promoter Score. We solved important pain points for self-employed business operators such as the ability to separate personal and business expenses, send invoices and receive payments, and track their mileage. This led to a quadrupling of our QuickBooks self-employed customer base. We expanded our SmartLook video chat capability to help our TurboTax Online customers answer that one nagging question that could cause them to abandon the product. Customers who use SmartLook rated their care experience nearly 20 points higher than those who did not. Our One Intuit Ecosystem has evolved into an active ecosystem, creating greater value for our customers while building new sources of competitive advantage for Intuit. Let me share just a couple of examples. First of all our new QBO matchmaking platform is connecting small businesses with the right accountant. We know that 89% of small businesses believe they're more successful when they work with an accountant and this year 53% of our small business customers are now doing so. That is a 10 point increase versus last year. This has the potential to be a key driver of small business success and a catalyst for Intuit\u2019s growth over the long-term. Second, we're helping accountants grow their practices delivering three times more client leads than we did just one year ago. Third, our TurboTax and QuickBooks self-employed bundle is putting more money in our self-employed customers pockets eliminating work and making it drop dead simple to track and deduct business expense. As a result we're generating more than $4300 in tax savings for self-employed customers which is 8% of their income on average. We'll share more about our plans to further strengthen and accelerate our One Intuit Ecosystem at our upcoming Investor Day in October. But now let\u2019s talk about our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results and we'll start with small business. We delivered another strong year with subscriber growth continuing at a rapid pace and online ecosystem revenue accelerating. We added over 870,000 QuickBooks Online customers in fiscal 2017, that's twice as many as we added in fiscal 2016. We finished the year with over 2.3 million customers driving subscriber growth to 58% up from 41% last year. We continue to deliver strong QBO growth in the U.S. and international markets. Our U.S. subscriber base grew 53% year-over-year to nearly 1.9 million subs up from 40% growth last year. Outside the U.S. our subscriber base grew 75% year-over-year to over 500,000 subs up from 45% growth last year. We've also seen our Net Promoter Scores improve in every country year-over-year giving us confidence that our international growth formula is working. As a reminder our playbook when entering a new market is to focus on product market fit first, then we lean heavily into marketing to drive subscriber growth. We continue to feel good about our position in Canada, the UK, and Australia surpassing the 100,000 subscriber mark in all three countries this year. Our teams in France, Brazil and India are working hard to reach product market fit in their respective countries. We will share more on our progress in the coming quarters. Within QuickBooks Online self-employed subscribers grew to approximately 390,000 that is up from 360,000 last quarter and 85,000 just one year ago. Our bundled self-employed offering in TurboTax contributed approximately 170,000 subscribers to this total. Summing it up our momentum in QBO subscriber growth continues to drive top line revenue with online ecosystem revenue growth accelerating to 33% that is up from 30% last quarter. We expect subscriber growth to continue north of 40% and we now expect online ecosystem revenue to grow more than 30% over the next few years. That is up from our previous guidance of 25% to 30%. Turning to tax, consumer tax revenue finished the year up 9% in a complex season that was defined by below normal IRS returns growth and a highly competitive environment in the free category. We performed well with our paid customers driving our revenue growth this season. Our team is already hard at work reimagining our tax business and building the next wave of innovation to better serve our customers in both the free and the paid segments. There is no question there is still a ton of opportunity in this business especially as we leverage technology to provide even more value to our customers. We are very excited as we look ahead to next season and we'll share more with you when we see you at Investor Day. On the ProConnect side revenue also finished the year at the top end of our guidance range. We continue to focus on multiservice accounting firms that do both books and taxes. This is in service to driving our accountants customer success and growing our small business ecosystem.  Taking up the nose of the plane, let me share some context for where we're headed as a company. Over the past nine months our senior leadership team has invested significant time completing an extensive outside in, future back exploration to set the foundation for our next chapter of growth. The end result is the most comprehensive collection of market and customer insights we have ever amassed. And this has led to a complete refresh of our company's game plan to win from the company's mission all the way down to the metrics.  Our One Intuit Ecosystem strategy as we're calling it will power the next chapter of growth. It capitalizes on our tens of millions of active customers and a vast amount of data that we steward on their behalf. When you match that data with our leading technology and our machine learning capabilities we are able to deliver deeply personalized experiences through a trusted open platform and create indispensable connections not only between people but between products and we can do it in a way that is not easily matched by our rivals. As new participants enter this Intuit Ecosystem, the value increases for everyone unleashing the power of many for the prosperity of one. In support of our refreshed strategy we have made some deliberate decisions to target investments in several key areas during fiscal 2018. You will hear more about these investments from Neil in a minute. We expect these initiatives to further accelerate our long-term revenue growth. So with that said, let me hand it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details. Neil Williams : Thanks Brad and good afternoon everyone. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we delivered revenue of $842 million up 12% year-over-year. Our GAAP operating loss of $10 million versus a $56 million loss a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income of $78 million versus 36 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.09 versus a loss of $0.16 last year. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.20 up from $0.08 last year. You'll note that our GAAP earnings per share includes a tax impact of early adoption of the accounting standard update for share based compensation. This added $0.13 to our GAAP earnings for the quarter and $0.28 for the full year. For full fiscal 2017 we delivered revenue of 5.2 billion up 10% year-over-year, GAAP operating income of 1.4 billion up 12% versus a year ago, non-GAAP operating income of 1.7 billion also up 12% versus last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share $3.72 versus $3.69 last year. As a reminder our GAAP results in fiscal 2016 included a net gain of $0.65 per share from the sale of discontinued operations. And our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.41 up from $3.78 last year for an increase of 17%. Turning to the business segments, total small business revenue grew 14% for the quarter and 13% for the year. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth remains strong and we exceeded our guidance for the quarter and the full year reaching 2,383,000 subscribers up 58% year-over-year. TurboTax was a significant challenge for QuickBooks self-employed for the year accounting for 11 points of QBO subscriber growth, a great example of the power of the One Intuit Ecosystem that Brad just mentioned. Small business online ecosystem revenue accelerated to 33% in the fourth quarter and grew 30% for the year. This is above the high end of the 25% to 30% growth range we\u2019ve talked about and is driven by continued growth of online accounting revenue. Our online payroll and payments businesses remain healthy growing revenue 21% and 12% for the year respectively. As Brad mentioned our outlook over the next few years calls for over 40% growth in QBO subs, we expect online ecosystem revenue to grow better than 30%, and our subscriber growth is on top of the 58% increase we've posted in fiscal 2017 demonstrating the confidence we have in our strategy. Our small business desktop ecosystem total revenue grew 8% for the year despite desktop units being down 8%. For fiscal 2018 we expect QuickBooks desktop units to decline low double-digits and desktop ecosystem revenue to be up mid single-digits. That revenue growth is driven by continued strength in our QuickBooks enterprise business. Consumer tax revenue was up 9% for the year reflecting two points of unit growth and ProConnect revenue grew 2% for the year. Turning to our financial principles, we continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management. With approximately $800 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. Our goal is to drive double-digit revenue growth and grow operating income faster than revenue. We return cash that we can invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased over $360 million of shares in the fourth quarter and over $830 million for the year. Approximately $1.5 billion remains on our authorization. We returned approximately 85% of our free cash flow to shareholders last year and more than 100% over the last five years. That level is not sustainable so you'll notice the share count guidance for FY18 reflects a slightly more moderate buyback program than in recent years. We expect to be in the market each quarter and will continue to keep an eye on investment alternatives and overall market conditions as we manage our program. In fiscal 2018 we expect to pay a cash dividend of $1.56 per share with the first dividend of $0.39 per share payable on October 18, 2017. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.  As Brad mentioned we're reallocating over 10% of our annual spend to strengthen our investment in several key priorities over the next three years including increasing our capability in artificial intelligence and machine learning, accelerating our transition to Amazon Web Services, enhancing our brand and marketing effectiveness globally, and enabling our engineering organization to increase effectiveness and efficiency. We expect these initiatives to set us up to deliver strong growth in the coming years. Even with these investments we expect our operating margin to expand modestly in fiscal 2018. Our full year fiscal 2018 guidance includes QBO subscribers of 3.275 million to 3.375 million, total company revenue growth of 9% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $4 to $4.10 per share, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.90 to $5. Our Q1 fiscal 2018 guidance included revenue growth of 8% to 11%, a GAAP loss per share of $0.17 to $0.19, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.03 to $0.05. You can find our Q1 and fiscal 2018 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. We are making a few changes to our segment reporting in fiscal 2018. Our principle is to align our segments with our core customers and business partners. We're creating a consumer segment by combining our consumer ecosystem offering which includes our Mint business with the Consumer Tax segment. We are renaming the Small Business segment as Small Business & Self-Employed and renaming ProConnect as the Strategic Partner segment. This segment will manage our professional tax offerings while also focusing on partners instrumental to the success of our ecosystem. All these changes are reflected on our factsheet. On a personal note over the last several years it has been a priority for me and my team to think about our long-term strategy and that includes finding and nurturing awesome talent. As we announced today, I'll be stepping down in January. I'm really confident in Michelle. She thinks and acts like a Chief Operating Officer and demonstrates a unique blend of partnering and influencing skills that are backed by deep domain expertise. She brings credibility as a strategic thinker who connects dots that others often don't see. I look forward to working with her over the next five months to ensure a smooth transition. And with that I'll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith : Thank you, Neil. I know our CFO transition isn\u2019t official until February but I wanted to take this moment to express my sincere admiration and appreciation for all that you've contributed over the past decade. Our financial foundation has never been stronger. We successfully navigated a business model transition, we're posting double-digit revenue growth, expanding margins and we have a strong investment grade rating. Your commitment to recruiting and developing top talent has created a deep bench of strong financial leaders which makes a seamless transition of our leadership team possible. And Michelle she has risen to every occasion at every step along the journey, consistently delivering outstanding performance across multiple strategic leadership roles and multiple business units over the past 14 years. We're excited to have her succeed you as our next CFO in February. So with that said let me bring our introductory comments to a close. It's another strong year in the books for Intuit reflecting increasing momentum in our QuickBooks Online ecosystem and strength in our tax businesses. I am proud of the innovations that our team continued to deliver every day. We are looking forward to sharing more with you in October. And with that we will open it up to you to hear what's on your mind. Latif. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Nemeroff : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a strong year and nice job on the quarter. And Neil it has been a pleasure working with you, congrats on the retirement. Brad if I may, just on the small business side, it looks like the TurboTax SE promotion was highly successful in this tax season actually last quarter as well. I was wondering if you could maybe tell us about some of the other cross promotional activity that you plan going forward and then also if you could maybe tell us if there's any noticeable difference in the retention of the TurboTax SE versus the standalone SE subscribers so far? Brad Smith : Thank you, Michael. Let me start by saying this was an incredibly inspiring year to see the power of our ecosystem. It is not just connecting products like QuickBooks self-employed and TurboTax self-employed but it's connecting people. I gave the example of the power of connecting a small business with an accountant and now accountants are getting three times as many leads as they did last year and we have small businesses increasing their odds of success and they're working with accountants more often. So that\u2019s the power of bringing people together.  On the self-employed side we've had a very good the one year, when I say a version one year 170,000 active subscribers but we know in the TurboTax base there are roughly 3 million of our filers who have Schedule C filing and they are self-employed customers. So we have a lot of upside opportunity there to continue to accelerate the growth. We also had success last year in connecting our credit score in Mint with TurboTax to begin to move beyond just the tax filing needs of a consumer and begin to think about their entire financial life. That's why we are moving these two businesses together and having one consumer backed business unit now that Neil just mentioned. That was a great example. And then we have the matchmaking platform. What we basically did was take QuickBooks Online for accountants, we added some practice management capabilities, and we've enabled the ability now for a small business looking for an accountant to be connected with one that actually meets their needs. And those were just a few examples. We had many more and we plan to showcase those at our October Investor Day. But we're excited to see this ecosystem really starting to create value for multiple parties. Michael Nemeroff : Thanks for taking my questions, appreciate it. Brad Smith : Welcome. Operator : Thank you and next question comes from Kash Rangan of Bank of America. Your question please. Kash Rangan : Sure, Neil are you sure you want to miss the tax rush of April 2017 and not being around for the 11th year to watch the units? Neil Williams : You know Kash its going to be a big miss but I\u2019ll do my best to get through it. Kash Rangan : That was a facetious question. Well congratulations, it's been great working with you over past 10 years. Brad, sorry you get the serious question. It's really impressive to see the QBO SE business take a dimension of its own. What's your best guess/prediction as to how this installed base of customers QBO SE behaves differently than the typical QBO customer, in another words say you've had a legacy set of systems that QBO typical QBO customers desktop customers have been tethered to, do you think this new customer base has a completely different demographic, different business profile and therefore are there other ways in which Intuit could monetize this exciting new dimension of the business by adding other value added services and products that you previously had not envisioned in your typical QBO customer base as far as their behavior is concerned? Thank you so much my only question. Brad Smith : Thank you, Kash, and I think I'd rather answer Neil\u2019s question. I\u2019ll take that one and by the way it gives me a chance to double back to Michael what it means to leave off a piece of Michaels question which was do we see any sort of behaviors and retention around QuickBooks self-employed, TurboTax self-employed. And the answer is we're still in the early phases of that but its performing exactly as we had hoped and actually slightly more positive. So we\u2019ll talk more about that at Investor Day Michael and I am sorry I didn\u2019t close that out. Kash to your point, I've got to tell you self-employed is one of the more exciting things I\u2019ve seen in my 15 years here. We talk about a TAM of 800 million small businesses around the world, 750 million of those qualify as self-employed or businesses of One.  Today this is about 34% of the workforce around the globe. It's going to be 43% in the next handful of years and it's a very real phenomenon. And what makes it exciting in terms of their behaviors and some of the differences that you asked me about, it is not just the numbers it's their needs. When you get underneath what keeps a self-employed business operator awake at night the first is the fluctuation of income. It is feast or famine. They may have lots of rides in Uber and then a period of time where there are no rides or if they're working for Taskrabbit or DoorDash, lots of deliveries and then not a lot of deliveries and they have to find a way to kind of even out that cash flow so that they have the ability to cover their necessities and live a daily life. The other thing is finding the next gig. They often work two or three of these different jobs. So, sometimes they drive and sometimes they deliver and sometimes they'll actually do tasks. And so we're bringing a combination of matchmaking capabilities, the ability for you to separate your personal and business expense, the ability for you to predict your income and then what you're going to need to have for a certain bill, and we're trying to help them manage their lives that way. So there are a lots of unique things that we have assets that we can apply in different ways that we think will help solve the most important problems. I love where you finished your question which is other services we could sell. We got used to razor and razorblade in QBO. That model also applies to self-employed but in different products. It's not going to be payroll and payment but it could be TurboTax, the ability to manage your finances and then connect to taxes which is what we proved this year.  We have added payments capability, the ability to send an invoice, track it like a Domino's pizza, and then get paid electronically through your mobile phone. So we have additional services but I would say this, ARPC for us isn\u2019t the primary focus in self-employed. It is getting all 750 million even if it's $10 a month that is a beautiful business and we're super excited about the self-employed opportunity. So I hope I have covered all your aspects and Michael I don\u2019t know if I will get jail free on the one I went back and answered for you. Kash Rangan : Great job Brad, congrats Neil, we'll miss you. Thanks so much. Brad Smith : Thanks Kash. Don't make me start missing him right now. He has got five months left. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your question please. Walter Pritchard : Thanks, I'm wondering just on tax if you could help us understand, I think units have been the focus of your growth and units were a little disappointing in fiscal 2017 and you've come back with a pretty strong tax guide for fiscal 2018. I am wondering if you could -- I know you give us a lot of detail generally on Analyst Day but I am wondering if you can give us any sort of early glimpses to how you think that 7% to 9% comes together as you look into 2018? Brad Smith : Sure Walter, let me start first with our guiding principle remains we want to expand the category, grow the number of people using our services which were customers, and then look for ways to translate that into revenue and profit growth. And those are our priorities. And at the end of the day this year we didn't see that play out. We saw customer growth being a little more tepid at 2% but we did get strong monetization and we are able to deliver above the guidance we had provided.  I'm proud of the team. I think we left this year encouraged by two things, the way we were able to still achieve our financial results and also some lessons learned in terms of how we can accelerate both category and customer growth as we look ahead. As you know it's a hypercompetitive tax category so I don't want to unveil too much now. We will talk a little bit more about it when we get closer to tax season but I will give you three major buckets which we did talk about last year. One is the ability to continue to accelerate do it yourself category and compete more effectively in the free segment. The second is the opportunity to begin to transform the assisted tax category bringing the best of technology with human assistance together through our SmartLook capabilities. And the third is to begin to expand beyond tax and solve additional financial problems that these consumers are wrestling with and an example last year was credit score and now with Mint and other assets combined we see those as opportunities and catalysts for growth as well. That's what gave us the confidence to be able to give you the outlook of 7% to 9% growth which is an acceleration from this past season. Walter Pritchard : And then Neil just on the expense front, it sounds like you were almost calling out some investments that you would make this year that were kind of unusual or ones that you needed to make. Is that the case or how should we think about the level of incremental OPEX that you're guiding for in 2018 versus how you would kind of steady state run the business? Neil Williams : You know Walter the four areas that I called out and mentioned are all things that came out of the strategic reassessment that Brad mentioned at the beginning of the call. As we begin to plan really for the next few years we've felt like we really needed to put more investment and more focus and more attention around artificial intelligence, machine learning, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our engineering investment which as you know is a considerable investment, accelerating our transition to AWS, and then also improving the effectiveness of our marketing in the U.S. and around the world. So those are all areas we felt like we're -- maybe we had been under investing in the past and so there's a very diligent effort for 2018 and really going forward to step up in those areas with clear benefits delineated problem around the product offering and around customer benefits. So yes, that was a big focus of our plan for 2018 and really going forward. Walter Pritchard : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh : Hi, this is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. I guess first to start off on Neil, sad to see you go. It's been a pleasure working with you but best of luck in retirement. In terms of questions to start off I just had a quick clarification on the tax guidance. Embedded in your tax guidance, to what extent are you looking at an improvement in terms of overall filing growth, I understand that it was little bit of a weird year in terms of overall tax filing growth, are you assuming a sort of return to normal fee going into next year? Brad Smith : Yes, this is Brad. First of all it was an unusual year this year and we'll have to wait till October to see where it ultimately finishes up. What we are seeing across the industry is a little bit of an uptick in extension filing so whether this year ends at being flat or slightly up it is still more like 2013 and not like a typical cycle. So right now in our plan to answer your question specifically, we're in that 0% to 1% range. That is sort of where we are. Now sometimes the industry is a little more bullish than that and they'll say it's 1% to 1.5% or 1% to 2% but we're in the 0% to 1% that's what we factored in and that\u2019s the model that we're using for the guidance we just gave. Sanjit Singh : Got it and then just a follow-up on margins both short-term looking at next year and then maybe a little bit longer-term. When we look at margins expanding slightly next year what are sort of the main factors that are driving -- what are the opportunities for you guys to drive margins next year? And then longer term with this QuickBooks self-employed emerging as a massive opportunity when we think about margins longer-term, how does that fit into your overall long-term margin framework? Neil Williams : I'll take this one. Just a reminder, our first priority is always to grow our customer base and our top line revenue. So that's our first financial principle and always a thing we think about first. We're excited and we're encouraged by the growth we saw in 2017 and some prospects we see going forward. And that's really encouraged us to lean in and to invest more, to fund and accelerate some of this growth. And I think our ability to do that, the ability to put money into the areas I just mentioned in a more concentrated way and still deliver some margin expansion for 2018 is just a tremendous thing and it shows our commitment to our second financial principle of growing our operating income faster than our top line revenue. And is also indicative of just really a very intense focus inside the company to concentrate our investments in areas we think are really going to drive growth long-term. How the margins play out in future years will really just be determined on the investment opportunities that we see at the time. So I really can't comment on that. But I'm really delighted with where we ended up in the margin guidance for 2018 to drive the type of investment that we're seeing in top line growth and still deliver some good margin expansion I think as I\u2019m pleased with that. Sanjit Singh : Understood and congrats on a nice fiscal year. Brad Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thank you very much and my congrats and Neil you\u2019ll be missed but looking forward to see you at the Analyst Day in a month or so. Neil Williams : Thanks. Ross MacMillan : Just on the consumer tax outlook Brad, I just had a couple of questions. You outlined three things that made your buckets if you will that you think can drive the growth and I had two specific questions. One is on the acquisition of -- or condition of assisted, are we getting to a point now where SmartLook is actually driving sort of more users to TurboTax and if so do they tend to be higher value users in the sense that they're not 1040 filers that tend to come from assisted. So they're already sort of higher value, that's question one? And then question two is when we think about additional services, I think you talked about 20% of the ARPU uplift this year came from things like fraud protection or audit insurance, is that an expanding part of the pie, is that going to continue to drive an incrementally higher amount of growth in consumer tax? Thanks a lot. Brad Smith : Yes, thank you Ross. Let me start first with the transform assisted. As you know about 40% of the market uses a DIY service and 60% roughly an assisted, if you throw stores and CPA's in there together. And then if you look at where the dollars are spent, it is disproportionately much more towards assisted. So there is a big value pool there and a lot of them we believe could be using a do it yourself solution and they simply have this nagging question that we have found SmartLook solve delightfully well and we're able to get them into the DIY category.  So what we did see this year with SmartLook were three things; one is the sources of new customers this year did come at a higher percentage from those who have been using an assisted method last year. So yes, we are getting people into the DIY category with the SmartLook offerings. Number two is when they use it they were delighted. They had a 20 point higher customer satisfaction rating than those who did not use which we believe will translate into the third lever which is fewer people who have a nagging question in the future will think they have to leave a do it yourself solution and go to assistance. We think it will help with retention.  So we think the transform assisted is early days but we've seen enough proof points to say this is something that we're going to lean into aggressively and we had a really good year this year with it. The second on the value added services, we do recognize that customers pay for value and while some portions of the tax market are free and we certainly have led that way for many, many years we do discover if we solve additional problems for customers they're willing to pay for those services. You came out with a couple of them in your question and we are exploring others. That's why we put the Mint business and the TurboTax business together to begin to think more holistically about the overall financial needs of a consumer. I don't want to go much more into detail there but the answer to your question is yes, you can imagine portions of this value prop will start to get -- they will be more free and then there will be more other areas where we will be able to monetize and that's why we continue to look at strong growth in both customers as well as revenue. Ross MacMillan : That's helpful, thank you. And then one follow up just quickly on the investments in fiscal 2018, there was four buckets there that Neil mentioned. I just wondered on enhanced branding and marketing, to what extent you're going to lean into acquiring more free users in TurboTax or look to sort of up the ante on absolute zero or whatever marketing plan you have for the forthcoming year? Brad Smith : Yeah, I would say two things; one is that enhanced brand and marketing will be across the ecosystem. So we have services from QuickBooks Online to self-employed to global markets we're opening up to obviously TurboTax. So think about that as an aggregate bucket because we've learned if we get one growing we can accelerate the growth of the other. I want to hold off if you don't mind on revealing too much about what we plan to do or not do with absolutely zero at this point given the competitive nature of the market. But suffice it to say that just as we always do, we came out with some lessons learned and we're excited to get back in the game next year. So we'll share a little bit more closer to season. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much and congrats again. Brad Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nandan Amladi of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nandan Amladi : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Neil congrats on your retirement, I hope to see you next in a few weeks at Analyst Day. Brad the question on the sustained 40% unit growth for QuickBooks Online, how much growth are you expecting in the self-employed and international as part of the 40%? Brad Smith : Yeah Nandan, that will be a key piece of it. We still see lots of upside in the U.S. We have a good significant number of small businesses here that are still using Excel spreadsheets and Shoeboxes and so that will be core growth in the U.S. whether it's in the self-employed segment or what we historically thought of as core QBO. Quarter we now see that as a QBO line-up just like we have TurboTax, basic, deluxe and premier we're going to have the same thing here with QBO. And as we open up new markets we've got real acceleration happening in the UK, Canada, and Australia. We're still in the final stages of getting product market fit in India, France, and Brazil and so those will add to units over time but we haven't at this point shared what percent of the mix will come from any one of those pieces. Instead what we're focused on and what we would ask you to think about is total subscriber growth north of 40. So ecosystem revenue growth north of 30 which is by the way an increase from what we've been saying. We've been saying 25 to 30 and then what we will continue to share with you at Investor Day is we watch the LTV -- are we actually acquiring those customers profitably and anything north of 3 is positive and we're well above that number when you blend it all in whether it's self-employed, it's new countries, or its core U.S. And so those three things should give us all confidence that we're growing a healthy and profitable franchise. Nandan Amladi : Thank you and a quick follow-up on QuickBooks Enterprise, you mentioned that you're expecting units to decline but revenue to be up slightly. How much impact are you seeing from consolidation in the market there Sage particularly entering the U.S. market with their purchase of Intact, is there any pressure to move to a cloud based solution in the enterprise family? Brad Smith : Thank you for the question because it gives us a chance to clarify something that I think we may have created a misperception. When we said that our QuickBooks desktop units will be declining that includes our core QuickBooks not just Enterprise. So we have a QuickBooks Pro, A QuickBooks Premier and then QuickBooks Enterprise. The Enterprise category actually isn\u2019t declining in units, it continues to grow and it tends to be the low end disruptor for that mid-market space where we're about 30% cheaper than the names that you just listed and our product and our Net Promoter Score tend to be better than those alternatives. So what we are saying is even though we have a decline in overall desktop units as more people now opt for the cloud with QBO or they even migrate over to QBO we still have a very healthy and growing QuickBooks Enterprise franchise that's growing both customers and market share and it's growing revenue and that's what's basically keeping the total desktop revenue ecosystem slightly positive. Nandan Amladi : Thank you. Brad Smith : You're welcome. Thank you for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your question please. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks, good afternoon. Neil it's been a real pleasure, congratulations to you and to Michelle. My question is on the new investment and just a feel for timing, is this a multi-year thing or are these four initiatives going to be in this single year, you mentioned EBIT margin will expand then you're going to rein in on share repurchases, is that a one year thing or a multi-year thing just a general gist of the question how are you going to approach it, thanks? Neil Williams : The increased investments Scott are really multi-year investments. I wouldn't think of them being incremental increases every year but I think our commitment is to do more things, fewer things really, really well and to really start and complete some projects that have the most impact. So I would think of it as clearly a multi-year assignment. On the share repurchase buyback I wouldn't overreact to that. If you look at what we have guided around our share count, the 15% dividend increase we're still going to be returning roughly 70% of our free cash flow through share buybacks and through dividend increases even at the low end. So we'll see how the market plays out and see what other investment opportunities we have but, as I said I think the adjustment in that program is going to be pretty modest. You think about 85% return this year in 2017 and probably something in low 70's for 2018. So it\u2019s going to be a pretty modest adjustment there. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks and just as a follow-up on comments Brad or Neil on seasonality for the upcoming tax season. I know it's early yet but we have the slow start this past year and IRS broad prevention. Just wondering what you're hearing at this point in the summer from the IRS and what you think we may expect and then as part of that prior question on your enhanced marketing spend Brad you said it was across the ecosystem, just curious how that might impact marketing in spend specifically in the TurboTax category tax category? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes Scott it\u2019s still really early to be able to anticipate what's going to happen but, if you just look at some of the leading indicators Congress is still trying to debate whether there will or won't be changes to tax flow. You've got a transition as a commissioner at the IRS it'll be occurring in the fall. Obviously you have new leadership stepping into some of our competitors roles and so I think at the end of the day it's going to be a Fast and Furious get everything done and get ready for tax season. So we're anticipating that we're agile, we're able to react, we've got quite a few years of doing it. And the other thing we do know is it is human nature as technology makes it easier and the last thing we want to think about is falling taxes that people continue to push later and later into the season. So I believe we're going to continue to deal with those kinds of phenomena.  In terms of the marketing stuff, we don't want to talk as I mentioned a few minutes ago about specifics around whether we're going to increase any focus in any particular product. What we are going to do as Neil said, as we reallocated dollars now that we see a healthy LTV to tax, we see our Net Promoter Score is really improving. I mentioned the QuickBooks Online at 22 points year-over-year and anytime we see that we say now's a good time to step on the accelerator and build category awareness and get our products out there. So I don't want to comment on what we're going to do with TurboTax other than to say we're excited for the whistle to blow and the new season to start. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Your question please. Sterling Auty : Yeah, thanks. I want to circle back to the consumer tax and some of the discussion around unit volumes. Can you give us a sense of what you saw in terms maybe some of the share shift at the low end versus the high end, and how does that play into your strategy for the upcoming tax year? Brad Smith : Yes Sterling, we will unpack more of that at Investor Day. We try to get as granular as we can without giving out too much of the secret thoughts. I would say overall we roughly held share this year and so on one hand you could say in a very complicated tax season where total IRS returns were not healthy and you had new competition and intense competition. You could say that's not so bad but for us it was disappointment because we always want to grow share at least a point each year. The second is we have lessons learned here. We've been around the block a few times and if I take you back to 2013 that was a year where we grew our unit 3%, we grew our revenue 4%, we came back to the locker room, we watched the game film and the next year we came out and we were able to grow the revenue -- the units 9% and the revenue 7%.  So we've come back and we've kind of figured out okay, what is it that we're excited about, what is it we think we could have done differently and what will we do as a result. And that stuff we will share a little bit closer to tax season. But right now I can tell you that we held share, we performed better in paid than we did in free and we think we had some good lessons learned on how we're going to go after that a little differently this year. Sterling Auty : And then one follow-up on QBO, given the increased focus here on SE, does it change how the inhibition engine around QBO works, in other words where you're investing more of the resources from a development effort? Brad Smith : Yeah, I want to at first just make sure that I have not left a false perception, when I say increased focus on assay that's not away from QBO. QBO has a ton of headroom and it was QBO that improved its Net Promoter Score 22 points year-over-year. And so that business is really accelerating. QBSE is incremental on top of that. It was a category that we used to over serve with QBO, they don't need full accounting. All they need is separating business personal expense, the ability to send that into a tax return or an accountant and then be able to track an invoice and get paid. So we have a right offering for self-employed and we have a right for me offering for QBO. So I would just simply say that today we feel like it's and not or and there isn't going to be any massive shift away from QBO to go after QBSE. Sterling Auty : That makes sense and just lastly, Neil congratulations. I am hoping that the Board presents you with a brand new Corvette and send you off right. Neil Williams : Thank you Sterling, it's a great idea. Sterling Auty : Thanks guys, for making my job a lot easier. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Your question please. James MacDonald : Yes, first congratulations Neil and good luck. Brad I was very interested in something you said in your later remarks about QBO growing 40% as a goal for apparently a longer period. As you get to these big numbers you are starting to add as many units as you used to have a couple years ago. Could you talk a little bit about how long you can keep doing that? Brad Smith : Yeah Jim, I know that there's always double edged sword when you get sort of a guiding principle like that and for us it is subscribers at 40% plus and the online ecosystem revenue of 30% plus but we really are early days here. The shift of the cloud has put all the decisions back up for consideration. I think I've shared in prior quarters that in 2005 we saw a tipping point where the number of people in TurboTax leaning towards the cloud was 50-50 versus desktop. You fast forward just a couple of years and it became 9010 for TurboTax, cloud versus desktop. Two years ago we hit that 50-50 tipping point with QuickBooks Online versus desktop when it came to new users, that number is now 80-20 people leaning to the cloud. And so as you think about more people waiting for the cloud more countries we can serve and you throw in SE on top of that which was a category we could never even go after in the past. We don't see in the near-term the next several years and need to back off of the 40% but if we do we will be the very first to come out and change the expectations but today is the law of large numbers we've got 800 million prospects and we currently have 2.3 million existing customers and we think there's plenty of room to grow it. James MacDonald : Great and we haven't talked about acquisitions in a while so I thought I would ask are acquisitions part of your investment approach in terms of maybe buying in some technology or talent? Brad Smith : Hey Jim they are. Typically as you just suggested they are technologies or products features that enable us to fill out a roadmap that will help us get the market faster for their talent. And when Neil mentioned artificial intelligence and machine learning as one of the four areas we're investing in, you can think of that being as much about talent acquisition as it is about the algorithms and capabilities we might buy in a product. So we are using M&A, it gets held to the same or a lot of hurdles as everything else, the 15% plus return over a five-year period. And so you really won't see any deviation from that as we look ahead. James MacDonald : Great thanks guys. Brad Smith : Thank you Jim. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your question please. Kartik Mehta : Hey good afternoon Brad. I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you said about the tax business transforming the assisted side and I'm wondering as you move up the ladder what kind of impact do you think that has on the tax segment from a revenue perspective and a margin perspective? Brad Smith : Yeah Kartik, I would say a couple things. One is we believe there's a lot more revenue opportunity to be captured there. We believe with the assets we bring and the accounting relationships we already have and then a platform or technology that matches a consumer who needs tax filing needs what they pro who may be willing to lean on that platform and help get those needs taken care of we think we have a lot of opportunity for growth on the revenue side. And we haven't provided any guidance around any revenue or margin expansion beyond next year. When we get to Investor Day you know we often share here's what the outlook you can think about a small business and tax and we\u2019ll talk more then but right now our guidance is 7% to 9% for next year which is a healthy year for TurboTax. Coming off of you know last year's guidance which was 6% to 8%. Kartik Mehta : And then maybe Brad you know you talked about anticipating about 0% to 1% growth in the overall tax market. What do you anticipate for DIY, what kind of a difference would you anticipate the DIY category will grow versus the total category? Brad Smith : Yeah I think there is a continuing trend that's gone on for more than a decade that that category DIY is secularly advantaged as people have grown up with technology and technology enables you to do some magical things. More and more people are choosing to do their taxes using software whether it is a PC or a mobile phone. And as you start to introduce concepts like SmartLook the ability to have a live video chat with a pro while doing your taxes on a phone or on a computer that's only going to expand the DIY category. You know historically it's been a 3% to 5% sort of category growth and so at this point we haven\u2019t deviated from that outlook. This year of course was a crazy year across the board for every category including the overall IRS. So we didn't quite see that growth like we would have expected but we don't think that this year is predictive of the future and I think if you look back over the last 10 you'll see that those numbers are pretty well supported. Kartik Mehta : Thanks Brad, I appreciate it. Brad Smith : Alright, take care Kartik. Kartik Mehta : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your question please. Raimo Lenschow : Thanks for taking my questions and all the best to you Neil from me as well. Brad it seems like around AI it seems to increase urgency from your side and I guess I see that from the market as well. Can you talk a little bit about the impact that the whole AI machine learning could have on your business, I mean it seems like the whole world is going to be reshaped here. I'm just thinking about how that will play out for Intuit and I know you probably talk a little bit more on the Analyst Day? Thank you. Brad Smith : Yeah, thank you Raimo. You\u2019re right, we're at this precipice now where all this is a massive amount of data and then the ability to match it with the processing power and the data storage and the smart algorithms kind of allow you do some pretty magical things for customers. And we don't kid ourselves. We know the categories we're in are required but not desired. People don\u2019t wake up excited about accounting or paying their taxes or paying their utility bill. And so we have three benefits that our customers have always expected of our products that is more money in their pocket with little to no work and complete self confidence that they didn't mess anything up in the process.  When you think about artificial intelligence it is uniquely suited to solve those problems. It can help you by looking at your characteristics, find better deals whether small business loans or lower credit card fees. It can help you get rid of the questions that you would have to answer in TurboTax or anything in accounting so you literally don't have to think about it so there's no work and it can double check your work for you to take the human being and match it with a computer so you have complete confidence that you didn't mess anything up. So we really do believe this is the core of our strategy going forward. And we're not at a standing start. We shared before we have over 100 patents that we have filed and we have over 30 applications in market but we're only ramping this up and we think it's going to be a big opportunity in the future. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect and one quick follow-up like on QBO you obviously saw in terms of unit growth a nice step-up this year and you know you guided for unit number for next year which is kind of slowing down the growth a little bit. What are the puts and takes because obviously you have a greater scale like we discussed a couple of questions before and what are the other factors we should think about there? Thank you. Brad Smith : Yeah and you know we were coming off of a really strong year this year as you mentioned. It was our first year of being able to take advantage as new country catching fire like the three Canada, UK, and Australia. We had our first year with TurboTax self-employed bundle which has been 170,000 units over into QuickBooks Online to the self-employed product. So we're going to some seasonality, we're going to have some comparison grow overs. And so when we gave our guidance for this year it's still that 40% plus number. And I expect coming out of the gates we're probably going to see some more favorable numbers because we are going to have some of those things we have compared against in the income tax season. We're going to have to grow over a pretty good year this year. But that's not to say we're out of gas and tax. As I mentioned a 170,000 of them are active and there's 3 million of them in the TurboTax base. So we plan to actually not make that an issue but that's why our guidance right now is in that 37% to 42% range. That is not a ceiling for us. We simply think we have some grow over we're going to have as we continue to learn and figure out how we're going to keep this accelerator going. Raimo Lenschow : Lovely, thank you, congratulations. Brad Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your question please. Michael Millman : So following up on what you discussed a couple questions on tax. One is over the last three years what's the number of distinct visitors that you had on tax and kind of related to that you've been talking without saying just the word disruptive. But in terms of tax where -\u2013 which market share does it translates into disruptive and then have another question? Brad Smith : Okay Michael I'm in the clarification on the second that on the first one around the number of unique visitors we had a slide that we put in our Investor Day in the fall and it has fiscal year 15 and fiscal year 16 we haven't yet released 17 we'll do that in the fall when we come back together in October. We had 89 million unique visitors that logged in fiscal year 15 it went to 92 million in fiscal year 16 and we'll talk more about what we saw when we get together in October for 17. So I say a very large population of people that come to TurboTax.com each year. Now could you help me with your second question around disruptive. Michael Millman : Disruptive means taking that number and increasing conversion so I'm not sure what conversion is now but maybe you can give us an idea ask in a different way of how much you can increase conversion and what would that mean in terms of. How many returns that you could be doing? Brad Smith : Okay. Guys you know I think that will probably be easy for us to walk through with a funnel when we get together in October and we'll try to unpack for you sort of what goes from A. Someone who's unique visitors someone who actually clicks into the product and tries it to someone who converts and becomes a full time user. But I can tell you at the highest level roughly 155 million people are filing their taxes 92 million came to TurboTax a year ago we ended up with roughly 35 million who filed with TurboTax and then if you throw in our Pro segment you know we've got roughly 55 million to 60 million between those two products. We think SmartLook plus the improvements in our TurboTax product give us the ability to serve a much larger population of those 150 plus million that we are today and that while we talk about transform I don't know if I would use the word disruptive because the accountants are our friends here we're working with them and they're providing the expert service but we do plan to be disruptive to competitive alternatives because we think we can do it with the more advanced technology at a lower price point for customers and they can and that's what we plan to try to prove. Michael Millman : And the other question is on the desktop with the grey area prepare has kind of moved out of the market where do you see desktop going? Brad Smith : Desktop is becoming as it is in the consumer space and now the small business space as we look at the accounting professional they are leaning aggressively into our cloud based solutions and they're wanting to collaborate with their clients whether they're consumers are small businesses using cloud technology. The ability to exchange documents electronically. Now it is in earlier days there we haven't hit the 50 :50 tipping point. So we have definitely seen on the accountant side more people using our online product and competitors have also tried to introduce online products. If we go back to TurboTax We have 90% in the cloud and 10% in the desktop. Those desktop customers are sticky they don't indicate right now they want to move to the cloud and we're fine with that because we're able to deliver and serve them efficiently. But, when it comes to the pros it's much earlier days. Michael Millman : Thank you. Brad Smith : Alright, thank you. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from Jesse Hulsing of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Shannon for Jesse. On the small business side what are your expectations for ARPU trajectory in 2018, fiscal 2018. I mean understand the subscriber base is still growing very strongly globally including the self-employment which would pressure ARPU but I think I'd be helpful to get your view on the puts and takes there and potential upside drivers? And also quick follow-up for Neil are there any updates you can share at this time on ASC606? Thank you. Brad Smith : Alright let me take the first one and I\u2019ll hand it to Neil for the accounting treatment. On ARPU as you know we have talked about this. It's a mix thing so on an apple-to-apple basis we continue to see opportunities to improve the revenue per customer for self-employed. The revenue per customer outside the U.S. and the revenue per customer for the QBO customers in the U.S. When you put it all together you see that ARPU number looking like it's going down because we're growing fast in the self-employed segment. We're growing quickly outside the U.S. But for us ARPU is not what we focus on. What we ask everybody to focus on is the ecosystem revenue growing faster than 30. It was just 90 days ago that we used to guide 25 to 30 and so it's getting healthy and healthier and our lifetime value to tax continues to be an opportunity for us to get those customers efficiently. We\u2019ll talk a little bit more, Neil often does this, we will do it at Investor Day, we will show a chart that says APRU overall by product line which direction is it moving. But, I would say when you put it into the mix the best thing to focus on would be to focus on revenue at the ecosystem level growing faster than 30. Neil you want to take the second? Neil Williams : The headline 0606 is it is not going to have a significant impact on our results over the next few years. We may see some movement in the quarters and so our quaterization may change a little bit on our tax products but at total company level and at the full year level it's not going to have a significant impact on our results. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your question please. Brad Reback : Great, thanks very much. Neil just real quickly with the push to AWS does that longer term change the CAPEX requirements of the business and sort of as a corollary to that does it impact the gross margin percentage looking forward? Thanks Brad Smith : Yeah Brad, the primary reason we're so eager to move to AWS is really to enable developer productivity. It enables to get things tested and get features out to market faster. So it's a big component there of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our developers. That said you'll notice that there is some improvement or some decrease in our CAPEX spending in 2017 versus the 2016 and 2018 versus 2017. So there's certainly an impact there. I frankly don't think the impact on the gross margin is going to be huge. But it's certainly going to have an impact but the bigger driver above all is to try to get more efficiency and effectiveness out of our R&D dollars. And I think that's where you'll see some big improvement in getting products and getting things to market faster. Brad Reback : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you and as there are no further questions in queue would you like to close with any additional remarks. Brad Smith : Yes Latif, thank you. First of all we want to thank everybody for the questions today. We obviously covered a lot of territory not the least of which was the news that both Neil and Michelle have announced. And we're excited for both of them. If you take anything away from the call what I hope you hear from Neil myself today is we're pleased with our results for fiscal year 2017. We are increasingly encouraged by the momentum that we are carrying into fiscal year 2018. We are looking forward to seeing you at our Investor Day where we will share more about our refresh mission and our strategy and how all these pieces come together and until then we hope you have a great remainder of the summer. Thanks everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

My name is James and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer. Natoli? Jerry Natoli : Thanks, James and thanks for all for joining us. James, we couldn\u2019t quite hear you, so hopefully the line is open. If it\u2019s not, please work the communications line and let us know. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. I am here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO; Neil Williams, our CFO; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our incoming CFO. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2017 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I will turn the call over to Brad. Brad Smith : Thanks, Jerry, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We are off to a strong start in fiscal year 2018. In the first quarter, we grew revenue 14% and exceeded our overall financial targets. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 17%, with QuickBooks Online subscribers growing 56% and the online ecosystem revenue growing 35%. Both the Consumer Group and Strategic Partner Group revenues were also in line with our expectations. With that backdrop, let me share some observations on our business overall, starting with the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth continues at a rapid pace, with online ecosystem revenue accelerating. We exited the quarter with over 2.5 million QuickBooks Online subscribers, surpassing the 2 million subscriber milestone during the quarter in the United States, while our non-U.S. base grew 70% year-over-year to approximately 550,000 subscribers. Within QuickBooks Online, Self-Employed subscribers grew to roughly 425,000, up from 390,000 last quarter and 110,000 just 1 year ago. The strong growth in QBO customers and online ecosystem revenue reflects our focus on improving the customer experience and delivering what matters most in their lives when choosing our products that is more money, no work and complete confidence. Our teams are laser focused on delivering these customer benefits and they have produced a steady flow of new features and capabilities, many of which were showcased at our QuickBooks Connect conference last week. Our QBO innovations are resonating with customers, with our most recent net promoter scores once again improving this time by more than 6 points, on top of the 22 point improvement we drove last year. These improvements are reflected in each geography around the globe positioning us well versus local alternatives and giving us confidence in continuing our expected QBO subscriber growth north of 40%, with online ecosystem revenue growth of more than 30%. Turning to the Consumer Group, first quarter revenue finished in line with our expectations, up 7% year-over-year. We are gearing up for the upcoming tax season and remain laser focused on delivering an outstanding end-to-end customer experience for do-it-yourself taxpayers. We are also launching our new TurboTax Live offering, leveraging technology for those seeking access to a tax expert on demand. Our experience with October tax extension filers gave us an opportunity to run some water through the pipes and we are encouraged by the results as we head into the season. As we discussed last quarter, our Consumer Group now includes Mint and personal financial management. We unveiled our new Turbo platform at the Money 20/20 Conference in mid-October. Turbo was the first step towards expanding beyond a tax offering to a consumer platform. This platform will improve the overall financial health of the end-user. Turbo goes beyond a credit score and unleashes the power of verified IRS-filed income, the credit score and the debt-to-income ratio to show customers who give consent where they truly stand. We announced an exciting slate of initial partners who will use the platform to provide offerings for participating customers starting early in calendar 2018. Moving on to the Strategic Partners Group, our professional tax revenue was also in line with our expectations for the quarter. We continue to focus on multi-service accounting firms that do both books and taxes. This is in service to driving our accountant\u2019s success, while growing our small business ecosystem. Putting a bow around the quarter, we are off to a strong start to fiscal 2018 and we are excited about our prospects for the year. With that overview, let me hand it to Neil to walk you through the financial details. Neil Williams : Thanks, Brad and good afternoon everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we delivered revenue of $886 million, up 14% year-over-year, a GAAP operating loss of $57 million versus $61 million a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income of $43 million versus $32 million last year, GAAP loss per share of $0.07 versus $0.12 last year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.11, up from $0.06 last year. Turning to the business segments, total Small Business and Self-Employed revenue grew 17% in the quarter, up from 14% in fiscal 2017. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth remains strong at 56%, ending the quarter with 2.552 million subscribers. Small business online ecosystem revenue accelerated to 35% in the first quarter from 30% in fiscal 2017. Online accounting continues to drive this revenue growth. We expect year-over-year QBO subscriber growth to slow in the second half of the year due to the introduction of the Self-Employed bundle last tax season. We remain confident in our outlook for growth in QBO subs as reflected in our fiscal 2018 guidance of 3.275 to 3.375 million subscribers. We also continue to expect online ecosystem revenue to grow better than 30%. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 8% in the quarter driven by QuickBooks Enterprise strength. QuickBooks Desktop units fell 35%. Remember that operating system changes in the year ago period led customers to upgrade to the newest desktop version, which drove strong unit growth last year. For fiscal 2018, we expect QuickBooks Desktop units to decline mid-teens and desktop ecosystem revenue to be up mid single-digits. Total Consumer revenue was up 7% for the quarter, while professional tax revenue within the Strategic Partner Group grew 2%. Looking ahead, I am excited about the opportunity TurboTax Live provides to address the needs of more tax filers. We typically see 3 million prior year TurboTax customers go to a pro each year. TurboTax Live provides us the opportunity to keep more of these customers in our franchise. Turning to our financial principles, we continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management. We finished the quarter with approximately $780 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet. Our first priority for cash remains investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. Next, we use acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return cash that we can\u2019t invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased $170 million of shares in the first quarter. Approximately $1.4 billion remains on our authorization. We expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share payable January 18, 2018, an increase of 15% over last year. Our Q2 fiscal 2018 guidance provides revenue growth of 14% to 16%, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.08 to $0.11, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.31 to $0.34. You can find our Q2 and fiscal 2018 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. Finally, I would just like to say that I am thankful for the opportunity to work with you Brad for the last 10 years. It has been the highpoint of my career to learn from you and to laugh with you during our time together and I will miss you. Brad Smith : There are no words, although I will share some at the end of the call, but I do say that this last 10 years have flown by like it was just blink of an eye. It\u2019s been an awesome ride. Shifting back to the business, we are pleased with the strong start to the fiscal year and we look forward to accelerating our momentum as we head into peak season. We couldn\u2019t be more proud of the work that our employees are doing. With that, let\u2019s open it up to hear what\u2019s on your mind. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. Brent, on QuickBooks capital, I was curious if you could just talk a little bit about your aspirations and as I understand it, in the past you had a group of connected lenders that would loan to small businesses. I think now you are putting your own capital out to these small businesses. Can you just walk through the dynamics and how this changes in this initiative? And I had a quick follow-up. Brad Smith : Sure, Brent. Let me start by saying that our goal remains unchanged. If you look at the number of small businesses and self-employed who are seeking access to credit, 70% of them still get turned down and yet we have visibility into things that most lenders don\u2019t have, most only have a look backwards at history. We also have a look forwards. We have over 26 billion transactions in the QuickBooks ecosystem that we are able to look at, that includes forward-looking things like inventory on hand, invoices outstanding, cash flow, projects and process and it\u2019s a combination of the past and the future and a proprietary algorithm that we think has led to a credit score or a credit rating system that is much more predictive of good businesses in which you can invest. And case in point is so far to date 60% of the loans that we have been able to issue were facilitate have been to people that would have been considered unlendable by other institutions. So, we are really excited to get access to capital into the hands of these small businesses and self-employed.  To your second question, we think this could be a very promising opportunity over the long-term, but our use of capital was really to fuel or prime the top. What we needed to do was get a rapid feedback loop on whether our algorithms were predicting the things that we needed, so it would make it a better tool for other lenders. And so we, at this point in time, don\u2019t have plans to become a bank and we don\u2019t have plans to lean into that aggressively as opposed to using it as a way for us to tune our algorithms and make it a really good platform for other lenders to be able to provide access to capital. So, that\u2019s sort of the summary of QuickBooks capital and hopefully answers your question. Brent Thill : Great. And just a quick follow-up on the QuickBooks business and the growth rate in the back half of the year, I know you cited a couple of factors, but I think one of the questions we had from investors is given how big the market is and how early it is, why the growth rate should be fading at this point, any perspective it doesn\u2019t sound like there is any fundamentally off, but just curious kind of what the rationale is given how early this is and why you would see that type of thing? Brad Smith : Yes, there is no fundamental weakness in the business itself. As you have heard, the net promoter scores are improving in every geography. We are seeing strong funnel management. We just released a whole new set of innovations at QuickBooks Connect last week that we think will only accelerate conversion of the funnel. It\u2019s just the reality of last year we opened up one of the biggest channels any company could hope for which is 100 million people visiting turbotax.com in a 100-day period and we got a nice pause of customers that we have exposed to that for the first time. And so we are going to have that grow over. We don\u2019t view that as a foundational or a systemic weakening, we simply view that as a seasonality thing and we will see how strong we can go through tax season, but right now we just want to manage expectations that we did get a big tranche of customers in that period of time we want to make sure that we know the second half compares are a little more difficult than the first half. Brent Thill : Thank you. Brad Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much guys. And Neil, we will definitely miss you and congratulations on your 10 years at Intuit. Brad, question for you, can you talk a little bit more about TurboTax Live specific segment of the market that you are trying to go after, is there any \u2013 on the flipside potential of cannibalization albeit you may experience higher ASP even if that were to happen, but what is it that you are looking to uncover here and how solid is the market research that you have conducted to validate the true potential for TurboTax Live? Thank you so much. Brad Smith : Great. Thank you, Kash. Well, step back and look at the market and we\u2019ll size the U.S. at a little over 150 million returns go to the IRS and somewhere approaching 90 million of those turn to an expert, whether it\u2019s an tax store or a tax professional to answer questions or to complete their taxes for them. And when we get underneath that, the series of questions sometimes will just go as far as if I only had the answer to one nagging question, I would have been happy to do my taxes myself and it\u2019s really where TurboTax Live leans in. Now, we have two flavors of TurboTax Live. We have to do it with me where we offer advice and then there is do it for me where we can take over the return and complete the return for you and sign it and those are both going to be in the marketplace, but we think the big opportunity is going to be that advice giving. A lot of people out there have simpler taxes and they simply have a nagging question based upon a life event change. They had a child. They moved between states. They sold stock and being able to actually get a tax expert on demand answered that question and then go on and finish your taxes we think is a big opportunity. I don\u2019t see this as cannibalization. We actually see this as an opportunity to extend our value further into the market that historically has not moved to the do-it-yourself category or may actually switch from DIY to a tax pro, because they lost confidence. We think it\u2019s a great retention tool as well as an opportunity to go into a part of the market we have underserved. Kash Rangan : That\u2019s fantastic. Do you have enough capacity to handle the demand if it surges, because that sounds like a terrific value proposition. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me. Brad Smith : Yes. Kash, I would tell you as we went through the tax filing extension season in October, we not only were able to validate there is real demand in the market on the consumer side. There is real interest on the professional side and they like the experience of the platform we have created. We were also able to run waters to pipes and our ability to scale. Now, obviously as we get into season, we are going to continue to learn, because there will be more volume and volume as we go closer to April 15, but right now, we have confidence to say we feel like we have got a strong operational model that has both consumer and tax professional benefit and we are really excited for the season to come. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Fall with William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Fall : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to follow-up a bit on TurboTax Live, so first of all, I think you mentioned that there is typically around 3 million TurboTax customers that go to a pro every year. Just wondering in terms of those customers that switchover, is it the case that they start the return and then run into a roadblock and switch to a pro or does something happen prior to them even starting their tax return that motivates them to switch over to a pro? And then I guess parlaying on that, how do you go about communicating to these customers or getting the message out there to sort of stop them from moving over to a pro? And then also in terms of the Live offering just kind of wondering the initial feedback you have heard from accounts and how confident you are that you will be able to build up that network big enough to handle any demand that you have on that offering to provide a good experience? Thanks. Brad Smith : Right. Thanks, Matt. So, you are right, we did reference 3 million TurboTax customers who year-over-year end up losing confidence in themselves, simply because of a live event change and they asked to go to a professional. Sometimes for that next year, sometimes it could be for a couple of years, we have to win them back. Sometimes, that decision is made before even logging into the product, many times as once they get into the product and they realize that they have now had a child that\u2019s crossed the magic gate and they can no longer claim them as a deduction where they sold stock and they start to lose confidence. So, how are we reaching them? Two ways, you are going to see our go-to-market campaigns and our advertising talking about the ability now to have a tax expert on demand. So, if you don\u2019t log into the product, you will now know you can, because you have a tax expert that will be included with the software. For those that are in the product, we have in-product discovery, so if see you hovering too long in a particular area and throughout the product there is perpetual link that says if you want to get access to an expert simply press here. So we have both outside the product advertising and inside the product advertising.  In terms of the experience, two things have that happened. We are way ahead of our expectations and our ability to recruit the number of professionals we think we\u2019ll need for season. We have milestones for every month leading up to season and we are ahead of this milestone in terms of people signing up for the service. So we think we\u2019ll have very strong professional supply. And the second is the net promoter scores of those tax professionals during the October extension season was above our targeted goal. So we are excited both in the volume of professionals we\u2019re able to recruit, but also the experience they\u2019re enjoying so far, now we have to see if we can sustain those levels as we get into the peak tax season. Matt Fall : Great. That\u2019s it from me guys. Thanks. Brad Smith : Okay. Thanks Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [Indiscernible] for Keith Weiss. I have two questions for you guys. One in terms of this year in terms of international expansion plans, any new countries that are coming onboard this year that\u2019s important to flag? Brad Smith : At this point, we haven\u2019t announced additional countries. As we often say, we have so much opportunity in the countries we are in. We have real acceleration happening in Canada, the UK and Australia. We are still working to get that last mile of compliance and product market fit in France, India and in Brazil. We do have tests going on in other countries, we\u2019ve referenced in prior calls, but those tests have not yet validated that we\u2019re ready to go back into this market. And so at this point in time, I would say the countries we\u2019ve announced are the ones we would stay focused on and that is still a 224 million prospect opportunity and as we just celebrated 2.55 million subscribers, we got a lot of headroom just in those countries. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s super helpful. And then maybe talk \u2013 go back to the commentary on the Apollo back to the commentary on the TurboTax bundle. Any early indications on what retention rates might be for those cohorts of customers that singed on last year any sort of early leading on whether they\u2019re staying on board weather \u2013 whether they\u2019re exiting higher than normal? Neil Williams : Yes, David. I think the proof is going to be in the tax preparation season. The customers that have that bundle now look good in terms of their retention and their attributes. But we all know that is the tax preparation process itself that is the big value proposition for these customers. And so I think we want to get through an entire filing season and have a full annual cycle these customers before we get to definitive about what their retention characteristics are. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you so much. Brad Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Adam Holt : Hi, thanks so much. It\u2019s Adam Holt from MoffettNathanson. Hi, guys. How are you? Brad Smith : Hey, Adam. We are doing great. How are you, buddy? Adam Holt : I\u2019m very well. Thank you. So another good first quarter and I had two questions on the QuickBooks business. First, it looks like outstanding year-on-year margin expansion in QuickBooks, it look like 3, 4 points on year-on-year basis despite strong unit growth. you\u2019ve talked a lot about the different factors that drive that, but maybe as relates specifically this quarter what did you see that enable you expand margins so much? Brad Smith : Adam, the seasonality I think is something that can play some tricks in terms of trying to do the margins announces there, we don\u2019t really look at it on a too much on a quarter-by-quarter basis. As I mentioned on the call, the accounting revenue is really what\u2019s driving the top line the revenue growth our retention rates for QuickBooks is doing nicely. And so that\u2019s held up the revenue side really well, but our expenses and our investments are not really, not evenly distributed throughout the year. So we\u2019re excited about where it is, but it\u2019s going to move around a bit through the year. So we\u2019re excited about the customer growth and the top line growth for sure. Adam Holt : Well, apologize I\u2019m going to ask another quarter or unit question. But you beat numbers this quarter and as \u2013 as we\u2019ve in the past sometimes you roll that into the year and in this case you did as well, so the annual numbers don\u2019t change, which means we\u2019ve got to take down a numbers a little bit in one of the forward quarters. Given what you said about the tough comps in QuickBooks we seem to be tougher in Q3, should we a) assume that the delta is in QuickBooks and b) assume that, that principally falls in the third quarter? That\u2019s it for me. Thanks so much. Brad Smith : Adam, I think that definitely the small business group was one driving the revenue growth in Q1. We do think that we have got a talk grow-over in Q3 particularly in small business. And so that\u2019s one of the overall guidance we have given for the year for revenue and for subs takes that into account, that\u2019s why we have been cautioning people that we are going to have a tough compare when we get to those self-employed bundle units in Q3. So, I would look to the full year guidance both in terms of online ecosystem revenue and in terms of subs and think about how Q2 and Q3 play out for those, but I would stick \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t get far away from the full year guidance on either revenue or subs for the small business segment. Adam Holt : Great. Thanks so much. Brad Smith : Take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Nemeroff : Hi, great. Thanks. Congrats on a good quarter and Neil been nice working with you. Good luck going forward. Brad, I wanted to ask about TurboTax Live, I know there has been a bunch of questions on it, but can you give us a sense of what pricing has looked like during this trial period and how you expect that to be priced going into this tax season and then for that\u2019s it for the second? Brad Smith : Hi, Michael. So, many of you have been going through the product and we have spoken to you offline and you have been a part of our test sales. We have been testing a lot of price points out there. We have not yet announced our pricing. It\u2019s still a little too far out for us to give competition or others that not, but I would say that what you are going to see it\u2019s going to be a premium to the current price points we have in the TurboTax lineup, but we have not landed yet on what that price point will be or announced it, but you don\u2019t mind, I have asked you to pull that back and we will get a little closer to see and then you will see the price points out there. Michael Nemeroff : Okay, great. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Brad Smith : You are welcome. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jesse Hulsing of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jesse Hulsing : Yes, thank you. Brad, I wanted to ask about turbo which it sounds like you are launching next year if you were to compare turbo to some of the other consumer finance platforms out there, I guess like credit card and others, what\u2019s the value proposition to consumers to get them to use the app? And I guess if you are a partner institution looking at turbo versus the others, what\u2019s the value proposition for those partner institutions and lenders? Brad Smith : Great. Thank you, Jesse. Let me start with just the interaction model. Our mission is to power prosperity. And for the consumer group, it is to provide financial freedom for consumers and so financial freedom has a 365 day a year task. Historically with TurboTax, we enjoy two interactions with customers a year, where Mint enjoyed 112 interactions with customers. The challenge is both were incomplete on a standalone basis, but when you bring them together as a platform and then you begin to look at the other customer and partner data that we have in our ecosystem we believe we can provide a platform that can help individuals and families better manage their financial health. The reason being is not unlike what I shared with QuickBooks capital, because we have access to more data and it\u2019s not only backward-looking, but forward-looking. Today with the credit score what you can basically get with that is access to more credit cards. But if you had debt to income ratio, if you have IRS filed income that\u2019s been verified by the government. So, it\u2019s a real source of income and you also have the credit score, you can put the combination to those three things together and you can start to do some pretty wonderful things for consumers. You can help them find better financing for student loans, you can help them get lower credit card fees you can help them get access to mortgages to get better loans for car loan and a whole host of other things. So, we fundamentally believe that the data we have, the algorithms that we have written and the partners, the 40 that came with Mint, the more than half a dozen that have already signed up for Turbo and you put them together with others, we think we are going to be able to start to solve some important financial problems for consumers that others in the market just quite frankly can\u2019t match today. And that\u2019s the excitement. We still have much to prove. So, we haven\u2019t baked a lot of that into any financials for this year, but we sure have a team focused on it and we think we are on something that could be really meaningful for consumers if we get it right. Jesse Hulsing : That\u2019s helpful, Brad. And a question about QuickBooks Online, it looks like ARPU was flat year-over-year and which is great to see given the increasing self-employed mix and international mix. It was also flat year-over-year in the first quarter of last year and then declined year-over-year in the second, third, fourth quarter. So I am wondering, do you expect that same pattern to play out through the remainder of this year? Thank you. Brad Smith : You are welcome. I appreciate the question. If you go to our Investor Day deck, Neil did a wonderful job of laying out a page on ARPU on what we expected the trends to be going forward. And basically if I had to summarize that for you, because it has individual QBO U.S., QBO non-U.S., QuickBooks self-employed lay them all out. What you\u2019re going to see is the health of the ARPU on a cohort basis is getting stronger up all those cohorts, but when you put it together is a mix. You\u2019re going to have downward pressure on ARPU. So as you said, I would echo what you said, flat given the growth we\u2019re seeing outside the U.S. and the self-employed is a good thing that you should know underneath the ARPU is getting healthier in each of this cohorts and it\u2019s only a good news story every time. So I think Neil\u2019s page in the Investor Day deck kind of lays out what our expectations are for ARPU and I think if you refer back to that it\u2019s pretty much said what you just assumed. Jesse Hulsing : Thanks Brad. Brad Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Brad, now we are through the extended filing season, I was wondering if you had any sort of thoughts when you \u2013 when you look back and you got the sort of last piece of the data from last year. Did it inform your view on the upcoming season and all just in terms of baseline units to start with I mean sounds like everything is pretty much in line what your \u2013 what you thought. But I just want to double check on that? Brad Smith : Yes, last year still one of those years that\u2019s going to play out as an anomaly, not unlike 2013, I think when you throw everything and including extensions is still going to be hovering around flat as a tax season of total IRS returns. And we had anticipated between 0 and 1% growth, I know we were a little more muted in our expectations than many in the industry. However, as we look ahead, we still have that same sort of an outlook for the coming year. We think it\u2019s 0 to 1% growth here in total returns, no one has really been able to diagnose, I was just meeting with the IRS Commissioner and my peers in the industry 3 weeks ago in Washington, no one had a better hypothesis for what happened in tax season other than who knows and we\u2019ll just have to gear up and get ready for this season. So it hasn\u2019t changed our expectations for this year, I think we\u2019re looking at fairly modest total returns growth happening at the government level. Kirk Materne : Okay. And just the legislation pushing through Congress right now, does that change any thoughts in terms of just the shape of the season from a seasonal perspective in your view or is it still more of a \u2013 we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what happens? Brad Smith : Yes, at this point, it doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re right there\u2019s still a lot that we\u2019re going to wait and see. If there is positive news, it\u2019s both coming out of the House and Senate most of the recommendations are proactive versus retroactive. Retroactive will comes an operational challenge for the IRS and then that cascade down to industry and sometime that leads to delayed tax filing season. If Congress can actually get through either sometime before the end of the calendar year or early January as long as it\u2019s proactive, we still believe the shape of the season, we pretty much the same. There is just one caveat there and a one caveat of all those who\u2019ve looked calendar closely. This year\u2019s Q2 will have one extra filing day and it\u2019s just the way that calendar works for us and one day and 100 day eight season can move things around just a little bit. The total season we don\u2019t really see anything, we think it\u2019s going to fundamentally reshape the curve. Kirk Materne : Great. That\u2019s it from me. And Neil, best of luck going forward. Neil Williams : Thanks, Kirk. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Millman with Millman Research. Your line is open. Michael Millman : Thank you. And also looking at the IRS kind of information, so really two areas of question, first understand the deduction increase assuming increase how do you see this impacting both though taxpayers now who are using assistant because they have all these deductions, computations and now they may not and sort of similarly how do you see those who are now using do-it-yourself and say boy it\u2019s gotten so simple. I can do this myself, maybe you can put some numbers to those things. And then I have another question. Brad Smith : Yes. Thank you, Michael. I think your overall thesis is similar to ours and that is the more success we have in getting the tax code simplified, the more success that will drive category growth for the do-it-yourself category. Many people turn to an expert today, because they have a nagging question or they think it\u2019s too complicated. So, we think the simpler, Congress gets the tax code that\u2019s better news for the do-it-yourself category. And as you know that\u2019s the number one lever of growth for us. One point of category growth is worth several points of revenue for us if it plays out. The second is the do-it-yourself category I think software is the answer. I mean, if you look at the IRS they will tell you they don\u2019t have the bodies to process paper returns like they did even 5 years ago. So, if someone says it\u2019s so simple like do it myself, they are going to use software to do it and so we just have to make sure we have the best most effective software for them to get that done. So I think by and large a simplification is good news story for do-it-yourself category. Michael Millman : Okay. And related, it\u2019s in simplification is the postcard or return and I know you fought against this in California, so we have got to assume there is things about it you don\u2019t like and maybe you can talk about what you see coming forward if indeed we have tax on a postcard? Brad Smith : Yes. Thanks, Michael. Let me try to clarify what we were standing for and standing against in California. We were for simplification, we have been for more than a decade and we were for getting it so simply you can get it done on a postcard. Where we draw the line is we are believers and supporters in voluntary compliance, which is the citizen has the right to determine what they believe they owe the government and it\u2019s the burden of the government to prove that they are wrong and not the other way around. It shouldn\u2019t be the government actually sending out this form and saying here is what you owe us and then people who may have English as their second language or people who maybe intimidated by the government paying a number that maybe overpaid, because they are just nervous. So, what we have done just to be candid with you is while it was up in Washington a few weeks ago we have even built prototypes that we have shown Congress and the administration on how private industry can help them build this postcard for them, so that they can execute the plan they want to deliver we think that will be a wonderful thing. We just believe at the end of the day it\u2019s the individual\u2019s right to determine what their tax obligation is and it is not the government\u2019s role to come in and say I am going to tell you what you owe me and pay me the money. Michael Millman : So assuming the government takes your advice, what kind of impact would you see on the do-it-yourself business? Brad Smith : Well, I am not sure the government will take my advice. I think the good news is industry overall as well as Congress many members of Congress have been on the record saying that this is the way the country was founded so many years ago as we felt that we should have the ability to determine what we owe based upon the set of rules and laws and not have somebody dictate to us what they are going to make us pay. So with that sentiment and we happen to be in that camp, we believe at end of the other day, the simpler this thing gets, the more people kind of move into do-it-yourself and I think it\u2019s going to be a real accelerant, not only for the economy, but for the category and then ultimately for us if we do our job. Michael Millman : Okay, thank you and Neil, best of luck in the future. Neil Williams : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much. Brad, we did a survey recently looking at TurboTax Live and those I guess two things that I was interested to ask I know you are not talking about pricing specifically, but I believe the assisted category has call it revenue or dollars per return that are something like 4x what Turbo Tax currently has. And as you think about the pricing model for this new offering, I am just curious if you could frame it in that context and I guess just trying to think about that envelope and how far you think you maybe able to go? And then secondarily we also found that other services like audit insurance and fraud protection could also sway customer decisions and I would think those would be important for folks that are maybe have more complex filings. So, I was just curious for your thoughts around sort of bundling some additional services with the TurboTax Live offering to try to increase that participation? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes, thank you Ross and always appreciate the work that you and your team do with the surveys in the end market discoveries. Your analysis is correct if you take a look at the average revenue per return we get in TurboTax, it\u2019s a little more north of $50. If you look at what an average tax store charge is, it\u2019s in that $180 to $220 range and you can go to a pro at $300 or $400. So, that\u2019s multiple of the current price point of TurboTax. We are here today to tell you or anybody else on the call that we are announcing a 4x price point on TurboTax Live. In fact what you should here is we think we have a disruptive business model that will allow us to provide better value for the customer and at the same time be able to half and be a part of TurboTax franchise. So just know that somewhere north of where we are and south of where they are is probably going to be in the ZIP Code where the pricing will be. And then you\u2019re on really important point with everything happening in the market today whether it\u2019s cyber threats or other things whether it\u2019s audit insurance or its fraud protection those are absolutely the kind of services we continue to not only market ourselves that look at creatively bundling with other products. As we get closer to see it, then we\u2019ll hear a little bit more about those things, but that is the right theme, people are looking for peace of mind and some assurance that if anything happens to them that we\u2019ve got there back and that\u2019s what we want to continue to be there for. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much. Congrats as well, Neil and good luck for the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just curious well, there has been a lot to talk about timing fiscal second, third quarter and thanks for the extra filing day that\u2019s interesting and I realized others things can move around relative to the guidance like maybe what comes out of the tax bill or other items, but I am just curious the PATH Act was disruptive last year on the consumer tax side. So Brad or Neil what\u2019s the consideration in the guidance for the start of the tax season? How strong or weak are you expecting there and does that play into the guidance? Brad Smith : Yes, Scott. We think the last year was an opportunity not only for the market, but for all that\u2019s in the industry to adjust to the PATH Act, there is definitely a little bit of shock in all last year, no matter how hard we try to educate the end user once they finally fell into that muscle memory of filing their taxes. A lot of them were still surprised they weren\u2019t going to be able to get their money until in February. I think that experience that they went through plus the experience we all had in conjunction with the IRS is we anticipate is going to be a new normal now, in terms of what the path acts impact will be. So we don\u2019t really see any meaningful or material shift year-over-year, that\u2019s all subject to no surprises coming out of Congress between now and tax filing season. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks. Appreciate that. And then Neil, if we can bring you on since it\u2019s probably our last chance, kind of a similar question along the line of obviously there are a lot of investments going on this year and I am just curious how that might affect seasonality second quarter and third quarter this year and maybe things we might want to consider on the marketing front? Thank you. Neil Williams : Yes, Scott. I think that the seasonality for Q2 and Q3 on the investments side both in R&D and in marketing, I don\u2019t follow a similar path as a last year. It may be invested a little differently in some different ways, but we may have reallocated a bit within the categories, but I wouldn\u2019t expect to see anymore shifts between quarters then you saw the last few years. Obviously, Q1 and Q4 are the lightest quarters for us, but Q2 and Q3 are the critical periods for us and the investment levels in those quarters are pretty well baked. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Appreciate it and best wishes. Neil Williams : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is open. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. I wanted to sort of following up in last question, but looking at the OpEx and it looks like in Q1 there was a pretty material step up quarter-over-quarter and year-and-year and I know Neil you commented earlier that there\u2019s always some shifting, but I noticed here is also going to be a an investment focus here for you as well. Since we look at the spending in Q1 and the step up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in that metric? How much of that we think of as maybe spending that got normally would happened later in the year that just happened a little earlier versus how much is attached to things like hiring that might persist throughout the course of the year? Neil Williams : Hi, Jennifer. I think the level you saw in Q1 is really reflective of the investments we are making throughout fiscal year 2018. So again, I wouldn\u2019t assume that it was necessarily front end loaded, but we outlined 4 areas on Investor Day that we really wanted to lean into in 2018 and make significant progress areas like machine learning or artificial intelligence or transition to AWS, improving market productivity and things like that. So you should expect and assume that in Q1 it reflects a higher level baked in throughout the year. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Wells with Citi. Your line is open. Matthew Wells : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m on for Walter Pritchard. And we were at your QBO Connect in San Jose last week we thought you guys all did a really good job. And we get the sense that you are positioning QuickBooks desktop to move upstream essentially targeting SMEs, can you add anything here and just maybe comment on how higher ARPU QBE customers are contributing to growth in desktop? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes, thank you Mathew and first of all thank you for coming to QuickBooks Connect. For those, who aren\u2019t able to make it, it was I think at the 4 years perhaps the very best. We had over 5,000 attendees there, over 70,000 screaming live, energy level amongst the participants was amazing and speakers was incredible. And also the number of innovations we unveiled was unprecedented for us in any given event. So, it was a really big year. In terms of QuickBooks Enterprise, you are correct, in fact when you walk through total QuickBooks desktop units down 35% yet QuickBooks desktop revenue up 8%, that\u2019s really being powered by QuickBooks Enterprise. QuickBooks Enterprise Solution is a disruptor to the mid-market. It is a fast growing product in our product lineup. It\u2019s priced about 35% cheaper than any other competitors in that marketplace and we are going to continue to invest in that product. So, I fundamentally see as we said going forward desktop units overall will be down in the mid-teens, but you are going to see mid single-digit growth and that\u2019s going to be powered by QuickBooks enterprise solutions which is our upper end product for the mid-market. Matthew Wells : Thank you. Brad Smith : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, this is [indiscernible] for Siti. I just wanted to see if you could comment on QuickBooks Online for the services revenue, how the payroll and the payments are doing? Brad Smith : So I think you dropped in and out a little bit. Did you ask about how payroll and payments are doing in QuickBooks Online? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Brad Smith : Well, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of our payroll and payment business overall. Those that are attached to the QuickBooks Online platform are accelerating at fast growth rates, payroll in the 20% plus range and the payroll and payments in the plus 30% range. We continue to get stronger performance in getting the payments and payroll standalone products over on to the QBO platform. In fact, we introduced some innovations with Go Payments. As you may remember, it was a standalone mobile offering, but it was off on a different technology stack. We now had ported over, so the technology now works with QuickBooks Online. But you should hear confidence and enthusiasm coming out of our payroll and payments ecosystem. We still have more work to do, but a lot of the innovation we talked about both internally and then externally QuickBooks Connect was focused in these areas. Unidentified Analyst : It sounds good. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Your line is open. Jim MacDonald : Yes, good afternoon guys. Just following up on that last question, what are the other prospects or possibly other services or other revenue streams in the other category for QuickBooks Online in addition to payroll and payments? Brad Smith : Jim, are you referring to something on the fact sheet or are you asking theoretically are there other things we have in the pipeline beyond payroll and payments? Jim MacDonald : Right, that could be significant going forward? Brad Smith : Yes. Well, I think there is a combination. Payroll and payments have a lot of headroom. We have needed to get our execution things straightened out and I feel like we have got some run-rate there. QuickBooks Capital is one that we have talked about we are excited about as we start to really double-down on things like electronic invoicing or e-invoicing, we are seeing real benefit to customers. The innovation we introduced last week at QuickBooks Connect is it used to 33 clicks and a 48 hour approval period to get your invoice electronic enabled, P-enabled, not it\u2019s 3 clicks in 1 minute. And so if you just look at payroll and payments at QuickBooks Connect and then the third-party services with all the different acts being built on the ecosystem, we will start to see what the next opportunities might be, but right now, I would say payroll and payments and probably QuickBooks Connect will be the place that I had put my attention. Jim MacDonald : Great, thanks. And then in terms of the third quarter number of days for TurboTax, is that going to show a similar decline versus the increase in the second quarter? Brad Smith : Yes, it\u2019s a dayshift between the two quarters. Jim MacDonald : Great. Best wishes, Neil. Neil Williams : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jackson Ader : Hi, thanks guys. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. One question from our side if how should we be thinking about TurboTax Live versus the investments that you have made in SmartLook, how do those compare and contrast? Brad Smith : Yes, thanks Jack and I am glad you asked this question, because I think I contributed some confusion out there and we probably haven\u2019t been as clear. Think of SmartLook as the technology that enables TurboTax Live to happen. TurboTax Live in end-to-end value proposition, it\u2019s not only the TurboTax core product, it\u2019s an expert on the other end and it\u2019s the ability to connect through a video, a one-way video and have that sort of interchange between the customer and the expert. That interchange happens over a piece of technology we call SmartLook. So SmartLook was the code name before we got that end-to-end value proposition launch. It\u2019s really the technology that enables one-way video that the overall bundle is called TurboTax Live. Jackson Ader : Okay. I got it. Alright. That\u2019s all from us. Thank you. Brad Smith : Alright, buddy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nandan Amladi with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nandan Amladi : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So back on the comment brought about QuickBooks enterprise, as you build out the roadmap you have a new version of the API coming on QuickBooks Online. How do you balance the future roadmap with the QuickBooks enterprise relative to QuickBooks Online and that online ecosystem? Brad Smith : Yes, Nandan, thank you for the question. I would say you were going down a parallel path. We\u2019re continuing to build out the feature functionality in QuickBooks Online and as we do that we hope to ultimately have a replacement or an alternative rather for QuickBooks enterprise in the online version. That\u2019s going to take us sometime in the meantime there\u2019s real customer problems in the market that are getting solved well by current mid-market solution. And we\u2019re not abandoning the desktop, so we\u2019re continuing to make the appropriate investments in the enterprise product to make sure it got the highest net promoter score while we are making the investments, Neil talked about the strength in QBO, QuickBooks Online and an acquisition we recently did was an acquisition of the company to provide sales and use tax. And that\u2019s one of the key features that you need in an enterprise level product and so that\u2019s just an example of what we\u2019re doing to build out that functionality in QuickBooks Online. Nandan Amladi : Thank you. Brad Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I am not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith : James, I would. First of all, I want to thank everyone for the questions. I know that this is one of those weeks where we have got lot of things coming up and for those of you in the United States, the holiday. I did want to go back and thank the Lone Ranger here, Neil Williams. I often joke that over the years together, it\u2019s been like Batman and Robin and he is the one that drives the Batmobile. It\u2019s just been a real pleasure and joy to sit by him and to help navigate to this business model transition together and to learn from him and his sense of humor and his wit as you all know is unparalleled. And I am also delighted to see that not only has he left us better than he found us, but he really produced a strong leadership bench. And in that bench came Michelle and Michelle is just an outstanding individual. She is a great human being. She is an excellent financial expert. She is a great thought partner. And I believe that come February with the knowledge transfer that they have executed since August, we are really going to hit the ground running. And I will also tell you all you should rest easy, because he has taken the Batmobile keys and he has handed them to Michelle. So, once again I am not in the driver seat, I get the chance to sit in the cockpit, but there is no place I\u2019d rather be, whether it\u2019s Neil or Michelle. So, we tip our hat to you one more time my friend, you are just a good human being and great friend and we love you. And you will be forever in our Hall of Fame here. And Michelle, we can\u2019t wait for you to step into his shoes and show what you can do with the next set of dancing legs. So we are going to be ready to rock and roll. Neil\u2019s dancing legs were like mine, he tended stepped on my toes that I understand that you are going to bring a whole new level of professionalism. So that said and for everybody else and I wish you a happy and safe holiday season and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may all disconnect.",

Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brad. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: All right, thanks, Jerry, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We're midway through the fiscal year, and we are encouraged by our performance so far. Second quarter revenue grew 15% overall, fueled by 19% revenue growth in the Small Business & Self-Employed Group and 12% revenue growth in the Consumer Group. While the tax season started out slower than we expected, we remain on pace to deliver against our full-year revenue and operating income outlook. We expect our net income and our earnings per share for the full year to be above our original expectations as a result of the corporate tax legislation changes. This was reflected in our updated guidance on February 9. We'll talk more about that in a minute. But first things first, let's talk about tax. Every tax year is different, and this season is no exception. The IRS officially opened the start to the tax season on January 29, which is about a week later than last year. Even with the delayed opening, we've come out of the gate strong. The delayed opening did shift some revenue and operating income from our second fiscal quarter into our third, which led us to update our outlook for the second quarter while reaffirming our full-year revenue and operating income guidance. As a reminder, there are four key drivers behind our Consumer business. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. The third is our share within the DIY software category. And the fourth is the average revenue per return. The IRS data through February 16 shows total e-filed returns are down 1%. Self-prepared or do-it-yourself e-files grew 1%, and assisted e-files are down 4%. In comparison, TurboTax e-file returns through the same period grew 2%. While the DIY category is performing better than assisted, we are once again holding our own within the category. And product innovation is the key to our strategy. Let me share a few examples. We improved the TurboTax customer experience again this year by further automating data entry, improving the onboarding experience, and simplifying the help function by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning. TurboTax Self-Employed is a part of our lineup again this season, targeting approximately 4 million self-employed who use TurboTax. TurboTax Self-Employed also comes with a 12-month subscription to QuickBooks Self-Employed, so these customers can benefit from tracking their financials throughout the year. We also introduced TurboTax Live, leveraging one-way video technology, enabling our customers to access an expert to answer those nagging questions that erode confidence when completing a return on their own. We've built an end-to-end expert platform that enables approximately 2,000 certified public accountants and enrolled agents to serve our customers. This has opened up the nearly $20 billion assisted market to Intuit, providing an opportunity to grow our dollar share of the tax prep market while increasing our average revenue per return. Finally, we launched our new Turbo offering last month, our first step toward expanding beyond a tax offering to a consumer platform. Turbo provides customers a full view of their overall financial health by combining a credit score, verified income data, and a debt-to-income ratio to show customers where they truly stand. Customers have the option to transfer their tax data into a Turbo account when they complete their return this season. With these innovations, we expect two of the four key drivers that I mentioned earlier, do-it-yourself category growth and increased revenue per return, to propel our business this season. Now turning to small business, we delivered another strong quarter in our Small Business & Self-Employed Group. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth continued at a rapid pace and online ecosystem revenue grew 39%. We exited the quarter with over 2.8 million QuickBooks Online subscribers, a 51% increase year over year. And growth remained strong across the geographies, with U.S. subscribers growing 47% to approximately 2.2 million and international growing 69% year over year to about 630,000 subscribers. Within QuickBooks Online, Self-Employed subscribers grew to roughly 490,000. That's up from 425,000 last quarter and 180,000 one year ago. We continue to focus on delivering innovation that delights our customers and drives QBO subscriber and online ecosystem revenue growth. Let me share a few examples. We're putting more money in our customers' pockets and providing access to capital for small businesses. Today, only 20% of small businesses have access to the funding that they need to grow. We're leveraging our innovative model to enable small businesses to use the QuickBooks data to get full credit for their business performance and gain access to much-needed capital. We're also harnessing the power of data so that our customers experience little to no work when using our products. For example, we're automating expense categorization, and we're putting a voice-driven virtual assistant in the palm of their hand. Finally, we're helping our customers make decisions with complete confidence by matching them with an accountant and by making it easier to onboard workers, whether those workers are employees or contractors. These and other innovations have enabled us to achieve a global QBO Net Promoter Score that is 10 points higher on average when compared to the next best alternative in the market. Following our playbook, which is grounded in this evidence of a strong product market fit, we have now leaned into marketing and launched a new brand campaign, QuickBooks Backing You. We're encouraged by the early data we're seeing with respect to the campaign's impacts on both QuickBooks brand awareness and driving more prospective customers to our website. We also completed three acquisitions this quarter, aligned with our merger and acquisition strategy to pursue opportunities that enhance product functionality and grow our employee talent pool. The largest of these is a time tracking solution called TSheets, which has been one of the most popular apps on Intuit's open platform. Our long-term partnership over more than seven years gave us a front row seat to see how TSheets was addressing customers' pain points, so the transaction was a natural evolution of our relationship. Moving on to the Strategic Partner Group, our professional tax revenue was in line with our expectations for the quarter. We continue to focus on multiservice accounting firms that do both books and taxes. This is a service to driving our accountants' success while growing our small business ecosystem. Now before I close, I want to talk about how we're applying our philosophy and our principles to the benefits from the new corporate tax legislation. Our philosophy is to build our business for both the short and the long term. To do that, we invest in talent to deliver for customers and to achieve our strategic priorities while applying our financial principles to assess which investments are best to make. When we look at where we are today, we believe our fiscal year 2018 operating plan already includes the right mix of investments in employees, technology, and product development to benefit our customers. Therefore, as a result of the lower tax rate for fiscal year 2018, we increased our GAAP earnings per share guidance by $0.20, and we increased our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance by $0.40. We'll continue to assess investment opportunities when we engage in our long-term planning this summer and as we create our game plan for fiscal year 2019 and beyond. So putting a bow around the quarter, it's halftime in fiscal year 2018. We remain on a strong path. We're pleased with the continued momentum of our Small Business & Self-Employed Group, and we remain laser-focused on executing with excellence as we sprint towards the April 17 tax filing deadline. And with that overview, let me hand it over to Michelle to walk you through the financial details. Michelle, it is awesome to have you on the call. Michelle Clatterbuck - Intuit, Inc.: Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we delivered revenue of $1.2 billion, up 15% year over year; GAAP operating income of $20 million, versus $22 million a year ago; non-GAAP operating income of $120 million, versus $106 million last year; GAAP loss per share of $0.08, versus diluted earnings per share of $0.05 last year. This GAAP loss reflects a $39 million tax charge related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets, as described in our press release. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.35, up from $0.26 last year. Consumer Group revenue was $334 million for the second quarter. Brad has already walked you through our analysis of the season so far. TurboTax e-filed returns grew 2% through February 16, outperforming e-files in the DIY category, which grew 1% in the same period. We remain confident in our overall plans for the year and for Consumer revenue to grow 7% to 9% in fiscal 2018. Strategic Partner Group reported $95 million of professional tax revenue for the second quarter. We continue to expect revenue in this business to grow 0% to 2% in fiscal 2018. Total Small Business & Self-Employed revenue grew 19% in the quarter. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth remained strong at 51%, ending the quarter with 2.8 million subscribers. Online ecosystem revenue accelerated to grow 39% in the second quarter, up from 35% in the first quarter. Online accounting continues to drive this revenue growth. As we said last quarter, we expect year-over-year QuickBooks Online subscriber growth to slow in the second half of the year, following the introduction of the Self-Employed bundle last tax season. We remain confident in our outlook for growth in QuickBooks Online subscribers, as reflected in our fiscal 2018 guidance of 3.275 million to 3.375 million subscribers. We also continue to expect Online ecosystem revenue to grow better than 30%. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 9% in the quarter, driven by QuickBooks Enterprise strength. QuickBooks Desktop units fell 15%. For fiscal 2018, we expect QuickBooks Desktop units to decline mid-teens and Desktop ecosystem revenue to be up mid-single digits. As Brad mentioned, when considering how to leverage the benefits from tax legislation changes, we apply our philosophy of building our business for both the short and long term and then follow our financial principles. As a reminder, we updated our fiscal year 2018 guidance earlier this month, based upon these principles flowing through the benefits of tax legislation changes. Our guidance includes GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.30, an increase of 13% to 16%. This is based on a GAAP tax rate of 26% and reflects the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets discussed earlier. Our guidance also includes non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.30 to $5.40, an increase of 20% to 22%. This is based on a non-GAAP tax rate of 27%. Beyond fiscal year 2018, we estimate our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be roughly 23%. We'll continue to apply our financial principles going forward, as we take a disciplined approach to capital management. As a reminder, those principles are, investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth, targeting opportunities returning 15% or more over five years; using acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap; and returning cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We'll continue to assess investment opportunities as we revisit our long-term plan this summer. We finished the quarter with $726 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $83 million of shares in the second quarter. Approximately $1.3 billion remains on our authorization. We completed three acquisitions with cash and other consideration totaling approximately $400 million. The board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share payable April 18, 2018, an increase of 15% over last year. Our third quarter fiscal 2018 guidance includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.32 to $4.37, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.57 to $4.62. You can find our Q3 and fiscal 2018 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Brad, to close. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thank you, Michelle. As we shared with all of you at Investor Day in September, we've entered the next chapter of our company's evolution, in service to our new mission of powering prosperity around the world. This chapter is being driven by our One Intuit ecosystem strategy that unlocks the power of the many for the prosperity of each and every one of our individuals who are participating on our platform. Said another way, our assets and our customers are stronger when working together than they are apart. In support of this ecosystem strategy, we launched our first ever Intuit brand campaign, which debuted just a few weeks ago. The early results have exceeded our expectations. If you haven't been introduced to the Intuit Giant, it's a metaphor for how Intuit's ecosystem unlocks the power of many for the prosperity of one, helping our customers rise to new heights through the combined power of TurboTax, QuickBooks, and Mint, and I encourage you to check it out on YouTube if you get a minute. With that, we're pleased with our results through the first half, but we still have plenty of time left on the clock as we enter the back half of the fiscal year, so we remain focused on execution until that final whistle blows. That's it for our opening comments, and now let's open it up to you to hear what's on your mind. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff of Credit Suisse. Your line is open Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. Brad, would you mind giving us maybe some hard data around the TurboTax Live offering and how that's tracking versus your expectations, and whether you need to maybe tweak the go-to-market strategy, the pricing of the product, or the marketing around it? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. First of all, we're very encouraged, although it's still early days for TurboTax Live. As you know, it tends to be more simple filers in the early part of the season and then those who get a little more complicated towards the back half. But so far, coming out of the gate, we're delighted with the customer feedback on TurboTax Live as well as the experts that are actually manning the platform and answering the questions. And in terms of any adjustments in go-to-market, we have multiple tests running at the same time. But so far, there is no need to pivot. We actually like what we're seeing, and we're looking forward to the back half of the season. Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great, thanks very much. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC, your question, please. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks. Brad, actually two, if I can. Just following-on on that TurboTax Live, I think this year you said that it probably is going to be more aimed at mitigating some their churn you see from folks that have life events or other reasons that they would move off from TurboTax. I was just curious as to when you think about that opportunity, I think it's 3 million churn off a year. Can you maybe parameterize what would be a good result in terms of keeping would-be churners through TurboTax Live? Do you have any views on how you would view a good event versus a bad event? And then I had one follow-up. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Ross. So let me tackle the first one. You're right, the strategic context for why we launched TurboTax Live has two parts. The first is we lose about 3 million customers a year to an assisted method, and it's primarily because they had a question where they lost confidence and felt like they needed to go to someone who could help them through it. The second opportunity and perhaps the bigger is there are tens of millions of people who go to an assisted tax prep method today who also have one simple nagging question that, if they knew they had access to an expert, they would be willing to file their taxes basically with a self-prepared product like ours. So if you step back, the first part of your question, which is retention, we would look at the retention improvement. And we would ask ourselves, are we retaining more customers than we were in the prior year now that we have TurboTax Live? Are we stopping some of the 3 million from leaving? The other one which you'll look at is as we look at growing new users, how many of those users came from an assisted tax prep method last year. And those are really the two primary drivers we're looking at in terms of growth. Of course, we look at Net Promoter for both the tax filer and the pro to see if the quality of the experience is where it needs to be. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets : Great, that's helpful. And then maybe just a quick one on the Self-Employed net adds. It's slightly down year over year, but I assume there's some impact from TurboTax Self-Employed and the fact that the tax season has got off to a later start. So does that imply a similar pattern that we would see a little bit of that seasonality more pronounced in Q3 for the Self-Employed adds this year? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: First of all, we're excited about Self-Employed. As you know, we've been expanding it into new markets. 490,000 subs this year versus 180,000 a year ago is some pretty strong growth. We have been trying to set expectations that we're now starting to grow over last year's introduction to this big TurboTax Channel as well as the fact that we're really starting to get our sea legs on the offering itself. So we're growing over some strong numbers. That does not diminish our belief that the Self-Employed product is going to be a real growth driver in the future. But I do believe you're going to start to get some tough compares. And your point is a very strong hypothesis. The fact that we're opening up a week later and yet growing over some numbers from last year in Self-Employed could be part of what you see in terms of slowing down that growth rate a little bit. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets : Great. Thanks a lot, Brad. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thank you, Ross. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks, similar question, Brad, on the Self-Employed. I'm wondering if you could talk about \u2013 I think you're probably starting to renew some of those folks that signed on a year ago with TaxAttack. Can you talk about what you're seeing there? And then I had a follow-up as well for Michelle. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Sure, Walter. It's still fairly early because that subscription from last year runs through April 30. However, we have leading indicators and cohort analysis that tells us that our aspirations for retention are being met and quite frankly, slightly exceed it at this point. But we'll know more as we get through the rest of the tax season. So we'll share some of that data once we get through tax season and go into Investor Day. But right now, it is a green light from our perspective. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then for Michelle, just on cash flow, you note the increase in the earnings range for the year based on tax. I know you don't guide cash flow. But would it be fair to say we would see a commensurate increase in cash flow based on what's happening on the tax side, or is it not really a cash impact, more of a P&L impact for the year? Michelle Clatterbuck - Intuit, Inc.: You are exactly right. You're right, we don't actually guide that. But that's right, it does make sense that you would see an increase there on the cash flow side. It's not just the P&L. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC : Hi, Brad. Anything new competitively that you're sensing and feel that maybe you haven't seen historically? I'm just curious if you could give us \u2013 I know it's really early, but any changes this year that you're detecting. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yes, Brent. First of all, the competition, as we always say, we have a lot of respect for them. They have great leaders, good products, strong brands, and everyone is continuing to innovate and trying to reimagine how to help these customers file taxes in a frictionless way. And so every year is a little different. We're seeing fresh advertising campaigns. We're seeing changes to products. We're seeing people start to move into this hybrid between do-it-yourself and having an expert, and it really comes down to who does that the best and has the highest quality product experience. But to be frank with you, we have hypothesized that that would be the actions others would be taking, and of course, we've been moving that path as well. And so there really hasn't been a massive gosh, we didn't see that coming. But that's not to take away from our competition. They're doing a good job, and we have to stay on our toes and continue to do better. Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC : And on the M&A side, three acquisitions for you in the quarter. You haven't really been known as an acquisition machine, and that is a step up as it relates to what you've been doing. Is this a change in tone from your direction going forward in how you're thinking about doing deals, or does this just happen to be in one quarter and these are smaller tuck-ins and we shouldn't really read into this? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: I think it's the latter, Brent. We've always said that we would look at organic and inorganic opportunities, whether they're strategic partnerships like we work with Stripe or other companies or they would be acquisitions like the three we did this quarter. We have learned some lessons from our scar tissue. The best acquisitions we can do either bring talent in that we need, like data scientists and designers and mobile engineers, or they fill out a feature gap that we have in one of our core products that accelerates our time to market. And the three acquisitions we did this quarter did both of those things. And the neat thing about it is as a platform now, we've learned that we don't have to do a spreadsheet to decide if it will be successful. We can actually look at how well the partnership has worked in the market, and that derisks the acquisition, and that's what we did with TSheets. We actually studied them for seven years, and we were a partner with them for a pretty long time. So I think we have a more informed M&A strategy. But I wouldn't look at three in a quarter as being a predictor for how aggressive we're going to be with acquisitions. I think we're just going to continue to take advantage of opportunities when they pop up. Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, your question, please. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thank you very much. Congratulations, Michelle, on your first investor call. Brad, congrats on the quarter and the outlook. I would like to just ask you a question in regards to TurboTax Live. What is the longer-term play here? Is this potentially something that could disrupt the bricks-and-mortar because I certainly cannot imagine \u2013 I've got two young children. I cannot imagine my 11-year-old going to a tax store to do his taxes when he's able to do it \u2013 I would presume the whole world is going virtual in many aspects of how we do business and even our personal lives. So what is the longer-term play here? What are you going for? Is this a home run kind of an opportunity for Intuit, or is this something that you're going to slowly and incrementally improvise, improvise, and improvise and see how this thing goes with respect to the broader ambition of Intuit's unlocking the broader tax prep market and making it really DIY or assisted/assistant? Thank you. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thank you, Kash, and thank you for calling out Michelle being on the call. It's great to have her. And she and Neil [Williams] did a wonderful job in the transition. It has truly been seamless inside the company. You really hit the high points there. TurboTax Live we believe has the potential to be transformational. It's happening across multiple industries, where you provide a platform that reduces friction between the interaction of different parties. And we have tax professionals who are looking for the chance to have many more prospects to serve, and we're looking for many people who are looking for access to an expert if and when they need it, and making that a more flexible option as opposed to a binary decision. In the past you had to say I'm going to an expert or I'm going to try and do it myself. Now you can actually get into the platform and you can go as far as you need to. And then if you need a little help, you can have an expert at the click of a button. And if you want, an expert can eventually take over the return if you just don't want to have to bother with it. So I think this is going to be a fundamental potential game-changer. And then the question is going to be how are we going to go after it. We went after it pretty aggressively this year. We took last year's SmartLook technology and this year we scaled the platform with over 2,000 experts. I think we're going to get a ton of learning this year, and that learning will inform how much more aggressive we would go after it in the coming years. But I would suffice it to say we think we're on something here. We like the results, and we're just going to continue to lean in, and we'll learn as we go. Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Fantastic, thank you very much. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thank you, take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, everyone, and good afternoon. Brad, just curious your thoughts on the late start again to the tax season. Do you think it's PATH [Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act]? Do you think it has something to do with uncertainty around tax reform and customer mindsets? I was just curious on the behavioral view there. Thanks. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: I would say, Scott, to a large extent, it was just the fact that the gates weren't open until six days later. We've seen a pretty strong volume uptick. As you could see, the IRS has gone from their first numbers now down just 1%. And of course, we've been picking up steam too. And right now we're in an e-file perspective up about 2 points. And that's above the category and the overall number of returns. And I think that momentum has continued to pick up. I think last year was a learning curve that most people got behind then on the PATH Act. So I think this is really primarily just the fact that the season got opened up about a week later than last year. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks for that. And then there were some rate increases in Deluxe and Premier this year online. I know you're probably not going to share too much. But with each of the tiers that you offer, are you happy? Anything surprising? Do you like the retention levels? Anything good, bad, or otherwise, specifically by tiers in TurboTax this year? Thanks. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Scott. So far, so good. We had a game plan that we mapped out in August. We ran some scenarios through third peak, which is October for those that don't speak tax lingo. It's those last filers. And we went into this year with some choices we made, where we were able to price for value, where we felt like we had untapped value in the product. And in other places, we went more aggressive in free, which you've seen with some of our TV ads and our digital ads. And we like how the season is playing out. So there isn't anything that I would say is a warning flag for us. So far, if we just keep executing, we're feeling pretty good about the season. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks a lot. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Holt of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Adam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi, everyone. And, Michelle, I'll echo the congrats and the welcome. I had two questions, one for Brad and one for Michelle. Brad, for you, if we look at the tax business in the quarter, obviously units were weaker. But you were still able to grow 12%, which by my quick math would suggest that average selling prices were up quite a bit year on year, possibly even as much as 20%. Could you talk a little bit about what was behind that, given your comments earlier about the complexity this season really accruing to the back end? How are ASPs so good, and what does that portend for the rest of the season? And then one for you, Michelle. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Adam. First of all, as I had mentioned in my opening comments, we feel this year's drivers will be primarily category growth, which will grow the pie of customers and our opportunity to try to grow share. And then the second is going to be average revenue per return. And average revenue per return is going to be a factor of a few things. How many of prior-year paid customers did we win back? So did we retain those customers that we might have lost to unassisted by having something like TurboTax Live, so we retain paying customers. The second, did we win paying customers from others? And then the third is do they move up our product lineup, up to and including TurboTax Live, which you know is somewhere between $150 and $180 in terms of the revenue per return? So it's that factor right now that's driving our strong revenue growth. And I know when we gave guidance this year and we talked about 7% to 9%, there was some worry about do we have enough gas in the tank to do that, given last year's unit growth? We believe we do. That's why we reaffirmed our guidance. We think that right now, because we have a healthy mix of paid customers, we have a good product lineup in the upper end of our product SKUs, and we also have TurboTax Live that we can continue to sustain strong revenue per return growth. And we're going to also continue to go aggressively after customers. Adam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC : That's terrific. And then for Michelle, if I look at the Q3 operating income and earnings guidance, you made the comment that you had some operating income that shift from Q2 into Q3, which should be additive. But it looks like you're actually guiding operating margins down on a year-on-year basis. Can you reconcile those two elements? And maybe walk us through the guide for Q3 on the operating income side? Michelle Clatterbuck - Intuit, Inc.: Adam, thanks for the question. To put it shortly, I wouldn't get too wrapped up around the quarter. It really is \u2013 yes, we have had some revenue in the tax business that shifted from Q2 to Q3. Of course then not all the costs shift from Q2 to Q3. Some of those remained in Q2. And so I really wouldn't get too concerned about the various quarters. I'd focus on the full year. And we feel very confident in the full-year guide that has been reaffirmed for this year. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yeah. And, Adam, I'll just put a fine point on what Michelle said, because it really is seasonal shifts. And I will tell you, we've been tracking. Some have been a little overly aggressive in how much they thought would shift from Q2 to Q3. Others might have been a little conservative. And I'd say we're in the sweet spot in the middle there. But if you look at the full year, our game plan is to continue to deliver that revenue and operating income that we guided when we set out the year and we reaffirmed again at Investor Day. And that includes a little bit of operating leverage, a little bit of margin expansion. Now we said we're going for operating dollar growth, not margin growth. But with that, we do see a little chance here to continue to get a little operating leverage. So that quarter-to-quarter shift is going to be optically a little misleading. So back to Michelle's point, focusing on the full year is probably the best thing we could have everybody do right now. Adam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC : Okay, thank you. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent, thank you, guys, for taking the question and nice quarter. Digging in on the margins a little bit, this is the first year of really having a big effort behind TurboTax Live. Is there any appreciable impact on margins that we should be thinking about into Q3 as you ramp up that effort? And the second question on margins is with the recent M&A, I'm assuming that it's probably pretty small revenues and probably not really material. Is there any materiality in terms of the expense that we're adding into the equation with that M&A? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, Keith. I'll start with the TurboTax Live margins. And say, no, there isn't going to be a meaningful impact. Couple reasons, one is we manage margin at the company level. And we ask the business leaders to focus on LTV-to-CAC. And then the second is, as you know, we talk about growing our operating income dollars mid-teens. And we often joke inside the company that we take dollars to the bank, not percentages. So with that being said, TurboTax Live is a higher revenue per return product. And we have a pretty efficient platform we've been able to put out there that hosts over 2,000 experts. So at $150 to $180 and then with the pricing model we have with those experts, we do not see this as being margin dilutive to an extent where it's going to bring the overall margin of the business or the company down. So that's TurboTax Live. In terms of M&A, two of those three acquisitions were really acqui-hires. They were going after talent. And so we were able to get to them efficiently, and what that does is that offsets a recruiting process where we have to go at them one at a time. So that's a really efficient thing, and it wasn't big dollars. And then basically, what we're getting with the TSheets is there is a slight dilutive effect in terms of how much revenue will hit this particular year because it's a stub year versus the expense, but it's not enough us to have adjusted our guidance. So we've baked all that into the guidance we've given you for the year. Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent, thank you guys very much. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan: Thanks. Hi, guys, just one from my side. You talked about in terms of the QBO sub growth. You reiterated the idea of slowing here in the second half as we lap the Self-Employed. I'm just curious. If you back out the Self-Employed units and just look at the rest of the QBO units, how should we think about the growth dynamics or the growth trends in the rest of that QBO base moving forward? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Sterling, we see them continuing at this point up and to the right. I say that with facts behind it. Our Net Promoter Scores, I have been incredibly excited and impressed with the team as they continue to get at the most nagging problems getting in customers' ways, and they're making improvements to the product. And this Net Promoter Score now on average is a 10-point advantage over the competitors in each of the markets. We have some markets that we're not completely where we want to be, but other markets we are far ahead of a 10-point advantage. And that gave us enough confidence to lean into a pretty aggressive advertising and marketing campaign, which is really propelling the number of prospects that are coming into the product. So we see QBO core without Self-Employed continuing to grow at an accelerating rate, and then Self-Employed for us is just a greenfield opportunity that's just icing on the cake. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan: So that growth rate has actually tailed a little bit. So you think it will reaccelerate from these levels? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You know what we have right now. The answer is yes. And there are reasons to believe both in terms of the quality of the product and the go-to-market starting to kick in, which we started back in the fall. As you might imagine, we're getting a little smarter in some of these markets outside the U.S. where we were waiting for product market fit to kick in. And so I think as you look about \u2013 and we talk about this business not in the next 90 days, because we're we looking at it and looking the next several years, we do see opportunity to continue to accelerate core QBO. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan: Great, thank you. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jesse Hulsing of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Brad, historically you've talked about unit growth being the most important thing for your tax business. But this year, it seems like there's a lot of ARPU levers, and a lot of what you're doing on the product side is moving up market. Is that strategy shifting? Is this becoming more of a move up market, ARPU-driven business over the next few years, or is the way that you think about this business still very focused on underlying unit growth? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Jesse, it's an insightful question, and the answer is it's an 'and'. We still have a priority that says we want to expand the number of people who have confidence in themselves to file taxes on their own. So that's expand the do-it-yourself category. And in doing that, we want to win our fair share of those, which is customer and unit growth. But the other thing is we admitted that we've been a little myopic. There's $20 billion worth of spend in the assisted tax prep method. And we believe now with a platform that has 2,000 experts answering questions, we can also go after share of dollars, not just share of market. Now, as you might imagine, when you're in a multiyear strategy, in one given year you may lean more into one area than the other. And so we're fighting right now a very competitive free market while we're trying to go out and disrupt what we think to be a pretty vulnerable assisted market. And so you're starting to see a little more ARPU come in, but that has not changed our strategy, which is we think customer growth continues to be the lifeblood long term. But we think we can do that and grow ARPU at the same time. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then a quick follow-up, if I may. Turbo, the new Consumer platform, how has conversion been into that product from early TurboTax filers? Thanks. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: I think your operative word there is early. We still have a lot of season to play, but I will share this. We have been very excited, as have our partners who are already working on the Turbo platform, whether it's ask Marcus or it's Quicken Loans or some of the other partners out there, and we've been in conversations with them. The quality of the product, the number of people who are opting into the product, and the people who are clicking to transfer data after they've completed their tax return is so far ahead. Right now, it is ahead of the expectations we had, and we're still learning as we go. So right now, I would say it's early days, which is what you referred to. We'll have a better read at the end of the season, but we like the leading indicators. Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks, Brad. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI : Thanks very much. Brad, I just had one question just on international QBO subscribers. At the Analyst Day, you talked about you're seeing the right type of CAC rates for a lot of these different geographies that you're going after. I was wondering if you can just give us a little bit of an update on how that's going in terms of the cost of going after these subs. And then I was wondering if there's any real difference now that that business has gotten a little bit more critical mass just in terms of the renewal rates on the international base maybe versus the domestic. Thanks. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yes, Kirk. So we haven't broken down our LTV-to-CAC beyond what we shared at Investor Day. So I can give you a qualitative and then we'll once again use that annual opportunity to give you an update on the numbers. But our numbers are still blending at around 6.9 for desktop in the U.S. for QuickBooks. And then QBO in the U.S. of 5.5. And if you blend in the global market, it's 4.5. So our LTV-to-CAC is still very healthy, all blended, all in at 4.5. Each of the individual countries have an individual target depending upon where they are in their maturity curve. Countries that are closer to the U.S., like you may think Canada, have a higher CAC target \u2013 or a lower CAC target, a higher LTV-to-CAC ratio than some of these other countries like France and India, where we're in the early days of trying to build the brand to get the product in market. So we haven't broken out that level of detail. I can tell you this. When you see us lean in and a start to do TV campaigns in markets, which we've done in countries like Australia, the UK, and Canada, that should be a signal that we like the LTV-to-CAC and we're going to continue to invest in marketing. When you don't see us doing that, and I can give you those countries, Brazil, France, and India, that's because we don't feel we have that number where we want it to be yet. We want the product to do more of the work right now. Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI : Great, thanks very much. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research, your question, please. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Hi. Talking again about TurboTax Live, can you give us some quantification as to \u2013 I'm sure you could. Would you give us some quantification as to what you're seeing in terms of retaining those 3 million customers and picking up from the assisted? Secondly, just so we have some better grasp of how fast things are improving in the market, tell us what your increase or your change in the latest week was. And thirdly, could you talk about RAs? Is this the first year you're doing them? How many have you done this year? What does it cost you to do them, and anything else? And why haven't you gone up to where the market is? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thank you, Michael. I love each quarter the questions you ask. And I appreciate that you try to go for the things that we sometimes can't reveal, but it's always worth asking. So let me start with TurboTax Live, and I'll say what I said a few minutes ago. We are very encouraged, although it's still early in the season. The more complex returns will be filed later in the season. But right now, I can tell you on a cohort basis, we like the trajectory of our retention number, so that I'll just share. The second thing I would say is our new user growth looks strong. And our sources of new users, which include those who were filing last year in an assisted method, is also encouraging. We'll unpack those numbers with much more definitive detail at Investor Day, which is what we always do. That will give you a little bit of a sneak peek there with just talking in broad terms. In terms of last week, can't do that. I want to keep it on an apples-to-apples basis, and this is the second quarter update. We did move the numbers up through February 16 because since the IRS had reported through there, we wanted to at least give you a couple weeks in February. But I really don't want to get into sharing things beyond that. There are a lot of other people who listen to these calls beyond just you and me, and I want to try to keep that powder dry. And then the last piece is the Refund Advance, or what had been known in years past as refund anticipation loans, what's really happened here is for a lot of years, as you know, we chose not to be in that category because we felt like it was usury rates, and it was taking advantage of customers. And over the years, a lot of the industry abandoned it as well. The government frowned on it, and we didn't want to be a part of that. What's happened now is a couple of things. One is with changes in legislation and delays in people like Earned Income Tax filers for the Earned Income Tax Credit having to wait till later in the season to get a check, there's an opportunity for us to come back in and in a very consumer-friendly way help those people get access to money. And it's a partial loan to bridge them over until they get the tax refund. Now what you see us having in market is we're testing various levels, $250 partial loan, $500, $750, and $1,000, and it is zero interest, no fees. So there are no usurious rates out there. We make our money only on the interchange fees on the card, and the customer doesn't pay that. And we're running it right now as a test. And because it still aligns with our principles, and we'll see how it works this year, and then we'll decide if its something we want to go after bigger in future years. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : I actually meant what does it cost you \u2013 not what it costs \u2013 I know it doesn't cost \u2013 you don't charge the consumer. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: That information I wouldn't want to share right now because we've got other people who are offering the same thing, and I want to make sure that we keep our cost structure competitive. But I appreciate you asking the question. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : And can you be competitive in a five to 10-day wait compared to 24 hours? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Are you talking about what we have in the market right now compared to others? Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Yes. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: We fully believe that what matters most to the customers we're going to make sure we're competitive on. And sometimes features may not or may not be important, but we certainly do know getting access to money in a timely fashion is. And so that's why this year we're running tests and experiments to see what are the most important things for customers. But I can promise you if that's the most important thing, we won't roll a product out if we can't be competitive. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Great, thank you. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question, two questions. First, Brad, a lot of my questions were answered. But can you talk a little bit about the Desktop business, where you're running on revenue at a very healthy clip? And obviously, units are suffering a little bit. How sustainable is that momentum that you see there? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yes, Raimo. So we have anticipated for some time now that we're going to see mid-teens decline in units on Desktop, as we see more customers who come into the franchise opt for the cloud. In fact, eight out of 10 now choose QBO over Desktop. And then we also have some customers on Desktop that are moving to the subscription version of Desktop. In fact, that grew about 8% this quarter. So when you put in Desktop sold through retail and then blend that with those who bought a Desktop subscription, the combined numbers were down just about 1%, so roughly flat. And we believe that's going to be sustainable. What's driving the revenue is those that are staying on Desktop tend to have more feature functionality, they tend to have more attached services like payroll and payment. And many are QuickBooks Enterprise. And QuickBooks Enterprise is growing and continuing to grow. And so that's bringing the overall revenue per customer up. And that's why you're going to see mid to high single-digit growth. even with a 15-point decline in units. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. And quick question for Michelle. In the last few quarters, we were talking about the high investment levels as you change over the platform, move over to AWS, and use the different opportunities to invest more into the business. Where are you in terms of \u2013 after being in the seat now for a little bit, where are you in terms of like pushing on with these investments? And is there any change coming from you? Thank you. Michelle Clatterbuck - Intuit, Inc.: You're right. We have over this last year, specifically, we've talked about how we have focused on really freeing up some of our spend. We said about 10%, to then take that to reinvest it and focus in four key areas, one of which, as you mentioned, is transitioning to AWS. We're also reallocating funds into artificial intelligence and machine learning, into our engineering team overall, and into our Intuit brand campaign, which you've seen. From my standpoint, those continue to be \u2013 and for the company continue to be some of the strategic priority focus areas for us. And so we're going to continue to increase \u2013 or have that spend reallocated over this year. And then as we go into the summer, we'll go through our planning process, where we always look at what our top priorities are for spending. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect, thank you, well done. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Hello? Operator : Mr. Panigrahi, your line is open. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Can you hear me? Operator : Yes. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yes, we can now. Yes. Michelle Clatterbuck - Intuit, Inc.: We can now. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, sorry. Yeah. Just going back to the payroll and payment, I know you guys stopped giving the attach rate. But just wanted to understand the trends you are seeing on the payroll and payment to QBO business. And how strategic those two business? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yeah. We believe both of those businesses are strategic. They're important problems that small businesses need to have solved in a simple and elegant way. And we continue to like the fact that we're seeing online ecosystem revenue in aggregate grow from 35% last quarter to 39% this quarter. And of course, in there is not only the accounting, but also the payroll and the payment numbers. Now we would tell you that we remain focused on trying to accelerate those results. There's lots of things our teams are working on inside. But there is no new news in terms of payroll and payments besides what we shared with you in the fall. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And just asking on the Turbo Capital (sic) [QuickBooks Capital] (53:29) that you guys launched last year, is there any update or anything that you have seen, initial response from your customer base? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: It continues to be a forward momentum business. In fact, we're spending time in the upcoming board meeting in May talking about the exciting lessons we've learned so far. The thing that gets us most encouraged is those that are getting loans through QuickBooks Capital, 60% of them were considered unlendable by other financial lenders up till this point. So we're going after a category and a market that isn't being served well. And we like the economics of the business. So right now, nothing that we would reveal that's more specific than that, other than you ought to hear a general tone. And I believe that we think this is a real opportunity that we'll continue to lean into. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for the color. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks very much. Brad, the Online ecosystem showed a pretty significant sequential acceleration on a much harder comp year over year. Can you maybe dig into what was driving that? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yeah. I would say, Brad, there's two things driving it. One is, as we continue to improve the quality of the product, then we're able to back off in some of the non-U.S. markets on super-aggressive discounts and promotions. I would tell you upfront that our teams and we leaned into that early on to get customers on the platform. And as we've improved the product, we found it less important to do that. So I think we're getting a little wiser in our discounting. And then the second thing I would say is we're building out the ecosystem. So we're getting healthier ecosystem results. Our payments results, I'm very excited about. Our teams continue to lean in there. Payroll, we're continuing to push ahead and we're getting learnings every day. And so I think it's the aggregate of those three things that are helping us drive ecosystem revenue. Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks very much. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis, your question, please. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Yeah, guys. I just want to follow up on that last one. And you're now at 39% Online growth. You're talking about over 30%. Should we expect you to raise your long-term view for Online growth? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Thanks, Jim. You sound like me when I sit with our teams, and they tell me the exciting results, and I want to raise their quota. Honestly, what we've tried to do right now is we've tried to peg a multiyear objective that is both aggressive but also something that we think we can sustain for more than a couple of quarters. And so right now, what I think is most important is that we keep the team focused on 40% subscriber growth and 30% ecosystem revenue growth. That produces an incredibly healthy business and a very strong opportunity for the company to continue to grow at the rates we talked about. Now if we see a continuing trend that is way above that 30% and we think that's sustainable, then we will certainly both have that conversation inside and then talk to you about it at an event. But right now, I don't think this one quarter growing 35% to 39% is enough for us to say let's raise our long-term outlook. But it certainly is encouraging and we like it and we're going to continue to lean in and see how far we can push it. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Great. And my follow-up is on TSheets, any thoughts you can give us on how you plan to run that business differently at all or what you plan \u2013 and any plans for TSheets now that you own them? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Yes, thanks. You know TSheets and the accounting profession knows them well out there too, is they are a great company. They have a world-class leader in Matt Rissell. And they have a top-performing Best Place to Work in their home state. And they have really high Net Promoter Scores with accountants and with business owners. Right now, our game plan is to do no harm in terms of their culture and to look for ways where we can accelerate their growth by having them actually get access to our large customer base as well as some of our infrastructure. So we have a very thoughtful integration plan. We have learned over the years that we can bear hug you and squeeze all the entrepreneurial spirit out of you, which is not good. And we've also left islands out there with absolutely no integration, and that hasn't been helpful either. So we've got a hybrid approach and I really like how the team is approaching it. But right now, we like that business. They're on a good trajectory and they've got a great leadership team. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Great, thanks. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Your line in open. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thank you, really a quick one for me. Looking at the QuickBooks Online revenue relative to average subscribers in the quarter, it looks like that metric, the implied average price per subscriber was probably the best we've seen in a number of quarters now. And obviously, you saw a lot of strength in Self-Employed and International, which tends to be lower ASP. So I'm just curious what the dynamic is there, why it looked a little bit better this quarter on the pricing front and whether that's something we should see as more sustainable or more of a one-quarter phenomenon. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Jen, I would say that the numbers we want to continue to reinforce are the 40% subscriber growth and the north of 30% on ecosystem revenue. And then that ARPU number is going to move up and down in particular in any given quarter based upon mix. Self-Employed, core QBO U.S., QBO non-U.S,, now we're getting a little wiser on discounting strategies outside the U.S. and a few markets where we're seeing strong product market fit. And I think what you're seeing this quarter is just a healthier mix of core QBO, Self-Employed still growing, but we're also getting wiser with the discounting strategy. And I think it's just giving you the thought that that's looking good. I will tell you the trend line, I think the teams are doing a really good job of getting after LTV-to-CAC. And if we can improve that for every cohort, over time the ARPUs will move in a good direction. But right now, I think this is just an optic of what happened in the last 90 days and what the mix of customers were. Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad D. Smith - Intuit, Inc.: Sure, Latif. I'll keep it short. I want to thank everybody for your questions. We learn a lot from the things that are on your minds and we're looking forward to engaging with you in the after-hour calls as well as coming out and seeing you in conferences in the coming weeks. I'll just say we feel like we've got the strong momentum as we enter the second half At the same time, we've been in the business long enough to know there's plenty of time left on the clock, so we're going to have to stay focused on execution. I really appreciate several of you calling out how good it is to have Michelle in her role full time. It's been a wonderful transition, and we're looking forward to the future with her. And with that, we'll speak with you soon. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

My name is Latif and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Jerry Natoli : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. I am here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2017 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I will turn the call over to Brad. Brad Smith : Thanks, Jerry and thanks to all of you for joining us. We delivered very strong results in our third fiscal quarter, with overall revenue growth of 15%, fueled by 15% growth in the Consumer Group and 16% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. Because of this strength and the continued momentum across the company, we are raising our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2018. With that headline, let me share some observations on our business overall and I will start with tax and our consumer business. Heading into tax season, we foreshadowed that this year\u2019s primary drivers of revenue would be do-it-yourself category growth and higher average revenue per return. That\u2019s indeed how the season played out, producing very strong results. As we have communicated over the years, there are four primary drivers in our Consumer business. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS and the latest IRS data indicates total returns grew about 1% in line with our expectations. The second is the percentage of those returns that were filed using do-it-yourself software. As a reminder, the DIY category growth is our largest lever of revenue growth. To-date, the DIY category share has grown just over 0.5 point, again outpacing the assisted tax prep category. As the leader, we view it as our responsibility to help drive category awareness and growth. So, we are pleased with this result. The third is our share within DIY. We competed well and earned a modest increase in our share of the category this season. When you look beyond DIY to total returns, we also gained 0.5 point of total market share. The fourth is the average revenue per return, which increased quite nicely this season. The growth was driven by a combination of attach, mix shift to the higher end of our product line, which includes TurboTax Live and pricing for value. Bottom line, it was a successful tax season. As we shared at Investor Day last fall, in addition to extending our lead in DIY, we are increasingly focused on transforming assisted tax prep and expanding our business beyond tax. We made encouraging progress behind each of these strategic priorities this season. In support of transforming assisted tax prep, we are pleased with the results of our TurboTax Live offering in its first season. We delivered an innovative experience that enabled filers who are seeking more confidence in their personal tax situation to do so by accessing a tax pro with the touch of a screen. Feedback from the nearly 2,000 pros and the many customers they served reinforced our confidence that TurboTax Live has the potential to be transformative to our consumer business in the years to come. It opens up the $20 billion assisted tax prep category and it provides us with an opportunity to grow our dollar share while increasing our average revenue per return. Michelle will share some additional data around our progress in a moment. This season was also the first for our Turbo offering, the consumer financial platform that expands our portfolio beyond tax. Turbo provides customers with a full view of their overall financial health by combining their credit score, verified income data, and a debt-to-income ratio to show customers where they truly stand. This year, TurboTax customers had the option to transfer their tax data into a Turbo account when they completed their return. Nearly 5 million TurboTax customers registered for Turbo in year one, providing us with a strong foundation to extend our business beyond today\u2019s user paid model. The real value of this offering will come as customers engage with it on an ongoing basis. Overall, we feel good about our results this tax season and I want to congratulate all the employees throughout the company who played a role in delivering that performance. We are just getting started with TurboTax Live and we are looking forward to what we can deliver next season. Shifting to the Strategic Partner Group, our professional tax revenue was in line with our expectations for the quarter, with revenue up 4% year-to-date. We continue to focus on multi-service accounting firms that do both books and taxes. This enables us to drive our accountants\u2019 success while growing our small business ecosystem at the same time. Turning to small business, we delivered another strong quarter in our Small Business and Self-Employed Group. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth continued at a rapid pace and Online Ecosystem revenue grew 41%. We exited the quarter with over 3.2 million QuickBooks Online subscribers, a 45% increase year-over-year. Growth remains strong across multiple geographies, with U.S. subscribers growing 40% to approximately 2.5 million and international subscribers growing 66% to about 720,000. Within QuickBooks Online, Self-Employed subscribers grew to over 680,000, up from 360,000 just 1 year ago. Approximately 330,000 of those subscribers are from the TurboTax Self-Employed offering. So, putting a bow around the quarter, our strategy of a vibrant One Intuit ecosystem continues to gain momentum. We performed ahead of our expectations this tax season and delivered continued strong performance in our Small Business and our Self-Employed Group. With that business overview, let me hand it over to Michelle to walk you through the financial details. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Brad and good afternoon everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we delivered revenue of $2.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year, GAAP operating income of $1.6 billion versus $1.4 billion a year ago, non-GAAP operating income of $1.7 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.59, up 24% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.82, up 24% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP tax rate is 26.3%, which is lower than the 27% rate we anticipated earlier this year. The reduction is a result of our continued analysis of the impacts from the new U.S. tax legislation. This lower tax rate contributed $0.05 to non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue grew 15% in the quarter and is up 14% year-to-date exceeding the annual guidance of 7% to 9% we gave at the beginning of the fiscal year. We now expect 14% revenue growth for the year. TurboTax Online units grew 6% this season, while total TurboTax units grew 4%. This unit performance was driven by faster growth in both our paid and free offerings. As Brad mentioned earlier, our share within the DIY category was up slightly, while our share of the total tax preparation market grew 0.5 point. We are pleased with the performance of TurboTax Live in its first season. We scaled the offering from an in-market test during extension filing last fall to a meaningful contributor this season. This is great progress for a new offering in its first year and we are encouraged by the positive feedback we have received. Customers who used our final review feature rated their care experience nearly 20 points higher than those who did not. And TurboTax Live had the highest product recommendation score of any of our consumer tax paid offerings. Additionally, feedback was positive from CPAs, enrolled agents and tax attorneys serving clients on our platform. We look forward to applying what we learned to scale this offering further in the future. Turning to the Strategic Partner Group, we reported $131 million of professional tax revenue for the third quarter, up 4% year-to-date. We now expect revenue to grow 2% to 3% in fiscal 2018, slightly better than the 0% to 2% growth we guided previously. Total Small Business and Self-Employed revenue grew 16% in the quarter. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 41%, up from 39% in the second quarter. We continue to expect Online Ecosystem revenue to grow better than 30%. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 45%, ending the quarter with over 3.2 million subscribers. TurboTax was a significant channel for QuickBooks Self-Employed and a total of 330,000 subscribers have come through that channel. We now expect to end the year with 3.35 to 3.375 million subscribers, equating to approximately 41% to 42% growth. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 3% in the quarter and is up 7% year-to-date. For fiscal 2018, we expect QuickBooks Desktop units to decline mid to high-teens and Desktop Ecosystem revenue to be up mid single-digits. Turning to our financial principles, we continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15%. We finished the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. Our first priority for that cash remains investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. Next, we use acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return cash that we can\u2019t invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased $19 million of shares in the third quarter. Approximately $1.2 billion remains on our authorization. The board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share payable July 18, 2018. Our fourth quarter fiscal 2018 guidance includes revenue growth of 12% to 14%, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.04 to $0.06, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22 to $0.24. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of 24% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26.3% for fiscal 2018. You can find our Q4 and updated fiscal 2018 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I will turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith : Thank you, Michelle. Before closing, I\u2019d like to set some context for the management changes in our Consumer Group that we shared in our earnings release today. Effective at the end of the fiscal year, Dan Wernikoff, General Manager of our Consumer Group, will step down as the leader of Intuit\u2019s consumer business, but he will remain at Intuit working with me on strategic projects. Greg Johnson, Senior Vice President of Marketing will succeed Dan as General Manager of the Consumer Group. Dan has done a tremendous job leading the team and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the foundation that he has built. Under his leadership, we extended our lead in the do-it-yourself category. We advanced our efforts to disrupt the assisted tax prep category and we expanded our business beyond tax. I want to thank him for an outstanding tax season and for repositioning the business for continued growth for years to come. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t be more confident in Greg\u2019s ability to lead the Consumer Group into the next chapter. Greg has spent the last 5 years as a key member of the Consumer Group senior leadership team. He has been leading our go-to-market initiatives, commercial innovation, analytics, and marketing capabilities that have accelerated the growth of Intuit\u2019s tax business. He has been a driving force in the reinvention of our consumer business model, spearheading the introduction of Absolute Zero, helping bring TurboTax Self-Employed and QuickBooks Self-Employed together and was a key member of the team that brought TurboTax Live and Turbo to market this season. For those of you who have followed Intuit for a while, you know that we pride ourselves on building a deep talent bench. And this change is reflective of those efforts. I am excited to watch our momentum continue as Greg takes the baton from Dan to lead the Consumer Group. And to sum it up overall, we delivered a very strong quarter and we feel good about where we stand at this point in the year. While we remain focused on closing out the fiscal year on a high note, we already have our sights set on next year and beyond as we pursue our mission of powering prosperity around the world. But for now, we will continue to keep our heads down and focus on execution with the finish line in sight. And with that, Latif, let\u2019s open it up and hear what\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thank you. Good afternoon. Brad, the Consumer business you started 7% to 9% guidance. You are ending the loan to that almost doubled. I was just curious if you could just bridge the outperformance in what you think the primary reasons were? And if you could also highlight a little bit of TurboTax Live, if there is anymore numbers or financial impacts for that would be helpful to get some color on that? Brad Smith : Sure, Bent, happy to do that. Really, as I mentioned in my opening comments, the season played out the way we anticipated. The two primary growth drivers this year was, an acceleration in DIY category growth and our ability to pickup a little bit of share in that category and then the second was obviously average revenue per customer, which came as a result of increased attach services. We saw a mix shift to the higher end of the product line really brought on by TurboTax Live to a large extent and then we again have some pricing opportunities that was strategically took in key areas where we saw an opportunity to prosper value. Net-net, when you looked at it overall, it was just a well executed plan. The team was able to go out and compete effectively in the free category, while also introducing two new products, TurboTax Live and Turbo. And then I will click down on TurboTax Live for a minute and say that if you remember the strategic context, it is tens of millions of people each year end up going to an assisted tax prep method, because they have a nagging question. They lost confidence in their situation, because something changed year-over-year and we lose about 3 million customers a year because of that in addition to the tens of millions who are in a tax store or a CPA and if they simply had that question answered, they would file taxes on the road using software. What we saw this year was really encouraging with TurboTax Live. Michelle mentioned the fact that those that went through the final review, those consumers are actually went for a final review with the Pro, had a 20 point higher product recommendation score. We also sell very high product recommendation scores from the Pros on the other side of that network. And the other piece that obviously we were looking for is improved retention and we did see improved retention. We will talk more about that at Investor Day. And then last but not least are the sources of new customers are exactly the ones we wanted to see, first time filers entering our category, because there is also a Pro available and we also saw a 10 point higher conversion from assisted tax prep methods for those who signed up for live versus those who just did TTO. So, those are the kinds of numbers that we are willing to share at this point, we are not going to breakdown the actual number of customers or revenue, but you should hear in our tone a high degree of confidence and an excitement about next year. Brent Thill : And just a quick follow-up for Michelle given the outperformance on the top line, we are really not seeing the flow-through as meaningful when you look at the margin structure over the last couple of years. I am just curious if you could talk to when you think you can open up the bottom line margin a little more relative to what you have seen in the last couple of years? Michelle Clatterbuck : I go back to our financial principles. When we think about how we want to use the additional money that we have, it really is first and foremost we want to invest in the business and continue to do that, so we can drive customer and revenue growth. And that\u2019s actually one of the things that we had pointed out earlier this year that we were doing, specifically investing in our transition to AWS and additional AI ML competencies, we also were investing more in our engineering area helping with software development and then marketing efficiencies in our corporate brand. And so we will continue to look at opportunities to invest, to grow the company and then obviously as we get closer in Investor Day we will update you as to what that might look like going forward. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jesse Hulsing of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jesse Hulsing : Yes, thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on the last question around Live, Brad, did you see enough out of the product that you feel like you are going to put your foot on the gas from a marketing perspective for next tax season? And I guess how does marketing live change or differ versus marketing your lower SKUs? Brad Smith : Yes, Jesse, I want to be cautious not to get much of next year\u2019s game plan away, but what I will say is we are confident enough we are going to put our foot on the gas with TurboTax Live. In terms of the messaging, our team actually got a little bit of practice in this year. We had dual campaigns going. One was helping people understand that they could move into free with at least your taxes are free and the other side was there is nothing to be afraid of which began to introduce the fact you can have an expert at the touch of a screen. We learned a lot and we have been running tests in the back half of the season. So, I feel very confident that we can go into market and have a message that basically says we are here for you regardless of your tax situation. And if you have any reason to need someone to work with, we have got somebody right there ahead waiting to connect with you. So, I feel pretty good that we figured out this year how to go out with the campaign to speak to the entire spectrum of tax filers. Jesse Hulsing : Got it. And I guess as king of an extension of that question or response, how comfortable that you feel with I guess price and mix in higher end products being the core driver of the consumer business going forward? Brad Smith : Yes, thank you for the question. We have a principle inside the company that has been a great guiding principle across all of our businesses for years and that is to grow our customers and monetization will follow. Many times that\u2019s translated into growing customers faster than revenue and that is true when you are converting non-consumption. So, you are getting a small business out of a spreadsheet or a shoebox or you are even getting somewhat off a paper and pencil from a tax filing situation and maybe get them into free. Those often come with lower priced products so many times our customer growth outpaces revenue. In the case of tax right now, you have very few people left on paper and pencil, about 5 million people in total. So, it means we are now converting people who already adopted a method and with TurboTax Live we are converting them from higher-priced alternatives. So, when they come into our category, we are getting 3x the average revenue per customer, for those customers that come in with TurboTax Live. So, we are in an interesting situation right now in tax and that is that we are able to grow customers and share and grow average revenue per customer, which is accelerating our revenue growth. So, we are not in a trade-off situation there. I think we are actually in a pretty good situation in being able to do both expand share and grow revenue faster. So I feel good about the strategy and the way it\u2019s playing out. Jesse Hulsing : Okay. Thanks Brad. Brad Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Your line is open. Jennifer Lowe : Great, thank you. I wanted to drill in on the QuickBooks Self-Employed number, particularly those attached to TurboTax and it looks like that slightly more than doubled year-over-year. I know there was some questions about what the renewal rate might look like given that, that was sort of the first experience renewing those types of customers. Can you just give us a little more color on the strength there, how much of that was maybe better renewals, how much of that was better gross adds, what are sort of the major pieces there? Brad Smith : Yes. Thanks, Jennifer. First of all, we did see better renewal rates and retention than we had in our original forecasts. So, we are encouraged by that. The second is we got better at executing converting customers at the end of their tax filing process, the TurboTax into the product itself and the customer experience in the net promoter scores continue to improve. So it was really strength across the board. It was stronger renewals and retention. It was stronger top of funnel conversion and it was also a better quality experience that had the customers actively engage with the products. So we are feeling good about this particular product combination and we are looking forward to next year as well. Jennifer Lowe : Okay, great. And one more from me, so looking at the 5 million Turbo customers that you had registered post-tax season, I think in the past you have talked about sort of longer term monetization opportunities there is around targeting financial offers to those customers and things like that. At this point, what\u2019s sort of the monetization status of that business is it really user acquisition mode at this point or is there certain near-term opportunities to drive revenue there as well? Brad Smith : We are actually executing both, but the priority is customer acquisition and then turning those customers into active daily users or monthly users depending upon their particular financial situation. So we were really encouraged to have 5 million people registered in its first year. That was a number beyond what we had expected and we had some pretty lofty goals ourselves. The monetization strategy as you know was similar to Mint, which is this is one of the products in our portfolio and in addition to Mint, the only two products where less money the customer spends, the more money we make. So said another way, we introduced them to other financial products to give them better deals and lower fees and then those particular companies pay us to reach those customers. And we are seeing a very nice monetization strategy with half a dozen partners we have now and they are seeing very nice conversion rates unqualifiedly, which gives us a reason to lean in as we look ahead to next year, but I would say, the priority right now was more active users and customers. The monetization we proved out this year for us and for our partners is there and we will start leaning into that as we head into next year. Jennifer Lowe : Great, thank you. Brad Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan of RBC. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much. Brad, just I know it\u2019s early, but as we go into next tax season, I guess the big change is that with the new tax legislation it\u2019s very possible that we will see a much higher percentage of the filing population do simple standard deduction and not a itemized deduction. And I wondered if you had any high level thoughts at this point as to how that might impact the DIY category growth? And then I had the one follow-up. Brad Smith : Sure. Thanks, Ross. We spend a lot of time studying the behaviors this year and then working with customers post the end of tax season to better understand their psychology heading into next year. When you know there is some facts, the facts are more people will qualify for standardized deductions, which means they have the opportunity to move to the lower priced products in the DIY category, but it also means we have the opportunity to move out of the assistant tax prep category and into DIY. And when we put all that math together, we see this as a catalyst to grow the do-it-yourself category especially when you introduce services like TurboTax Live, which does enforce the binary choice between doing it yourself for having an expert ready to help you. So, we are really encouraged. We think this is going to be a tailwind for the category and an opportunity for us as we head into next season. Ross MacMillan : Great. And my follow-up was it is actually just a clarification on the 330,000 QBSE TurboTax unit, is that a base number or is that a net add number year-to-date, because I had read that as a total number which implies that the net adds were about flat year-over-year, but Jennifer\u2019s question suggested it might be a net add number. So, could you just clarify that? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes, Ross. You are correct, 330,000 is the base number out of the 683,000 active customers today, so that includes both stronger renewal rates than we had originally anticipated as well as the net adds. Ross MacMillan : Thanks Brad. Brad Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your question please. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thanks. Two questions on [indiscernible] it looks like that business decelerated quite a bit on the desktop side, it grew to sort of couple of percent year-over-year. I am wondering you have seen some really good growth there on sort of similar unit performance early in the year. Could you talk about what drove the difference in growth and I just had a follow-up on subs? Brad Smith : Walter, you cut out on the first part of the question, I heard the desktop question, but I wasn\u2019t sure what product line was it QuickBooks that you are asking about. Walter Pritchard : No, I was trying to ask you if these desktop, the unit growth has been pretty similar, the unit declines have been pretty similar, you have seen stronger revenue performance I think on a year-over-year basis earlier in the year and this quarter is sort of just slight growth, I am wondering what explains the discrepancy in that drove the revenue deceleration in QuickBooks Desktop? Brad Smith : Sure. Got it, Walter. Thank you. Really, it\u2019s an anomaly of a discontinued product that last year in the third quarter recognized some revenue that had been deferred for a period of time. Let me tell you what that product was. You may recall a couple of years ago, we introduced a version of QuickBooks Desktop that included an option we called it the Chooser SKU. When you bought desktop at retail, you could go in and either choose QuickBooks Desktop or you can opt into a subscription of QuickBooks Online and because of accounting rules, we had to defer the revenue on anyone who purchase that product and carried out over the extent of the license. So, what happened was we found that not a lot of customers were taken that product, but the ones who did that revenue got recognized last year in the third quarter. So, we had a little bit of a balloon payment if you will we had to grow over this quarter. If you actually pull that product out, QuickBooks Desktop revenue would have grown 9%, which is in line with the prior quarter. So, it really was a one-time anomaly based upon a discontinued product from a couple of years ago. Walter Pritchard : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on subs for next quarter, the guide at the high end, even 3.375 implies fewer net adds than a year ago and all year you have been seeing growth in the net adds over last year. I am wondering if that\u2019s just conservatism or something else that we explained why you might see a more significant decel in the net adds? Brad Smith : Walter, conservatism is in the eyes of the holder. We are clearly leaning in and thinking about how do we continue to accelerate our QuickBooks Online subscriber growth both here and in the international markets? And I do still give the momentum we have. We are testing right now in this fourth quarter of our fiscal year different promotional approaches, different discounting rates. And so we give ourselves a little bit of an opportunity to experiment, so that when we head into peak season in the fall, we really have a game plan we feel confident in. So, you should probably consider that as a little bit of hedge for us as we are testing things, as we wrap up this fiscal year and get ready for next year. Walter Pritchard : Great. Thank you. That makes sense. Appreciate the color. Brad Smith : Thank you. Yes, me too. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Hey, Brad. I have a two-parter for you and then a follow-up for Michelle. When you list revenue per return, you mentioned in order attach then mix shift then strategic price increase. And I am just curious is that the rank order, were they all 3 equal or won a little bit more and then the follow-up is on that is could you elaborate a little bit on attach, particularly if it is truly the number one? Brad Smith : Yes, I appreciate it. We will unpack a little more of this in Investor Day, but I would give you this, I would put in the order of mix shift, attach and then price and it\u2019s just by small percentage points, so there isn\u2019t a significant variation across those. And then in terms of attach, we have different bundles, we have a plus bundle you can come in and purchase, we have some security features, we have the ability to do audits, defense, if you decide that you want to have some protection against being audited by the IRS. We had the refund transfer, which is the ability for you as we call it refund. What is it called now, refund some conservatism? The ability to pay for the software out of your refund and it\u2019s a combination of those that basically had to attach. There wasn\u2019t really anything that we did this year that was a breakthrough new offering in attach, it was just continuing to find better ways to expose customers to those products when they have a point of need. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks for that. And Michelle, just have the guide on CapEx down $50 million for the full year, could you just remind us how we should think about that, not just this year, but kind of going forward? Thank you. Michelle Clatterbuck : Sure. Thanks, Scott. Our CapEx for this year, if you look at where we are \u2013 for the year-to-date, actually, there is a couple of different things that are impacting that. And as we have talked about transitioning to AWS, what that means then is we don\u2019t have to do all of the refreshing in our data centers and so that\u2019s having an impact there. One of the other things is we do have some lower software capitalization. And then last year at this time we were still doing some of the renovation and construction on our Mountain View campus and so that had inflated last year. And so we will continue to look at that. We will give you some more insights into that as we think about going forward at Investor Day, but those are the big drivers of the decrease that you are seeing right now. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank your. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your question please. Brad Reback : Great, thanks very much. Michelle, if we go back to some of the margin commentary if we think about it from a high level, is this situation where the gross profit dollars should continue to outpace OpEx dollar growth, so cash flow should be a net-net benefit going forward? Brad Smith : I am sorry, Brad, could you repeat the question. She wasn\u2019t clear about the question. Brad Reback : Yes, sure, absolutely. So, should we think about gross profit dollars growing faster than OpEx dollars, so while the margin may go down in the future, the cash flow benefit is still positive? Michelle Clatterbuck : I am not sure if that is actually, I am trying to think through that right now, I don\u2019t know I thought about it that way. Brad Smith : So I can jump in. I mean, if you assume that the cost of goods sold is going to be relatively stable at about 15%, then gross margin is going to be about the same rate of growth as revenue and our operating margin dollars usually we are just a little bit faster than revenue, they are not this year, but that\u2019s typically what they do. So Brad, I think you will back into an answer that\u2019s pretty much what you are expecting. No, go ahead. Brad Reback : No, I was just going to say thanks. Go ahead, Brad. Brad Smith : Well, what I was going to do, I know this came up earlier and Michelle answered it and then this question came up just now and I thought I\u2019d unpack for you a couple of points that I thought Michelle did a really nice job of putting out there. The first is our financial principles in the company remain enduring and we just reviewed them with the board a couple of weeks ago, which is double-digit organic growth on the top line, grow revenue faster than expense, which allows us to grow operating income dollars in the mid-teens. As we entered this year, we saw four opportunities that we wanted to lean in to invest that we said would both accelerate our top line growth this year, but would set the foundation for a stronger multiyear growth opportunity ahead and those were the areas that Michelle walked through. We saw accelerated top line growth this year and we also saw strong operating income growth of 13%. We will come back and talk about our financial principles again in August at Investor Day. But you should hear our anticipation that we are going to not continue to get good operating leverage out of this company in terms of growing our operating income dollars. This was a strategic choice. This is not a business model question. We sell opportunities to invest in technology, data sciences, accelerating into AWS, which by the way TurboTax RAM 100% and second peak at AWS and we saw real benefit from that and then of course the brand. So I am putting that out there just so if there is a question on anyone\u2019s mind about is there an issue with the operating leverage of the company, I can tell you with straight eyes and a clear heart, the answer is no. Brad Reback : Got it. Very clear. Thanks, Brad. Brad Smith : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Nice quarter guys and thank you for taking the question. Again, I tried to sort of attack head on and I think the question that like everybody is trying to get at consumer had a great quarter this quarter and a great year-to-date, I don\u2019t think 14% is the highest I have seen in my model. Is there anything one-time in nature that we should be thinking about in this year versus prior years that makes this special, if you will, that or non-repeatable or can we potentially see a higher durable rate of consumer growth on a going forward basis given sort of how you expanded the product portfolio there? Brad Smith : Yes. Thanks, Keith. We will talk about what we think the durable growth opportunity is in this business when we get into the fall. We have historically said at the 5% to 10% grower and we fully are aware that the last couple of years has been double-digits this year versus even further up into the teens. But what I do think is different is what I touched on a few minutes ago, historically, when we tried to grow the category and grow customers, they often came in with a free offering around the lower end of our product line up. Now as we are getting customers to come in with TurboTax Live and we are getting customers out of the assisted tax prep method, they are coming in at a higher average revenue per customer. So as we expand the category and grow customers, we are also growing revenue. And so I don\u2019t believe you see a one-time events here, I think you are starting to see a structural shift in the business economics that if we can continue to execute should give us a really good sustainable growth rate as we look ahead, but we will talk much more about what that looks like when we get into the fall. Keith Weiss : Excellent. That\u2019s very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hi, Brad. Brad Smith : Hi, Kartik. Operator : Mr. Mehta, your line is open. Please continue. Please make sure your line is un-muted. Kartik Mehta : The TurboTax Live product this year, what was the primary objective for you for this year and what would you say the primary objective will be for that product next year? Brad Smith : Kartik, I think that the majority of your question, I heard TurboTax Live, what was the primary objective this year and what will be the primary objective next year, was that your question? Kartik Mehta : Yes. Brad Smith : So, what we did seek this year to do was to say if we could impact the 3 million customers on average that we tend to lose when something changes in their tax situation, they either have a child to get married, they move between states, they sell stock. They have that nagging question and we wanted to see it by introducing a Pro we could actually improve our retention in our existing customer base is the primary objective. As I mentioned earlier, we will talk more about what the results look like as we get into the fall, but we did achieve that. The other thing we wanted to say is that we could change the source of new customers coming into the category. And if we could begin to bring people into the category as first time filers who may have gone to an assisted method or actually get people of our tax stores and CPAs and so far the mix of new customers as we finished this season also looks like we have been successful improving that hypothesis. So as we lean into next year, the primary objective is going to be to transform the $20 billion assisted tax prep category and begin to bring more of them into the do-it-yourself category. We think that will be the big opportunity for us over the long run. Kartik Mehta : And then Brad as you talk about on the tax side maybe getting some pricing, do you think has the market changed and do you believe there is an opportunity for you to maybe raise prices more than you have in the past, because maybe consumers are seeing the value a little bit more now than they have in the past? Brad Smith : Well, Kartik as you know you follow the space really closely. It\u2019s a hypercompetitive market when you get into the free category. And as we mentioned a few minutes ago, tax legislation will give more people the opportunity to qualify for standardized deductions, so they could move into lower end products, lower priced products or even free, but we have also seen that consumers are willing to pay for value and the ability to have someone answer their question is convenience of coming through the software and being there at the point of need and they can schedule when they want to talk to that person is something that customers are willing to pay for. So, we do feel like with the right strategic value proposition that we can continue to grow revenue, while also growing the category. In terms of taking price, if there is not value-add relative to a competitor that become difficult and so we have to be able to differentiate and deliver more than our competitors can for us to earn a higher price. Kartik Mehta : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Brad Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Brad, did you say clear eye and a straight heart or clear heart and a straight eye? That was not a question, both replied actually. My question is when you look at the profile, either demographic of waterproof profile, how are we to categorize people that came in on TurboTax Live. I am curious how much of that is flow from competition that was brick-and-mortar versus upgrade from your existing base are people that might have to your point try to, because the tariffs got complicated or even perhaps people that were going to a professional accountant that were using professional TurboTax. So, if you could characterize the flow of business in TurboTax Live and where you see the different vectors hoping that you can actually project these vectors into the future and help us understand the bigger picture of how it all plays out, let\u2019s say, TurboTax is going to be as live is going to be as big as potentially TurboTax, the core business. Where do you see the inflow coming from it? And from a product standpoint, as you went through one RAM of this season, what changes do you see making to TurboTax Live next year from a product standpoint that will equip the company even better, forget the go-to-market, but for products perspective? Thank you. Brad Smith : Yes, thank you, Kash and thank you for helping me think through the quotes and the things that I use here. Sometimes that West Virginia side of me comes out and I can\u2019t even remember what I said. So, let me start first with we are going to breakout a lot more detail on TurboTax Live when we get into the fall at Investor Day. As we always do, we will share sources of customer, but I will hit at a high level, what we are encouraged by is as you know 3 million to 5 million people enter the tax category for the first time each year. They filed their first return. There is a whole host of reasons why people end up filing the first time. They are filing jointly. They are divorced. They are entering the workforce for the first time out of college. So, you take any one of those scenarios, we saw a disproportionate inflow into the category and into TurboTax. So that was exciting. So, we do know that\u2019s an evergreen source of customers and we will talk more about that in the fall. The other thing we saw as customers who have been with TurboTax a couple of years ago and had left, we saw them coming home. And so that was a good opportunity for us as well. They had gone to an assisted tax prep method or some other alternatives. And then we did see those who have been with an assisted method whether it\u2019s a tax or CPA, we actually saw TurboTax Live for all about 10 points more from that category than regular TurboTax Online does. So, we do like the sources of customers, they are first-time filers, they are people who used to be what is coming home or are those people who tend to be going to an assisted tax prep method. We will break out the granularity later. In terms of the opportunity, we still have a lot to prove to ourselves and to prove to you, but if you look at the tax category, it\u2019s about a $20 billion assisted tax prep category and we have a very small sliver today. So, this could be a very nice business for us. If we can continue to execute well and create more value than any of the other alternatives in the market, we will just have to see how big that is. Kash Rangan : The product perspective, thanks, if you have the time, otherwise no big sweat. Brad Smith : Yes, Kash, I would rather at this point in time not to get ahead of our headlights in terms of sharing what we are going to do in the products. Obviously, there are lot of people in the marketplace that are interested in what we felt we did this year with TurboTax Live and what we will plan to do next year not all of them were investors. And so we just want to make sure that we keep some of those product plans close to the vest and we will talk more about that when we are getting ready to launch the product. Kash Rangan : Completely understand. Thank you so much and congratulations. Brad Smith : Thank you, Kash. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Siti Panigrahi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for taking my question. Going back to QBO internet 720,000 that\u2019s pretty good growth, how much of that driven by this QBO\u2019s Small Business versus Self-Employed? And also you talked about France, Brazil, India product marketplace, could you give some update on that when we should start seeing some kind of growth from those regions? Brad Smith : Yes, thanks Siti. So I would say first of all predominantly the growth in the international markets was driven by QBO core as opposed to QuickBooks Self-Employed. That product is ramping up and we are continuing to add functionality that is very country specific and we are excited about its prospect, but right now, the core growth that 66% growth was really driven primarily by QBO. In terms of the other markets and these were the markets where we are still in search of product market fit, France is really looking healthier by the day and we like what we are seeing in India in terms of prospects. We are actively engaged right now on a process for the government is opening up the technology stack and looking for a handful of providers that help them implement GST, which is their new tax situation that impacts small businesses. Brazil right now, we are still working through, we don\u2019t have clarity yet in terms of how best to capitalize on the acquisition we did with ZeroPaper as well as around QuickBooks Online offering. So I would just say in terms of sequencing, I would do France and India is a little ahead of the pack and Brazil is a little bit further behind, but we are on the trail of all of them and we have got a team actively working to make sure that we turn those dashboards green and get the product market fit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Thanks for taking my questions and congrats from me as well obviously. Quick question on Turbo and Brad, can you talk a little bit about the \u2013 you talked earlier about how you like what you saw the early monetization, can you talk a little about the activity levels of the clients that you sign up to 5 million, how is that going in terms of what you see what they are doing with the product, how often you are using that etcetera? Brad Smith : Yes, thanks Raimo. And this actually has been as Scott Cook, our Founder, would say savor the surprise. We know what the average met customer looks like, we know what their credit score is, we know what their decisions tend to be in terms of their financial investments, Turbo is bringing in a different customer, actually, a customer that\u2019s a little more paycheck-to-paycheck with a lower credit score and much more in need of the kinds of financial services, the partners that we are working with can bring them. And so their active use is different than what we might see from a Mint customer or any other products we have had in the past like Quicken. And so we are in the process of learning as we speak. What we are finding is things like alerts and notifications making them aware of changes in their financial situation are very important to them. And we also know that, that drives active engagement. So we are at the process of saying we have 5 million people who have registered. Now, what can we do to actively engage with them and help them make the best decisions to improve their financial health? And then as we get closer to the fall we will be able to share with you some of those insights and we will break apart for you, the differences we are seeing in these customers relative to other products. But I will say this, we are very encouraged by how many people signed up, we are encouraged by the fact that as they save more money we make money and we are encouraged by the fact that the quality of the leads that we are getting to our partners in some cases is 8x to 10x better in conversion than what they have gotten from other sources. And so that for us is a real win, win, win and now if we can just turn them into active users and they get more of them, we think we have a viable business over the long-term. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. And one follow-up question from me on the investment side, can you talk me through like where are you on the move towards AWS, I think I have heard earlier you said TurboTax RAM 100% on AWS that should have been a big benefit for you guys just overall like I have referred the investment initiatives, but where are you in the process of kind of doing some of the major ones? Brad Smith : Yes. So Raimo as you know we have been working towards getting into AWS for several years now, little over 4 years and there was a combination of getting our products architected working with AWS to ensure the levels of security for the kinds of data that we have in our products and then migrating the products in. TurboTax, as I mentioned, has been in the process of last year and this year moving into AWS and when we got the second peak which was mid-April we were able to RAM 100% of our volume through AWS and we were delighted with the performance of the product, the quality, the experience, everything was really above expectations. At QuickBooks Online and the major small business products are in the process of moving in, we hope to get those moved in, in the next 12 months and then we will have a long tale of other services we will be moving out of our own data center and into AWS and that will probably have another 12 months or so after that. But right now what we are dealing with is we have a double bubble, we have talked about that before, where we have our own datacenter up and we also have AWS. And so that\u2019s part of the investment that we foreshadowed as we went into this year, we got to be paying for volume in AWS, while we continue to pay to keep the lights on in our own datacenter until we get everything moved out of our garage and into theirs. And we feel good. We actually like what we are seeing in terms of how our products perform when they are on AWS and we got another call it 24 plus months to get everything moved over. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Very clear. Well done. Brad Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Your question please. Jim MacDonald : Yes, good afternoon guys. Believe it or not I have another TurboTax Live question, did you have any capacity issues either supply or demand or can you talk a little bit about that, did you have enough on either side of the equation there? Brad Smith : Thanks, Jim. Never apologize for asking about any of the products and certainly about TurboTax Live. We are very, very proud of this product offering this year. And the short answer to your question is no, we did not. We were delighted by the supply of professionals who wanted to work with us on the platform. We were delighted by our team and the ability to match supply and demand in real time and maintain the service levels where you could be connected within minutes or you have the ability to schedule at your own convenience when you wanted to have a professional connect with you. And we were also delighted to see that customers and pros were willing to flex and in some cases at the end of the season they said hey, I will go ahead and file an extension, because I am not ready to get myself to a Pro. So, it really did at the end of the day work out much better than we had hoped and I think at the end of the day it\u2019s also an opportunity to re-imagine this entire category, because many times you are constrained in an office when you have a log sitting in the front office waiting to get their turn to get their taxes done, but in our case we have pros working from home and they can come in at any point in time and help you get it done. So, I think this is really a game changer. Jim MacDonald : Very good. And just on a different subject, your QuickBooks Online services seem to be particularly strong this quarter, was there anything going on there? Brad Smith : Yes, Jim, it was. We are excited by the fact that our teams and we have been talking about this for some time and acknowledge we needed to improve our execution, but our teams have continued to improve our execution behind both payroll and payments that was helping drive our online services. And then in addition to that, we did have a quarter of TSheets, the acquisition, the time and attendance acquisition that rolled into those services as well. But it really is a continued improvement in our ability to execute those services beyond just core accounting and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving that growth? Jim MacDonald : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Brad, you mentioned that in the DIY category that you gained a slight amount of market share, were you satisfied with the share gains that you saw, were you surprised that maybe they weren\u2019t more and what did you see in the marketplace that maybe limited some of the share gains that you saw this year? Brad Smith : Yes, thank you Sterling. We have really good competitors. They continue to invent and reinvent their game every year as we do. And I think that in the end of the day is good for us as we have to take our game to the next level and it\u2019s certainly good for the consumer. And if you look at everyone who has reported publicly, ourselves and the second placed player in the market, it looks like we have picked up share and so far the others who have reported seemed to have not. And in terms of how we performed of course I would always like to remove the word slightly and then they we gained share, but if I keep things in perspective given how hypercompetitive it was this year, I am very proud of the fact that we were able to continue to build on our market share. And at the same time, we introduced products like Turbo and TurboTax Live. So each year we are going to come out and our game plan is going to be to try to increase market share in the category, while we expand into these other services. And I am really pleased the team did that this year. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much and I will add my congrats in the quarter. Brad, thank you for sort of reiterating your financial principles and what you are thinking about that going into next year, I guess my question is if we are in a situation where consumer growth is going to be higher for longer that obviously gives you a lot more flexibility from an investment perspective. Could you just talk about whether or not the success you had in the quarters allows you to accelerate your investments whether it\u2019s in the areas like AI or in certain products that I guess you offered maybe just insights into how you are thinking about that from your investment perspective as we had into the next fiscal year? Thanks. Brad Smith : Yes, thank you Kirk. Appreciate the kind words on the performance in the quarter that the team delivered. Our financial principles give us the flexibility to continue to invest and as Michelle talked about when we produced cash flow, our first priority is to invest in the business, accelerate customer and revenue growth. And then we look for acquisitions and we return cash to shareholders whether it\u2019s stock repurchase or dividends, but you may recall this year we also talked about an initiative we implemented called Reinvent-to-Reinvest, where we look across the company as the lower ROI investments and we basically redirect those resources, time, people and dollars to higher priority areas. And this year under the leadership of Michelle, we found over $190 million that we have been able to redirect to higher priority areas and we already have plans in place to even increase that number as we look at fiscal year \u201819 and beyond. So I do believe that we have the opportunity within our financial principles and also within our ability to just take a hard look at ourselves and say, there are areas where we could spend dollar more wisely that we are going to continue to redirect those dollars to things like artificial intelligence and machine learning global expansion, TurboTax Live, Turbo, QuickBooks capital and all those other things we have talked to you about. And we have that capacity to do so without harming our financial principles. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open. Michael Millman : Thank you. Given IRS numbers in the past several years, the growth in do-it-yourself has been about 5 points higher than it has been insisted. This past year, it dropped to 2.5 I was wondering if you could talk about it, because it seems at variance was what would think? Second question is I think this is your number that there is about 30 million taxpayers who don\u2019t itemize, but yet there is assisted, why do you think if we increase that number with a higher standard deduction \u2013 those people will change to do-it-yourself? Thank you. Brad Smith : Yes, thank you Michael. It\u2019s good to hear from you. First of all, we would say that relative to the prior years, the thing we keep in mind is the assisted category is do-it-yourself outpacing assisted and obviously it is. This year was a little bit of a fear uncertainty and doubt year. There was a lot of confusion in the market as tax legislation came out, does it affect this year, does it affect next year, which is why TurboTax Live was so important. So if you had a question we wanted to let you know that we could help you with a tax professional. So I can\u2019t really tell you why this year we solve maybe a less accelerated growth. We do know that the category picked up 0.5 point of share which is good and we believe that that opportunities continues to increase with two things, with tax legislation taking full effect next year and then us having TurboTax Live out there as that people know that if they do have a question they can move into our category and still have the assistance of a tax pro. And that really answers your second question, the 30 million people today who were filing a 1040EZ or A or have what could be simple returns would still go to a tax pro. They are doing so, because they don\u2019t realize that with just one or two quick answers in a 5-minute exchange they could file their taxes for a much lower price. We believe it\u2019s not just pack simplification, but it\u2019s TurboTax Live that will allow us to shift the category into do-it-yourself and to get more of those filers using TurboTax. So as the legislation and TurboTax Live that we think will help us fundamentally grow the category. Michael Millman : Very good. Thank you. Brad Smith : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I am not showing any further questions. Would you close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith : Yes, thanks Latif and I want to thank everybody for your time and for your questions today. I hope everyone has a great Memorial Day weekend. We are looking forward to speaking with you soon and until then take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

My name is Latif, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session period [Operator Instructions]. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Mr. Natoli? Jerry Natoli : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon. And welcome to Intuit\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. I am here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO; Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO; and Sasan Goodarzi our incoming CEO. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2017 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s Web site at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. We are reporting fiscal year 2018 results today under the historical revenue recognition standard ASC 605. We adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 in fiscal year 2019, which began August 1, 2018. We elected to adopt ASC 606 under the full retrospective model for comparability and we have provided restated financials for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 in the press release issued today and on our fact sheet. We also posted a slide deck to the Investor Relations section on Intuit Web site at www.intuit.com highlighting the significant changes under ASC 606. Michelle will discuss the impact of this change during her prepared remarks. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our Web site after this call ends. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brad. Brad Smith : Thanks, Jerry and thanks to all of you for joining us. As you read in our press release today, I'll be stepping down as the Chief Executive Officer of Intuit at the end of 2018, and continue to serve as our Executive Chairman. I am happy to announce that Sasan Goodarzi will become Intuit\u2019s next CEO on January 1, 2019. Sasan is also with us on the call today. I'll share more thoughts about Sasan and why I feel it's the right time to pass the baton to him in January at the end of this call. But first let's talk about our results in fiscal year 2018 and our outlook for fiscal year 2019. We had an excellent fourth quarter, capping off a very strong fiscal year 2018. Fourth quarter revenues grew 17% and full-year revenues grew 15%. We are one year into a multiyear change journey and our results confirm that our refresh One Intuit Ecosystem strategy is positioning the Company through durable growth as we look ahead. Revenue growth accelerated across our businesses in fiscal year 2018. This growth was fueled by 18% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and 14% growth in the Consumer Group. As you can see reflected in our guidance for fiscal year 2019, we expect to deliver another year of strong revenue growth. With that overview, let me share some observations on our business performance. We delivered another successful quarter in our Small Business and Self-Employed Group. Online ecosystem revenue grew 43% in the fourth quarter and 40% for the fiscal year, exceeding our projects to grow better from 30%. We added over 1 million QuickBooks Online subscribers in fiscal year 2018 exceeding with more than 3.4 million subscribers, a 43% increase year-over-year. Growth remains strong across multiple geographies with U.S. subscribers growing 38% to approximately 2.6 million and international subscribers growing 62% to over 800,000. Within QuickBooks Online, Self-Employed subscribers grew to nearly 720,000, up from roughly 390,000 just one year ago. As we move to the fiscal year 2019, we\u2019re placing a greater focus on additional services and penetrating a broader range of customers. Online ecosystem revenue growth has emerged as the best stages held and success in this business and it now represents more than $1 billion. Even at this scale, we continue to expect online ecosystem revenues to see 30% growth year-over-year, the subscriber base beginning to moderate some as we shift our emphasis in the next chapter of the business model evolution. With the focus on online ecosystem revenue growth, we will no longer be providing forward-looking guidance for subscriber growth, but we will continue to share our actual QuickBooks Online subscriber count on our factsheet. Turning to the Consumer Group, as we shared last quarter, we\u2019ve had a successful tax season. Consumer revenues grew 14% in fiscal year 2018 as the innovation drove customer and revenue growth, and we made encouraging progress behind each of our strategic priorities. Our team is actively developing the next wave of innovation to better serve our customers\u2019 next season. We\u2019re excited about the opportunities ahead with TurboTax Live to further transform the assisted category and for our Turbo and Mint offerings to expand our business beyond tax. With regards to the external environment, I want to share our thoughts on the tax legislation changes going to effect next season. We have long advocated for tax simplification. We think anything to make taxes easier to understand is good for consumers. As you know, the new legislation increased the standard deduction, so a larger number of people won't be required to itemize their deduction. This change does introduce some trade down risk from our paid to our free offering but in aggregate, we believe tax simplification will be an overall catalyst for DIY category and TurboTax growth as more assisted customers choose to adopt digital solutions. In addition, the internal revenue service has been working on developing a streamlined tax filing form, consisting of one summary form and six supporting schedules. We\u2019re working closely with the IRS to fully understand the changes to the 1040 forms, and we\u2019ll ensure that all of our forms and our products are up to date as we do every year. We\u2019ll share more information later this year when we introduce our offerings for next season. In our Strategic Partner Group, our professional tax revenue was slightly ahead of our expectations as revenue grew 4% in fiscal year 2018. We continue to focus on multiservice accounting firms that do both books and taxes. This enabled us to drive our account success while growing our small business ecosystem at the same time. Putting a goal around fiscal year 2018, we\u2019re one year into our refresh One Intuit Ecosystem strategy with our business gaining momentum and significant opportunity ahead. We\u2019re activating our ecosystem by connecting our customers, our partners and our products across product lines through value creating solutions. This includes offerings such as our Pro Advisor matchmaking platform, TurboTax line and our TurboTax self-employed bundle. We see many more opportunities to connect our ecosystem with newer offerings, such as QuickBook Capital and Turbo, as well as others on the horizon. We\u2019ll share our progress on each of these offerings at our upcoming Investor Day. With that overview, let me hand it over to Michelle who to walk you through the financial details. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Brad and good afternoon everyone. As Jerry mentioned at the beginning of the call, I\u2019ll review our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 results under ASC 605. I\u2019ll also provide guidance under both the new revenue recognition standards 606, and historical standards 605 for comparability. Let\u2019s start with results for the fourth quarter for fiscal 2018; we delivered revenue of $988 million, up 17% year-over-year; a GAAP operating loss of $81 million versus a $10 million loss a year ago; Non GAAP income of $104 million versus $78 million last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.18 versus $0.09 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.32, up 60% versus $0.20 last year. For full fiscal year 2018, we delivered revenue of $6 billion, up 16% year-over-year; GAAP operating income of $1.5 billion versus $1.4 billion a year ago; non-GAAP operating income of $2 billion, up 14% versus last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share $4.64, up 25% versus $3.72 last year; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.61, up 27% versus $4.41 last year. As previously announced our GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 include $79 million charge from the sale of our data center in Quincy, Washington. The impact of this charge on net income and EPS was offset by tax benefits that recognize in the quarter. Turning to the business segments, total Small Business and Self-Employed revenue grew 20% for the quarter and 18% for the year, this compare to 14% growth in fiscal year 2017. Online ecosystem revenue growth remained strong and grew 43% in the fourth quarter, up from 41% in the third quarter. For fiscal year 2018, online ecosystem revenues grew 40%, up from 30% in fiscal year 2017. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 43%, ending the quarter with over 3.4 million subscribers. As Brad mentioned, we believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy going forward is online ecosystem revenue growth, which we continue to expect to grow better than 30%. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter and in the fiscal year 2018. Desktop units fell 7% in the fourth and 15% in fiscal year 2018, which was in line with our expectations. For fiscal 2019, we expect QuickBooks\u2019 desktop unit to decline single digits and desktop ecosystem revenue to be roughly flat. Including both online and desktop customers, our total QuickBook paying customers grew 26% in fiscal year 2018. Total QuickBook paying customers includes QuickBook Online customers, QuickBook Desktop unit and QuickBook Desktop subscribers. The Consumer Group had a strong year with revenue up 14% compared to 8% revenue growth in fiscal year 2017. TurboTax units grew 4% and TurboTax online units were up 6%. The Strategic Partner Group posted $453 million of professional tax revenue for fiscal year 2018, up 4%. Turning to our financial principles, we continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield return on investment greater than 15%. During fiscal year 2018, we focused on reallocating resources to strengthen our investments in several key priorities, including increasing our capability in artificial intelligence and machine learning, accelerating our transition to Amazon Web services, enhancing our brand and marketing effectiveness globally and enabling our engineering organization to increase effectiveness and efficiency. At the beginning of fiscal year 2018, we told you that we expect these initiatives to set us up to deliver strong growth in the coming years. We saw this momentum begin in fiscal year 2018; revenue growth accelerated approximately 5 points to 15%; GAAP operating income grew 7%, including $79 million charge from the sale of our datacenter; non-GAAP operating income growth accelerated approximately 2 points to 14%. We finished the year with $1.7 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. Our first priority for that cash remains investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. Next, we use acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap; we returned excess cash that we can invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends; we repurchased over $270 million of stock during fiscal year 2018; the Board approved a new $2 billion repurchase authorization, giving us a total authorization of $3.2 billion to repurchase shares, including the remaining amount on our prior authorization; the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share payable October 18, 2018, this represents a 21% increases versus last year. As I mentioned, we are adopting ASC 606, the new accounting standard for revenue recognition in fiscal year 2019. We will be reporting our results under this standard going forward, and will be restating the financial statements of previous years to provide comparability. The new standard will result in an increase in revenue for fiscal year 2018 of $61 million and a decrease in expected revenue of $30 million in fiscal year 2019. While we're changing how we account for revenue under 606, this is an accounting change only and has no impact on customer billings or cash flow. In addition, how we recognize revenue for all online offering, supply and desktop payroll and payments will not change. What will change under the new rules is how we account for revenue associated with QuickBooks Desktop units, QuickBooks Desktop subscription offering and consumer and professional tax desktop offerings. I'll highlight the changes briefly, but please review the materials in the Investors section of our Web site for more detail. The primary change for our QuickBooks Desktop units and subscription offerings under 606 is that more revenue will be recorded in earlier periods. The primary change for our consumer and professional tax desktop offering is that more revenue will be recognized at the beginning of the tax season under 606. We expect the net impact of adopting 606 to be approximately a 2 point reduction in our revenue growth in fiscal year 2019 versus the prior standard. Under 606, Q1 fiscal 2019 guidance includes revenue growth of 5% to 7%, a GAAP loss per share of $0.17 to $0.19 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.09 to $0.11. While we\u2019re not providing quarterly guidance under 606, our Q1 fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance would have been approximately $30 million higher than it is under 606. You can find additional Q1 and fiscal 2019 guidance details under 606 in our press release and on our factsheet. And just one more comment on Q1, we expect desktop ecosystem revenue to decline single digits in Q1 of fiscal year 2019. This reflects the change we made in fiscal year 2018, moving our QuickBooks enterprise subscription offering from a perpetual license to a term license to better serve our customers. Under 606, our full year fiscal 2019 guidance includes total Company revenue growth of 8% to 10%, GAAP earnings per share of $5.25 to $5.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.40 to $6.50. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for fiscal 2019. To help you compare with the forecast you have in your model, we\u2019re also providing guidance under ASC 605. Our full year fiscal 2019 guidance under the historical 605 standards include total Company revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP earnings per share of $5.35 to $5.45 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.50 to $6.60. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith : Great, thanks, Michelle. In summary, we delivered a strong year in fiscal 2018 posting a faster pace of revenue growth than we have seen in several years as our One Intuit Ecosystem strategy takes shape. We continue to have our sight fit on next year and beyond as we pursue our mission of powering prosperity around the world. With that overview, let\u2019s now shift to the other news we announced today. Sasan is the right executive to lead Intuit in our next chapter. During his 13 years with the Company, he had successfully led each of our major businesses and served as our Chief Information Officer. He has been instrumental in the transformation of our Company and a key architect of our One Intuit Ecosystem strategy. He leads with intellectual curiosity and humility, as well as strategic and operational rigor. At every stop, Sasan has built high performing and highly engaged teams who deliver amazing results. I am confident in his ability to lead the Company to new high and I am looking forward to working with him in his new role. When Sasan steps into the role of CEO on January 1st, he will be succeeded by Alex Chriss as the General Manager of the Small Business and Self-Employee Group. Alex is another Intuit veteran with a stellar track record of success over the past 14 years. We also announce today that Tayloe Stansbury will be stepping down as our Chief Technology Officer on January 1, 2019. This move is another possible transition in a multiyear succession planning process that has been in the works for some time. I want to thank Tayloe for his many contributions over the past nine years, having let our evolution to a platform company, advanced our leadership in artificial intelligence and machine learning and accelerated our journey to the cloud. Tayloe has built an amazing leadership bench. We successfully prepared Marianna Tessel, our current Chief Product Development Officer for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group to be his successor as CTO in January. And on a personal note, it has been a privilege to serve as Intuit CEO since 2008. Together, we\u2019ve built on the strong foundation that those before us have put in place. We\u2019ve transformed the Company from a North American desktop software company to a global cloud driven product and platform company. We deliver consistent top line and bottom-line growth, and we\u2019ve cultivated a strong and enduring culture of innovation and self-disruption. Today's announcement is a continuation of a long history of leadership development that has built a deep bench of leaders who will take their place as the next generation at Intuit\u2019s management team. As I look ahead, I have never felt better about Intuit\u2019s future. So with that, let\u2019s open it up and hear what\u2019s on your mind. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh : This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss and sorry to see you go Brad and congratulations Sasan. Brad maybe I could start with tax, this year was a very strong year and you guys saw a lot of uptake with TurboTax Live. As you think about the tax changes going into next year with maybe a little more of the demand coming from simpler tax filings. What do you think the implications are for the TurboTax Live portion in terms of the benefit that you can see from that portion of consumer tax? Brad Smith : Sanjit, I would tell you we\u2019re very encouraged by this year\u2019s performance in TurboTax Live we\u2019re optimistic about the opportunities as we look ahead. As you know just to put context around this, today there are more people who file using an assisted tax prep method than those who use do it yourself. And we discovered tens millions who will be willing to actually use a do it yourself solution if they have the access to an expert to answer some questions that they may have in the back of their mind. So it opens up $20 billion TAM. And when we introduced TurboTax Live this year, we had two hypothesis, first the first is could we actually retain more of those 3 million customers who leave each year when they have a life even change, like they had a baby or they sold stock. And I\u2019m proud to tell you that we improved our retention very strongly, in this past tax season we\u2019ll talk more about that at Investor Say. The second hypothesis was could we start to attract more people at tax stores and assisted method into TurboTax to TurboTax Live. And this year, TurboTax Live did indeed increase a 10% acquisition of customers out of an assisted method versus the standard TurboTax Online offering, so both hypotheses proved to be true. But there was one other surprise that occurred in tax season. Each year, 3 to 5 million people enter the tax filing process for the first time. We have always gotten our fair share with digital solutions, but with TurboTax Live, we actually pulled a disproportionate share first time filers in this franchise. So we're seeing an improvement in retention, we\u2019re seeing an acquisition increase from those who were using assisted method and we\u2019re seeing a disproportionate share of first time filers that gives us a lot of confidence that next year and beyond TurboTax Live could potentially be a game changer if we continue to execute well. Keith Weiss : And maybe just if I can sneak in one more on the QBO subs, you mentioned in your script that growth might slow a little bit next year versus the strong growth you saw last year. How does that relate to your overall expansion efforts, particularly on the international side and also with QuickBooks Self-Employed? Are those international markets slower to ramp or are you starting to see some slowdown on the Self-Employee side as well? Brad Smith : I appreciate the question, and let me set some context around why we\u2019ve made this decision. We\u2019re at the next chapter of the business model evolution in QuickBooks Online and we do fundamentally believe that the online ecosystem revenue growth is the appropriate measure for health going forward, and let me explain why. First and foremost, we\u2019re now starting to serve an expanded group of customers from the self-employee to the core QBO with U.S. international and now we\u2019re expanding into what we used to call the mid-market or enterprise space with QuickBooks Online Advanced, we\u2019re going to be talking more about that in the fall. And so you\u2019ve gone to have an expanded group of customers each coming in with a different revenue stream. On the other side, we have our online services which you probably saw accelerate in this quarter, very strong growth 34% growth. That's not only payroll and payments attached we\u2019re also beginning to introduce those services as their own standalone front doors that can ultimately unlock the QuickBooks Online. So think of things like go payment or online payrolls. When you start to put that together, it starts to muddy what's the definition of the subscriber. And so at the end of the day, what we know matters most is that we are delighting customers and we measure net promoter that we are taking market share in every geography, which we measure very intently and that we are indeed accelerating revenue growth. And it\u2019s those three measures that we think are the best indicator of whether we\u2019re growing our franchise. I'll give you this as a little mindset that we're thinking about. I personally will be disappointed if we do not at least meet or exceed the number of net new subscribers we add in QuickBooks Online next year. Ad this year as I mentioned in my opening comments, we added 1 million net new subscribers. So that will give you some ballpark of what we mean when we say moderating growth, this is still very strong growth with a business that\u2019s accelerating. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Pfau : I wanted to hit a few on the tax side. So I guess just in terms of -- and Brad you mentioned that part of the guidance for the Consumer Group is more of a shift from the assisted category that do it yourself. So I guess what drive -- even though the tax codes become simpler now. What would drive those assisted customers into the do it yourself channel? And then I guess in terms of the way you guys thought about your -- the upcoming tax season, every time they make the tax code simpler, it creates more confusion sometime. So how did you factor in I guess consumer response to maybe being a bit more confused even though the tax code has become simpler? Thanks. Brad Smith : So first of all, we\u2019ve seen a secular shift in do it yourself over the past decade plus. If you just look at the numbers the IRS publishes each year that do it yourself category has outpaced the assisted category whether its tax or the CPAs pretty significantly. And then with TurboTax Live, we think we\u2019ve untapped a whole new source of growth, because we\u2019ve always discovered there were tens of millions of people going to an assisted tax prep method but add a simple unanswered question, hey, my kid just turned 26, can I still claim them as a deduction. And we found that with a touch of a screen to have the opportunity to have an expert come in to that experience answer that question allowed us to start to get more of those customers into the category. So as we look ahead we think a combination of two things. The government simplification to the tax process now has more people saying, I qualify for a standard deduction, why am I paying someone, I could actually be doing taxes on my own, I should consider do it yourself solution. And then for those who say, hey, I think I can do this, but I may have a question we\u2019re going to make very apparent with a lot of delighted customers who are willing to go after on our behalf and talk about how great the service is to say you no longer have to choose, you can use TurboTax and get the access to an expert, but you don\u2019t have to drive to a store, you can do it from the convenience at your home, in your pajamas if you want to. And so it\u2019s those two things that fundamentally give us confidence, and we have reasons to believe coming out of this tax season. And you\u2019re correct, anytime there\u2019s a change there\u2019s always a desire for people to say, gosh, do I have enough here to get this done on my own. And we\u2019re going to have competitors who are going to try to stir us to fear, uncertainty and doubt. But as you saw with the Affordable Care Act several years ago, a lot of people said, will this cause people to lose confidence and that was actually one of the greatest accelerators of growth we\u2019ve had in our franchise. Our team is poised to sort through that fear, uncertainty and doubt and let people know that we have an answer for them, whether they want to do it themselves or access an expert. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Your question please. Jennifer Lowe : Thank you. And first, I\u2019d like to say Brad we\u2019re going to miss you. I know you\u2019re still around for a couple more quarters, but you\u2019ve been a big presence for a lot of us for a while. But I look forward to working with you and Sasan, going forward. So just want to say that first. And maybe digging into -- based on Sanjit's question a little bit and around the strength that you\u2019re seeing in the online services revenue line. I know few years ago the message with the QuickBooks Online transition was the opportunity to get higher attach rates with payments, higher attach rates with payroll, since in the disclosures have been collapsed a bit and hasn\u2019t been as much of a discussion point at least on your earnings call, so maybe just circling back on your comments there. If you think about the acceleration there is that it, is that the original vision of QuickBooks Online of having greater attach rates around today\u2019s services starting to play out a little later than maybe we thought it would? Or is there something beyond that that\u2019s happening in that line item? I know you mentioned some of the -- their own front door\u2019s commentary. But I am just trying to contextualize that versus that being a similar ambition a few years ago that maybe didn\u2019t play out as we had hoped originally? Brad Smith : Thank you, Jennifer. And first of all, thank you for your kind comments. And you\u2019re right, I\u2019ll be here for a couple more quarters and then the junior varsity will exit and varsity will take the field, and I am excited to have Sasan stepping in. If you go back and think about our model over the years, it\u2019s been a razor and blade model. And the first thing is to get the razors and after that attach the blades, and we\u2019ve played that out very well over desktop era. As we moved into online, we are still aggressively gaining razors, we\u2019re opening new markets, we\u2019re going into the self-employed and now we\u2019re moving up into the midmarket with QuickBooks Online Advanced. But at the same time, we\u2019ve gotten wiser in how to really capitalize on services. This past quarter, online payroll attached to QuickBooks Online grew faster than 30% and payments grew faster than 40%. Now you introduce these new opportunities to have those services be the first experience for our customer, whether it\u2019s go payments for payments or his payroll and then unlock the QBL. And we think that's really going to give us an opportunity to accelerate our services business. So we are in a razor and blade business. We feel like there\u2019s a lot of game left in the razors, but we have gotten smarter and now we\u2019re entering that chapter where the blades are now become more important. And we do expect that you\u2019re going to see online services continue to grow and accelerate. Jennifer Lowe : So maybe just quickly to follow on that. If you look at how the landscapes evolved over the last few years, it feels like there is a growing number of payroll providers in particular that target the SMB space. So I am just curious if you can give an update on how you feel about the landscape there? Obviously, it makes a lot of sense for QuickBooks customers to use payroll. But in situations where you\u2019re leading with payroll, what\u2019s the competitive dynamic there given players like Gusto have gotten more visible over that time horizon? Brad Smith : Josh and team at Gusto great partners, good friends, we\u2019ve worked with them for years. But all of us see the same opportunity. Four out of 10 small businesses still do their payroll with a spread sheet and a calculator. So it is not a zero sum game, there is so much opportunity to help these small businesses get their payroll done much more efficiently and avoid the penalties and interest that come as a mistake. And then as you know as we moved into this One Intuit Ecosystem strategy, we opened up our platform. So customers can use our payroll, they can use Gusto, they can use ADP, any of those services will work with QuickBooks online. And two things happen in that regard; one is the customer is able to make the choice they want; and the second is that data flows into QuickBooks Online and the retention of the QuickBooks Online then goes up exponentially, up over 10 points when they attach a second service, whether we build it or one of our competitors built it. So we actually do this as a real win. And yes, the market is competitive but right now, we\u2019re all trying to get the customers out of spread sheets and into a digital solution that make sense. And then from there, it\u2019s always going to be up to us to make sure that we have the best alternative in the market. But if they use a partner, were happy with that as well, because that increases the retention of QuickBooks Online. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Brad, if the junior varsity team doubled revenue, we look forward to seeing what the varsity team does. I guess Brad just a question around why now you\u2019ve had three of your top corporate positions turnover recently. Obviously, great athletes in those positions. But can you maybe just address, I think there\u2019s some investors that are maybe a little unsettled by what\u2019s happened just with the number of changes that have happened. Can you maybe walk through your perspective? Brad Smith : Let me start first with the broader prospective. As you know as you\u2019ve seen us, we\u2019ve rotated leaders between positions over the years. I have the opportunity to run three businesses before I became the CEO 11 years ago, and that is by design. We fundamentally believe we grow and develop our bench by giving them opportunities to run different parts of the company and then that prepares them for greater things. These decisions that have been announced have actually been a multiyear process. We have a very regular set of discussions with both the leaders as well as the Board so say what the individual\u2019s personal true north and what are the business needs as we look ahead, and then we make decisions that basically get those all lined up. And so we have been sequencing these moves, and they've all been based upon a multiyear succession planning process. When it comes to me personally we all know that these jobs that\u2019s inevitable at some point you\u2019re going to have to say goodbye. The real art is being a part of that decision. And so for me when I set out 11 years ago, there were two mile markers that I wanted to put in place; the first is, is the company ready; the second is do we have an internal leader ready to take the seat; and the third is, am I ready. And I feel like with this year being a capstone that our company successfully has transitioned to the next chapter of growth in terms of the next leader, not only is Sasan ready having run everyone of the businesses more than I ran and also served as a Chief Information Officer, he has primed. And finally with me, I always hope that I would leave when I was more of an asset than a liability. And I think many people may argue that point that I may have already crossed that line. But I really never wanted to be that athlete that lost the step or couldn\u2019t complete the path. And I feel like now is the right time; I just feel like the Company is in a good place; we've got a great leadership team in place; Sasan has everyone's confidence and I learn from him every day; and I think this next chapter is really set up, so that's really why. And I would encourage anyone who maybe unsubtle to simply look at those who've assumed the seats because you know them all; they\u2019re 14 year veteran year; they\u2019re eight veterans; they\u2019ve been at Investor Day; you've seen them demos; and they have been a part of these decisions from day one; we run this Company as a team; and I really feel like this next chapter is going to be a strong chapter. Brent Thill : And just a quick follow-up for Michelle, just as it relates to your guide. I think you\u2019re guiding under the old rule pretty modest margin improvement. It's almost in four years now you've been hovering right around 33%. Some other questions we get is top lines is accelerating that's great, but what about the bottom line. When do we get to see the bottom line come through? Michelle Clatterbuck : We feel really good about the growth that we have in our guide. You\u2019re right. When you go back to our financial principles, we talk about double-digit revenue growth. And op income growing in the mid-teens, we want revenue growing faster than expense. This year, we came in strong with 15% revenue growth and 14% of op income growth. You see for next year for our guide; we are expanding margins; revenue is continuing to be in the double-digit range; and we have operating margin expanding by 10 to 50 basis points. So we feel very good about the guide. The business is really strong. And as Brad said, there is lots of opportunity for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much. And Brad, it\u2019s been a real pleasure over last 10 years or so, but I look forward to working more closely with Sasan, going forward. Maybe I can start Brad, just as you think about tax for next year, two things struck me. One was your guidance range, was actually for consumer was narrower than normal. And I would have thought that given the moving pieces in next year's season, you may have actually gone to the other way. So would love just to get your sense of how you are thinking about the different inputs into that. And then second just on -- as we think about ancillary revenues on Small Business online ecosystem. There\u2019s a big gap obviously relative to QBO revenue today. And if you compared it to the desktop business, I think ancillary actually got up to almost 2x, QuickBooks Desktop revenue. So I was just curious do you think there\u2019s that same type of opportunity as a multiplier, if you will, over time for the online ecosystem? Thanks. Brad Smith : Great, thank you, Ross. And it\u2019s been a pleasure work with you over this past decade as well, learned a ton from you and you\u2019ve always helped us think about the business in different way. Let me start with the Consumer Group data. Actually, the range is in the same zip code. If you look at 605, it\u2019s nine to 11. I know under 606 it looks nine to 10, but that\u2019s really just what nickels, it\u2019s basically the same shift and it\u2019s just a rounding thing. But also if you look back, there\u2019ve been years where we\u2019ve had a slightly bigger band, because we were in the early days with the how positives, hey, will TurboTax Live actually do what we think it will. And at work the Affordable Care Act that\u2019s coming out and even though we have confident. Do we have enough of a range to give us some wiggle room? What you should read into this range right now is nine to 11 is a little more typical, it\u2019s like what we do if you look under 605 with the other business. But the second is because our confidence level is high coming out of this tax season, we don\u2019t feel we need the wiggle room to broaden that range. We actually feel good about our momentum as we head into fiscal year \u201919. On the second one around online ecosystem revenue and services, you\u2019re correct. We went through a period of time where we had razors with QuickBooks desktops and then that number stalled out at about $4 million on the factsheet for a lot of years. And then we made a lot of growth by simply selling blades into that install base. And that drove two big businesses, our payroll and our payments business, to your point got to be about 2x what the accounting business was. We\u2019re not near that chapter yet. We still have a lot of growth in QuickBooks Online. We\u2019re just now entering the mid market space, which comes with a much higher ARPU. And we are still opening new markets internationally, and we\u2019ve got a lot of room to still grow in the U.S., with both Self-Employed and core QBO. At the same time, however, we don\u2019t have to sequence it like we did back in the day. We can also start to capitalize on the online services. And so yes, I believe over the long-term, you\u2019re going to see those services continue to accelerate and grow and become very meaningful. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see them get to the point where the 2x over accounting anytime soon, because we\u2019ve got a lot of greenfield with accounting and we\u2019ve got to continue to go out there and capture that opportunity as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jesse Hulsing of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Jesse Hulsing : Thank you. And Brad, it\u2019s been a pleasure and Sasan good luck. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re listening in.n First on the consumer guide, I guess, stripping out that apart. What are you thinking units versus ARPU? And I'm assuming that ARPU is going to be like it\u2019s a big part of the story again next year with Live. What do you think the different components that will drive the ARPU growth are? Is it mostly mix shift, you see potential to take price again this year? It would be helpful if you could break that down? Brad Smith : Yes appreciate it Jesse, and also the kind words. And Sasan is sitting here with us and he\u2019s anxious and excited to continue to deliver strong results in Small Business and Self-Employed for another few months and then I sit in the seat. So back to your question around Consumer Group. We\u2019re going to unpack for this group, at Investor Day, what we see as the long-term outlook for the Consumer Group at Investor Day. Ultimately, that includes four levers; what do we expect total IRS returns to grow; what do we think do it yourself category growth will be over the next five plus years; what do we think unit growth will start to look like; and then how much can you expect from ARPU. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of that at this point. But what I can tell you is our outlook on the growth of this business is higher than it was just the last couple of years. And we\u2019ll talk more about how much that will come from category growth units in ARPU when we actually get to Investor Day here in another 60 days or so. Jesse Hulsing : And Michelle I understand 606 can distort the income statement, we\u2019ve seen that with a lot of other software companies. I'm wondering on the cash flow side. What are your expectations for operating cash flow growth in fiscal \u201919? Thanks. Michelle Clatterbuck : In FY18, we had operating cash flow that was quite a bit higher, it was 32%. But as you look -- and that was because of some of the benefits we got from our tax benefits this year. We had an abnormally lower tax rate. But going forward, we would expect operating cash flow to more closely track non-GAAP operating income on a go forward basis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Brad, looking at the tax season this year. as you look at TurboTax Live, I don't think last year you really marketed TurboTax Live. As you going into this year, do you think that changes or do you think you use a similar strategy to which you did last year? Brad Smith : Kartik, you\u2019re correct. As we entered this last year, we traded it as a V1, and our campaign was more around there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of, but it wasn\u2019t that explicit about TurboTax live. As we get closer to season, we\u2019ll start to unveil more of what we plan to do. But I will share at this point three major learning that we know that we have an opportunity to capitalize on as we go into next year. One is much more effective in targeted market bout what TurboTax live is, which is the point you\u2019re making. The second is a better understanding of seasonality. We entered the year thinking that those that we want TurboTax Live will be towards the back end of the season, when there were more complex filers. We were wrong. There\u2019s just as many people upfront the early part of season who have questions as well. And the third is while we had a really good version one, we had an opportunity to improve the Pro experience who actually answers the questions for the consumers. So we spend a lot of time over the summer improving that Pro experience. So those are three big areas we\u2019re focused on. But we will absolutely be looking at our marketing messaging and helping create category awareness if there is a new way to do tax with the TurboTax Live. Kartik Mehta : And then Brad just your thoughts on with the new tax law changes. Do think there is risk in customers maybe trading down to the lower price SKU for TurboTax? And maybe how you might've taken that into account for your guidance? Brad Smith : Kartik, we do. In fact, we have incorporated that into the guidance that we shared with you. We shared that was a standard deduction more people qualify. We\u2019ve always had a category of customers that when they know that there is an opportunity to move down, they will. There is a group in the middle that we call it aspirational buyers. We\u2019ve all learned this in our marketing days if you have a good better, best product line up, many people buy the middle. And so there is going to be an inspirational buyer that may qualify for standard deductions that may get actually confidence knowing they could get access to something else. But at the end of the day, we factored that in and we believe the bigger opportunity or the tens or millions of people who sit in the assisted category, they\u2019re going to discover the same things and they\u2019re going to downshift into the digital solutions. And so we think when you net it all out, it leads to the guidance we have provided for you for fiscal year '19. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : On the -- I just wanted to get to the 606 numbers and look for -- 605 numbers, and look at the small business side. You talked about the acceleration you saw in fiscal '18 on Small Business. And it seems like you\u2019re basically guiding for the high end of the range to be backed down to the growth rate you saw in the year prior. And it feels like you saw acceleration, you've got the momentum and there is some underlying drivers here. Why would the Small Business growth be call back where it was before you put in place these measures? Brad Smith : Could you just repeat the second part of the question there, I missed it. Walter Pritchard : I was just wondering why -- so you guided on 605, the high end of your Small Business guide is 14%, which is the rate that you grew in fiscal '17. And you saw some acceleration this year. It feels like you put in place some things that would make that durable, and yet you\u2019re calling for decal of small business back down to at or below the levels you saw in '17? Brad Smith : Couple of things are going on there. .obviously, we\u2019re in the process of opening new markets, moving up into QuickBooks Online Advanced SKU and then building on the momentum and growing over some pretty healthy numbers. And so I often say internally, the best way to have a good year is to lap a bad one, and we don\u2019t have that luxury in this case. At the same time, I wouldn\u2019t over-read too much into that. There is nothing in the leading indicators that has us concerned about the growth rate. If anything, you might want to read in there or words that I\u2019ve used in the past, which as we tend to be prudent when we provide our guidance, because we want to make sure that we have the opportunity to learn and to adjust as we get into season. But when we get to the Investor Day, I had a feeling what you'll get the chance to see a strong momentum in Self-Employed QBO in U.S. and international, and a real excitement around QuickBooks Online Advanced, which is the enterprise version. And at the end of the day, we feel really good as we enter fiscal year '19 we've got the right growth drivers to drive growth. The rest of it in terms of the high end or the low end of guidance is really a combination of us being prudent. And the fact we\u2019re growing over some pretty big numbers and we want to give ourselves the opportunity to get over those numbers. Walter Pritchard : And then Brad on the international side, I guess we now have a great sense as to help pass that its growing here with the subs. But can you give us a sense -- are some of those markets staring to mature and are other markets starting to open up to keep that international growing well ahead of domestic, or any color there around that small business international would be great into '19? Brad Smith : The UK has really get a new stride, we\u2019ll be talking even more in the fall. But that business and that country has been performing at level that exceeded our expectations and they\u2019re only picking up steam. At the same time, Canada and Australia remains strong and we're very encouraged by the result we're seeing in Brazil, as well as in France. We are still in the early days of trying to get the product market fit in India. We have a powerful team of 1,100 engineers who live there and work on the rest of our products. And so they\u2019re committed to helping us found that product markets fit. So net-net, there is not a lot of change in terms of countries other than momentum forward in terms of how close they are to be able to get to the green light on product markets fit for us and then on the marketing. But right now, the results are strong I would call out the United Kingdom as being the real superstar right now and they\u2019re just continuing to build momentum. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Two questions, one back to TurboTax Live. Can you review for us how you felt the pricing on TurboTax Live was received by the market and maybe thoughts on the pricing of it moving into the new tax season? Brad Smith : This past year, we ran a lot of experiment in TurboTax Live. But if you net it out what tended to be on average, it was about $150, which was a premium to core TurboTax but a discount to what you would have to pay if you went to an assisted store or a Pro. What you may see if you go to turbotax.com right now is we enter what we call third peak, which is October extension season. You\u2019re going to see one of the lessons we learned this year is TurboTax Live in and of itself does not have to be a single skew. It can actually be a service that can be attached to the rest of the TurboTax line up. So what you\u2019re now going to see right now out in there and it\u2019s one of many tests we\u2019re running is you can now have the TurboTax Live assistance with TurboTax basic at around $80. You can take it all the way up to Premier and it makes that SKU about $170. And then of course you can even do it with Self-Employed, which goes up to about $200. So think of TurboTax Live now being an add-on service, more bundled in with the core TurboTax whether you\u2019re at the simple end of our tax filing SKU as to the more complex. So you\u2019re going to see us take a different pricing approach this year. Sterling Auty : And then one real high level question around small business. We\u2019re at the highest levels on the NFIB Optimism Index that is ever seen. Should we be thinking that we\u2019re actually at peak growth rates within that small business because of the environment so positive? Brad Smith : Yes, we are seeing very high optimism and confidence growth rates in the NFIB, and as you know having follow this for years. We don\u2019t put a lot of credence in those numbers, because we come to appreciate and celebrate that small businesses and entrepreneurs who are optimistic by design. One out of two fell in the first five years, there\u2019s always sure it\u2019s going to be the other person. And we love that about small businesses. The other thing I would tell you is while we certainly are at a cycle right now with small business formations and confidence are high, we also know that in most downturns that actually tends to be a catalyst or a boom for small business formation. We did have one counter cycle, which was the latest downturn 2008 but that was a consumer driven downturn. And their credit cards were maxed out they couldn\u2019t get any loans because the financial sector had melted. But that really was the anomaly. If you look back to all other recessions, small business formations tend to accelerate in the downturn. So while we absolutely think that right now we\u2019re seeing a lot of robust confidence, I don\u2019t think that gives us any reason to say we\u2019re going to have a drought coming up, because small businesses tend to be confident by nature. And even if things get tough, more people tend to get laid off from the big jobs and they go start their own small business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : When you think about consumer -- you\u2019re leading in the DIY category and getting share from assisted. But when you think of the long term opportunity on the consumer, you talked about try and do selling from a consumer app to more of a consumer platform. Where do you stand on that vision? And when should we think about some of those initiatives, like Turbo starting to contribute meaningfully? Brad Smith : We are excited as we talk about our consumer strategy; the first is of course to continue to extend our lead in the do it yourself software tax category; the second is to begin to transform assisted tax, and those have a lot of juice in them; then third part of strategy is begin to expand from a tax business to beyond tax and become a consumer platform, and Turbo this first year was in its first year. And Turbo had, when you look at TurboTax with customers, 23 million people consented to share their data in an effort to get access to lower mortgage rates, better credit card financing, refinance for student loans, and that was a significant indicator of confidence for us. And we really like the version one Turbo experience not only for the consumer but also for the partners. The partners who work with Turbo got an eight to 10x lift on their conversion, because the leads are so much more qualified and the data is so much deeper and richer. So the consumers are wining and the partners are getting a better lift. So we really think there is gain here and its early days. In terms of when we\u2019re going to see meaningful revenue, we haven\u2019t really baked anything into the guidance for next year\u2019s consumer business. When it comes to this, it\u2019s a very small amount. What we do think as we look three to five years out, this could be a real growth catalyst for us if we continue to execute well. Siti Panigrahi : And then on the QBO side, last quarter you talked some of the -- doing some experiment in terms of promotion and discounting. I was wondering if you could give some color on like what you\u2019ve found there and how much of that baked into your guidance. Brad Smith : Yes, so we\u2019re always running pricing and promotional tests. We run multi cell test, AB and we look for where we can get the greatest conversion, the greatest lift and obviously the greatest optimization of our revenue growth. We have learned somethings, we\u2019ve learned some important things about the bundles that we offer accountants and we\u2019ve also learned some important things about how long and how deep we need to make the core QuickBooks Online discounts for the small business, a lot of that\u2019s reflected on our Web site now. But you should also know we\u2019re running other tests as we speak and we may continue to adjust as we get closer to the fall. But I would just say that everyday our team gets smarter in both testing and pricing scenarios and discounting, and what bundles make the most sense. And that\u2019s what continues to drive acceleration in the business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Your question please. Jim MacDonald : Brad, on small business, could you tell us how you\u2019re thinking about price, especially with the services side? Brad Smith : Jim, it\u2019s been great working with you as well and you and I go back chapters even before this company, so I don\u2019t want to date you to one of us, but it\u2019s been a good run. We look at services and in some cases we chose to bundle demand to the subscription. For example, when you get to different countries, payroll we may not be charging for payroll in the UK, because that maybe what the market dictates or what we think is the right thing to get adoption of the customers. So really the answer varies by the market we\u2019re in. but today I would tell you that we see a real interest in customers attaching these services. And it gives us a chance to get them in with a pretty low friction point; they can come in and they can try it for free; they can begin to use it for 90 days; and then if they like it, they can go ahead and activate the service and pay going forward. But it really is a case by case basis, each one of the country and each one of the services depends upon what the market will support. Jim MacDonald : Then I had a follow-up for Michelle. I mean under 606 we've seen a lot of cases where the expenses gets spread out. And can you talk a little bit about impact of 606 on expenses? Michelle Clatterbuck : Yes, maybe the situation with some other folks when you look at 606, for us the only real impact that exists for us has to do with sales commissions. And it just had an completely immaterial impact for us. So if you take a look at back, you'll see that our expenses are basically the exact same under either accounting standards. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] for Raimo Lenschow. I'm just curious about if you could talk about ARPU for Small Business and Self-Employed, our math shows that it's been constant but there are some moving parts maybe in international growth and Self-Employed versus Small Business. Can you talk about ARPU at more of the cohort level if it\u2019s been increasing or decreasing? Brad Smith : I can and I'll share with you that at Investor Day, we've provided a pretty deep dive into what does ARPU look like by cohorts. In another words, what the self employed ARPU look like, what does it look like for core QBO in the U.S. what\u2019s it looks like internationally, what's Desktop look like, and then you throw it on to in blended. If I had to cut to the chase, each one of this cohorts the ARPU continues to get stronger and improve. At the same time, when you put them all in and do an average, ARPU looks flat and in some cases, it could be slightly down because the faster growing parts of the mix are the self employed customers who\u2019s tend to have a lower ARPU and the international units, which tend to have less attach right now, and so they had lower ARPU as well. But net-net when you put it together, each cohort is getting stronger. When you think about QuickBooks Online Advanced, which is the enterprise version of QBO that we\u2019ll be introducing here in the next couple of weeks in a stronger fashion. It's in the market now and you\u2019re going to see it continue to move up this line and get even higher ARPU. But net-net because of mix it's going to be a very false lead. That's why we ask to provide and stay focused on online ecosystem revenue, which they will keep then growing north of 30, this quarter it grew 43%. Unidentified Analyst : And Michelle, just curious about the datacenters that you guys sold recently. Has everything shifted to the public cloud now, or are you still getting double tax for AWS payment and maintaining some of your datacenters? Michelle Clatterbuck : Right now, we did sell our datacenter as part of our cloud strategy, the datacenter that is in Quincy, Washington. However, we do still have some of our offerings that are in that datacenter, we are just leasing it back. We've made some great progress over the last couple of years in FY18 that was one of the areas that we reallocated resources to so that we could accelerate the move. We are not all the way there. But for instance this year TurboTax was completely in AWS for second peak and we're now focusing a lot more on moving the QuickBooks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Ken Wong : So you guys have talked about the 3 million followers that turn off annually rough calculations would be give or take 8% churn there. How do you guys think that number can improve over time? Brad Smith : Well, we will look forward to sharing the actual retention results at Investor Day, but we have seen the opportunity to continue to turn that dial up and keep more of those customers. And with the TurboTax Live, we think we have a chance to really advance that even further. When you look at the total opportunity, there is an aspirational goal, which is we would like to retain 100% because when you get underneath the hood a lot customers leave us, short of those who are no longer filing taxes. The number one reason is their lives have been changed as something change in their lives that causes them to lose confidence. We think TurboTax Live is our biggest advance forward and really starting to say you no longer have to leave, you can talk to a CPA, a tax attorney and enroll agent right here on the screen and get that question answered, so we\u2019ll see how high is that. But right now our aspirational goal is to keep every customer that we get with the exception of those who no longer have to file taxes with the government. Ken Wong : And then, Michelle, as we think about the impact of Live going forward. To the extent you guys have upside on what you guys plan to execute there. What would the impact be on margins, if any? Michelle Clatterbuck : Well, I would tell you, Ken, that as we look at margin we really do look at that at a total business level, we\u2019re not looking at it -- at the total company level, not looking at it at the business level. We may have some opportunities with TurboTax Live that has been factored into our guidance for the upcoming year. As Brad said, we\u2019re really pleased with how it\u2019s performed. We think there\u2019s a big opportunity there. And I would say to -- so consider what we\u2019ve given with our guidance. Brad Smith : This year we had -- we\u2019re going to say, we had a rock and roll year in TurboTax Live and the margins in the consumer group were fantastic. So we do not see this as a dilutive business model. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your question please. Brad Reback : Michelle, maybe just a quick question on the Desktop business, so I think you talked about unit decline moderating to the single digits from 15% this year. Can you just sort of go over what's going on with the coverage there? Thanks. Brad Smith : So the Desktop business, as you know, we\u2019ve had customers who are ready and able to move to the cloud move-over. In fact, we had about 184,000 migrate this year. It\u2019s about 500,000 in total over the last few years. The ones that have stayed behind tend to be the more complex customers and they also tend to be QuickBooks enterprise. Now that we\u2019re moving QBO to QBO Advanced to starting our early journey to get an enterprise version in the cloud, we may open up opportunities for customers to move over there. But that business and the desktop continues to grow well. So what you heard in the forecast that Michelle provided is that we really are down to the point now where the customers on the Desktop, that is the best solution for them. And so we don\u2019t expect that decline to continue to be the mid-teens like we have. We\u2019ve moved most of those customers over to the cloud. And the ones that are staying are staying for a reason. Once we get QBO Advanced still then we may have an opportunity to get them over into the cloud as well. Unidentified Company Representative : If I heard that -- I think the new customers are all coming in on QBO, and so while we\u2019ve got a little bit of migration and those good customers staying, we aren\u2019t really restocking the pond on the Desktop side. The new guys are coming over to QBO and so you\u2019re just seeing some natural attrition in there as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is now open. Michael Millman : So the IRS seems to be very concerned at least publicly about under withholding, and I assume that they\u2019re very concerned about tax payer shock. Do you agree with this? And if so, will this suggest that there might be some more movement to assisted and TurboTax Live? Or do you see this also creating much more walking out of particularly out of assisted and to some extent generally less filing while people got to figure out? Brad Smith : Michael, that\u2019s a pretty deep philosophical question that IRS has put out there which is our people, basically paying the appropriate taxes. I can tell you that the entire industry and certainly TurboTax and our Pro products, works very hard to make sure two things happens; that people get qualified and access to the deductions they\u2019ve earned but then they pay the taxes that they owe. And we\u2019ve spent a lot of time making sure that those two things happen. I do think that with any tax change you\u2019re going to have people that are going to want to talk about it. Sometimes they talk about it to a friend or family member and we have that with our Live community in TurboTax. Sometime they want to a Pro, which is why TurboTax Live is so important. I can\u2019t see any major catalysts or shift that I think going to cause people run back to assisted, because of this question, the IRS that\u2019s put out there. But I do think it\u2019s the right question for industry to continue to solve that how do we make sure people pay the amounts they owe but at the same time get access to the deductions and the things that should stay in their pocket, that\u2019s what our job is and we have to make it very clear and very simple of people to understand. Michael Millman : Is part of it political and it\u2019s a one year impact? Brad Smith : For me Michael I have to avoid those political questions, because we serve all administrations and anyone who is in there. We have to make sure we\u2019re helping the country execute tax laws the way they\u2019re written and at the same time, make sure the tax payers get just the deduction they deserve. So I don\u2019t know what the motivation is. I know the IRS as a partner is a great partner. They\u2019ve been very objective. They\u2019ve worked very hard with the industry to make sure that we\u2019re doing the right thing. And I\u2019m not sure what the motivation was for some of the comments that you\u2019re referring to. Operator : Ladies and gentleman, I\u2019m not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith : Sure Latif, thank you. And thanks everybody for your participation and your questions, I know we\u2019re about 15 minutes over the allotted time. But your kind words along the way and many years are also deeply appreciated. I can say this. We are one year into the next chapter of growth. We really feel we found the new gear. We\u2019ve got some exciting new services that are coming up with TurboTax Live, QuickBooks Online Advanced and a whole host of others. We really see evidence that our ecosystems is coming to life, we\u2019re unlocking new value for customers, for partners and for Intuit. And I firmly believe our best days are ahead of us and we\u2019re looking forward to demonstrating that to you and everyone else as we enter fiscal \u201919 and beyond. So thanks again and I look forward to speaking with you soon. Take care, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

My name is Gigi and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Mr. Natoli. Jerry Natoli : Thanks, Gigi. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. I am here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO; Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO; and Sasan Goodarzi, our incoming CEO. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2018 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I will turn the call over to Brad. Brad Smith : Thanks, Jerry, and thanks to all of you for joining us. As we kicked off fiscal year 2019, we entered the second year of implementing our One Intuit Ecosystem strategy and we\u2019re off to a strong start through the first quarter. We delivered 12% revenue growth and exceeded our overall financial targets. Small Business and Self-Employed group revenue increased 11% with Online Ecosystem Revenue growing 42% in the quarter. Revenue from both the Consumer group and Strategic Partner group was also in line with our expectations. While this is a great start to the year, there\u2019s plenty of game to be played with our two largest quarters ahead as we move towards tax season. With that backdrop, let me share some observations on our business overall starting with our Small Business and Self-Employed group. As we foreshadowed last quarter, we are placing an increased emphasis on our online services to deliver greater value for our small business customers. Sasan shared many of these advances at our QuickBooks Connect conference earlier this month. First, with QuickBooks Capital, which leverages QuickBooks Online customer data to provide loans for small businesses, nearly 60% of whom may not qualify for loans elsewhere. QuickBooks Capital has funded $200 million in cumulative loans over the first 12 months since launching publicly. Customer receptivity has exceeded our expectations with 84% of QuickBooks Capital customers stating an intent to apply for a second loan in the future. We\u2019ve also introduced an innovative same-day payroll capability within QuickBooks Online, enabling small businesses to pay their employees on the same day if they process their payroll by 10 :00 AM Eastern Standard Time. This allows customers to hold onto their money longer and better manage their cash flow. Traditionally, small businesses have been required to fund their payroll two to five days in advance, so same day payroll is quite meaningful for these customers. In addition, we\u2019ll soon be launching next day funding within QuickBooks Payments, allowing small-businesses and self-employed customers to receive their funds the next business day, twice as fast as the two to three day waiting period they currently experience. QuickBooks Payments have also been redesigned, making critical payments functionality more easily discoverable for customers within the offering. We\u2019re also serving a broader range of customers with the recent introduction of QuickBooks Online Advanced. This offering is designed for the 1.5 million midmarket customers with 10 to 100 employees. Approximately 180,000 of our existing QBO customers fit this target profile, providing us with a significant opportunity to grow with them over time. While it's still early, customer feedback on QBO Advanced is quite positive and we\u2019re optimistic about the opportunity as we introduce additional functionality in the months ahead. Turning to the consumer group, the team is actively developing the next wave of innovation to better serve our customers in the upcoming tax season. Our strategy remains focused on expanding our lead into do-it-yourself tax category while transforming the assisted tax segment with TurboTax Live. TurboTax Live eliminates the traditional trade-off between the do it yourself solution or one-on-one advice from a pro. This innovative service significantly increased the confidence of our tax filing customers last season and it's only getting better. During the upcoming tax season we\u2019re launching several new features many of which were tested during the tax extension season in October. These include mobile access to an expert on demand, given that half of online tax filers use the mobile device at some point when filing the return. We\u2019re introducing a wider range of price points providing access to an expert from the simplest to the most complex of tax returns. Finally, we're providing additional ways for TurboTax users to access a TurboTax Live expert through their tax prep experience including the ability to submit a question and receive a response from an expert in 24 hours. Beyond these customer facing innovations, we've made several enhancements to the experience for the tax pros on the TurboTax Live platform as well. These enhancements include a new built in health panel and expand the case management functionality all in one place. We expect these new tools will improve the overall experience and productivity for the tax pros operating on our platform. As we shared last quarter, with regards to the external environment, we've long advocated for tax simplification and believe that anything to make taxes easier to understand is good for consumers. While the new legislation increases the number of people who will qualify for the standard deduction which introduces some trade down risk down risk from our paid to our free offering, in aggregate we believe tax simplification will be an overall catalyst both for the do it yourself category and for TurboTax growth as more assisted tax customers choose to adopt digital solutions. This expectation is grounded in historical evidence. Over the past decade many hypothesise that major legislative changes such the Affordable Care Act would create confusion and cause a shift towards more assisted tax prep method that simply didn't happen. In fact, TurboTax filings growth over this period of time has outpaced the tax pros growth by 600 basis points, tax stores by over 900 basis points and the IRS returns grew at a compounded annual rate of less than 1%. These trends reflect the secular tailwind of customers adopting digital solutions even with major changes to legislation. Moving beyond our consumer business to the Strategic Partner group, our professional tax revenue grew 6% year-over-year. We continue to focus on multiservice accounting firms that do both books and taxes, enabling us to drive our accounting success while growing our small business ecosystem. To sum it up, the momentum we exited fiscal year '18 with continues and our testing during the extension filings gives us increased confidence that we should have another successful tax season. With that overview, let me hand it over to Michelle, to walk you through the financial details. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we delivered revenue of $1 billion, up 12% year-over-year. A GAAP operating loss of $10 million versus a $35 million loss a year ago. NON-GAAP operating income of $102 million versus $65 million last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.13 versus a loss per share of $0.01 a year ago. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.29, up 71% versus $0.17 last year. Our GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter includes a $41 million excess tax benefit on the share based compensation. Turning to the business segments, total Small Business and Self-Employed revenue grew 11% during the quarter. Online ecosystem revenue remains strong with growth of 42%. As we shared last quarter, we believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy going forward is online ecosystem revenue growth which we continue to expect to grow better than 30%. We are pleased with the continued growth of both online accounting and online services revenue. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 41%, ending the quarter with nearly 3.6 million subscribers. Growth remained strong across multiple geographies with U.S. subscribers growing 35% to approximately 2.7 million and international subscribers growing 61% to over 880,000. Within QuickBooks Online self-employed subscribers grew to approximately 745,000, up from roughly 425,000 one year ago. As we told you last quarter we expect total subscriber growth to begin to moderate from as we shift our emphasis in the next chapter of the business model evolution. Desktop ecosystem revenue was down 4% in the first quarter, consistent with the mid single digits decline we indicated last quarter. Within the desktop ecosystem our QuickBooks enterprise customers continue to grow at a double digit pace in the first quarter. During fiscal 2019, we continue to expect QuickBooks desktop unit to decline single digits and Desktop ecosystem revenue to be roughly flat. Total consumer revenue was up 22% in one of our smallest quarters of the year. Looking ahead to the upcoming tax season we have an opportunity to address the needs of even more tax filers with TurboTax Live. Last year, the product contributed to a 2 point increase in retention, brought customers into the franchise at a faster pace than our TurboTax online offering and attracted first time filers at a higher rate. As Brad mentioned, we continue to expect tax reform to be a catalyst for the DIY category this season. As a reminder we [Technical Difficulty] provide a tax unit update in late February concurrent with our second quarter earnings release. We will also provide a final update in late April after the tax season ends. Professional tax revenue within the Strategic Partner Group grew 6% in the first quarter in line with our expectations. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investments greater than 15%. Our first priority to the cash we generate continues to be investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. Next, we consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We returned excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with 1.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased over 101 million of stock in the first quarter. Approximately 3.1 billion remain on our authorization and we expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share payable January 18, 2019. This represents a 21% increase versus last year. Second quarter guidance for fiscal 2019 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.55 to $0.58 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 to $0.88. We\u2019re also reiterating our fiscal 2019 guidance provided last quarter. You can find our Q2 and fiscal 2019 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I will turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith : Thank you, Michelle. Putting a bow around our performance this quarter, we are pleased with the strong start to fiscal year 2019 and we look forward to accelerating our momentum as we head into peak season. Our One Intuit Ecosystem strategy continues to take shape and I could not be more proud of the innovation and the results that our employees are delivering. As you know, this is my last earnings call as Intuit's CEO. Effective January 1st, I will transition to the role to Executive Chairman, as Sasan Goodarzi takes the reins. It has been a privilege to serve as Intuit's CEO for the past 11 years. I could not be more confident in Sasan and the next generation of Intuit's leadership team. As I look ahead, I have never felt better about Intuit's future. I want to thank you for your support over these many years and I look forward to the continued progress the Company will achieve in this next chapter. And with that, let\u2019s open it up to hear what\u2019s on your mind. Gigi, we will turn it back to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : I just want to follow up on the comments around tax in the trade down risk of tax reform, and Brad, I appreciate you reminding us of past examples in why you feel that this should be something you\u2019re able to navigate through and will benefit the overall category and TurboTax, but can you perhaps give us a little bit more insight into how you're thinking about the trade-off of unit versus ASP and the tolerances that you built into the model and guidance you've given us? Brad Smith : Great, thanks Brad, thanks for the comments on the quarter and we will be happy to talk about that. When we put together our guidance for the year, we factored in any of the potential trade down risk as well as the up side which is quite frankly much larger. When we think about the number of people using an assisted tax prep method, they are also going to qualify for the standard deduction and we will now have the opportunity to move into a do it yourself solution because the taxes are simpler, where they'll have an innovative solution like TurboTax Live where they can get assistance, if they lose confidence in any point of the process. So as you saw that fundamentally lead to a higher guidance for this year\u2019s tax season than what we provided last year as well as a more robust long-term outlook. Now in terms of our principles, we continue to strive across the Company to grow our customer bases as fast as we can because we know ultimately that will create a pipeline of growth over the long-term as they continue to grow and have increased problems that we can solve. But that being said we are in a unique situation right now as we launch TurboTax Live, which is creating an opportunity to serve $20 billion total addressable market that at to this point, we weren\u2019t able to effectively serve. And that comes with a higher average revenue per return, so when you introduced that to the mix even as we grow customers, we believe that you\u2019re going to get an uplift from that revenue per return, which is going to drive the overall performance of the segment. So, we would not be surprised this year, if revenue grows faster than customers and the tax business is going to be primarily because of mix. But I want to be really clear, our primary goal is to grow the do it yourself category and to grow our share in that category. And if we\u2019re not growing share, we don\u2019t consider that to be a successful season. Brad Zelnick : Thanks so much and if I could just ask a quick follow-up on QuickBooks. I know you said it before and you reminded us again that total sub-growth is expected to moderate some from here. Just for our modeling purposes and to wrap our heads around what that trajectory might look like any kind of parameters we should be thinking about? Brad Smith : Yes, Brad, we\u2019re really kind of step away from that, the reason being is first we think the overall health of the category and that business is really going to be driven by the Online Ecosystem revenue being greater than 30%. The other reason is we\u2019re moving into a chapter of apples and oranges on what qualifies as a subscriber. We\u2019ve a self-employed SKU, we\u2019ve QuickBooks Online, we\u2019re launching QuickBooks Online Advanced, they come with very different average revenue per returns, and now we\u2019re introducing the new front doors, the ability to have a standalone payments offering or a standalone payroll offering and the question will be what counts as a sub? And so our view is, look all those are solving important problems, that\u2019s why it's most important to focus on online ecosystem revenue. While we did provide us a little bit of a gating factor for people to think about is we will not be proud of our performance if we don\u2019t add at least as many net subs as we did last year. So if we think about that as a qualifier, when you think about the number of subs that we added, that\u2019s the kind of goal that we put out there for ourselves. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Brad, the economy is on everyone\u2019s mind and I am just curious, I think we all know how defensive the tax business can be, but can you give us a sense on the small business side what\u2019s giving you confidence as you look forward? It\u2019s obviously way too early to call, but what were the components that are put in that you feel good about as you look into next year, that\u2019s even if we go into a softer economy that you can sustain those headwinds? Brad Smith : And as you pointed out, our portfolio over 35 years has proven to be resilient and with the points that you called out, taxes are going to need to be filed regardless of the economy. On the small business side, we\u2019ve learnt to look past some of the more public facing indices, things like small business optimism because if that\u2019s going up, that\u2019s not a surprise for us because one out of two small businesses fail in the first five years. We're always sure it\u2019s going to be the other person. So, they\u2019re just natural optimists and that\u2019s why we love an entrepreneur and a small business owner. So, we look for more the leading indicators that the real health of their business and we look at things like charge volume. Are they hiring employees? Are they hiring contract workers? Are those workers working longer hours? Are they actually increasing the wages for those workers? At this point in time, we\u2019ve not seen any of those indicators weaken and so we still believe that there\u2019s a lot of noise in the market certainly in terms of the investment community and equity market, but we haven\u2019t seen that show up on Main Street yet, but as you might imagine and we shared this at Investor Day, we've already got game plans in place that should there be a softening in the market we know what actions we need to take to both help customers grow but also ensure we deliver on our commitments. Brent Thill : And real quick just payroll attach, the impact going forward seems like a big opportunity. What do you need to do to see that improve meaningfully from here? Brad Smith : Brent, we\u2019ve been focused on as we talked about in the opening comments, our online services, we're still very excited about the opportunity to get more people into QBO. We've also decided and found that it was an opportunity for us to get down a parallel path and get more of these attached services or online services. This past quarter online payroll attached to QBO revenue grew 36%, payments grew 34%, and we\u2019re really getting down to the blocking and tackling, simple design, that makes it easier to discover inside the offering, trying to be able to pre-populate data where possible so you can get to a benefit very quickly and those are the execution pieces, and then there\u2019s a new innovation, things like same day payroll, the ability to actually if you file before that 10\u2019o clock time on the East Coast, you can get your payroll done in the same day. And that is a big acceleration from what you\u2019re able to do with most other offerings in the competitive market, so that basically allows you to hold on your money longer and that\u2019s a compelling value prop for small business owners. So what we're doing right now is, improving our execution, simpler design, easier to discover, pre-populate data and also introducing breakthrough renovation there, alternatives don't have in the market we think makes our value proposition even that much more compelling. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard : One main question and a follow-up. Just on the online services side that business is growing quite a bit faster than the core QBO U.S. subs. I wonder if you could help us understand, what sort of prior drivers like payroll and payments are continuing to fuel that online services piece versus some of the new drivers, TSheets and QuickBooks Capital and other drivers like that. How much money you attribute to some of these newer drivers that we haven\u2019t been used to seeing in the past? Brad Smith : Walter, you actually hit the key drivers, you did a nice job of summarizing it. The bulk of this really been driven by our core payroll and payment, so we do have an nice upside with TSheets which came in, but that is not the bulk of that improvement. The bulk of that improvement is coming from improved execution, simpler design, easier discoverability, faster time to benefit and in the new innovation like same day payroll or next day funding and payments. And it's those wider two things, it\u2019s the new innovation we\u2019re bringing to market that we think is really shifting the playing field more in our direction and you\u2019re going to see more of that coming from us in the future, TSheets is a nice top spin on top of that. Walter Pritchard : And then, maybe Michelle you could help us understand tax seasonality, things like it's always tough thing to gauge. Maybe you could help us understand what factors you see this year, that would impact seasonality we move through the tax season in January and into the year? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi Walter thanks for the question. Yes, every single year, we have to look and see exactly how the season is going to play out. One of the biggest drivers -- so first of all, you have 606 this year, which I think we\u2019ve given some information last quarter and on the Investor Relations website to help you understand that a little bit more. The other thing that just comes into play every single year is the IRS opening day. And so, the IRS has not released when they are opening yet and so we\u2019ve make to some assumptions on that, so we will just have to see how that plays out. Operator : Our next question is from Shankar Subramanian from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Shankar Subramanian : This is Shankar on behalf of Kash. I have a question on the QBO revenue profile. It seems like the overall QBO revenue is growing faster than the unit growth rate for the first five quarters. But based on what you see right now, do you see that kind of trajectory continue on in the future and maybe just talk about the drivers, not just U.S. but international in terms of sat how the UK market will play off the rest of the year? Brad Smith : Yes, thanks Shankar, this is Brad. So, yes, we have continued to see an acceleration in QBO revenue and we suggest that that\u2019s the best indicator of the health of this business going forward. What\u2019s really driving that is a combination of things. First and foremost, we continue to be able to execute both new subscribers but also getting online services, up and running, things on payroll and payments or TSheets as we were just talking about. The second is as we bring customers in, we sometimes have a promotional discount for an introductory trial period, and then once the anniversary off of that trial period then their average revenue per customer goes up in that 13th month in a nice healthy bump. And so, we got a larger base that continues to anniversary of that add, so you get a lift in ARPU and revenues as a result of that. The third is, we\u2019ve been delivering more compelling value propositions and new feature functionality to customers so our retention rates going up. And if you can go back to Investor Day, you\u2019ll see we improved the retention rate of QBO as well, and so that continues to drive revenue. And then last but not least, we have opportunities as we look ahead to get smarter about our promotions. And so, we have been adjusting things like the kinds of promotions we offer to accountants, we found the sweet spot of what they would get the unit list, we\u2019re looking for without leaving too much on the table. And when you put those combinations together, it\u2019s attached services, it\u2019s the ability for us to have that anniversary group come off of their promotional trial period. We have the opportunity to do things that get wiser on our promotions and then we have improved retention from just stronger value props with new feature functionality and that\u2019s driving the revenue. I will continue to go back to our talking points that we want to keep that Online Ecosystem revenue greater than 30%. We are delighted to see it at 42% now and we\u2019re going to continue to keep our foot on the pedal and see how we can drive that. Shankar Subramanian : As a follow-up on the fact side of the equation, how do you gauge the competitive front, going into the tax season, anything that you see is early indicator about seasonal turnout to be or is yet to be seen? Brad Smith : Well, each year we always anticipate the best from our competitors we have really good competitors in the market. We often talk about the respect we have for them, they keep us on our toes and they actually improve the game for the end consumer. So, we expect a very competitive tax season as we do each year at the same time I feel like we\u2019ve got a really strong line up in place. We\u2019ve got a compelling offering that\u2019s going to be hard to match with TurboTax Live. Our team has got several things that they\u2019re going to be introducing on our core TurboTax product that we\u2019ll talk a little bit closer to tax season about. So I feel like we\u2019ve got our best foot forward and we expect to have a really competitive, but in our case we believe we have the chances to have another very successful tax season. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Your line is now open. Jennifer Lowe : I wanted to dig in a little bit on the QBO Advanced product and I think you talked about the subset of our customer base where it has the best fit currently, but I am curious if we dig into I think you said 180,000 users. How much of that is people who are outgrowing QBO versus QuickBooks desktop customers state that maybe wanted to move the cloud and didn't have the right functionality versus opportunity to go out and get new customers? How should we think about in that context? Brad Smith : First of all, we can look at evidence we already have in the market on the desktop of QuickBooks Enterprise on desktop. We have a 140,000 customers there with business it's north of 440 million both units and revenue growing double digit on that platform, and over the years, we\u2019ve come to appreciate, but that mix ends up being somewhere in the neighborhood of about 70% or stretchers, the existing QuickBooks customers who need to continue to grow and add functionality as they add employee. And then about 30% of what we call flinchers where the product is disruptive in the market and were priced at a level that we\u2019re able to get customers off of competitive platforms and onto QuickBooks Enterprise. So our going in assumption is we\u2019ve a 180,000 in the QBO customer base that look a lot like that 140,000 in desktops, so those are our target profiles and those would be the ones that we want to keep in the family and simply have them be stretchers. And of course as we introduce this product and we continue to add functionality, we think it's going to be just a disruptive than the cloud as it is for the desktop players and we think we will get some switchers from other alternatives as well. But right now, the best proxy we have is the evidence we already proven in desktop and that tend to break down about 70/30 split. Operator : Our next question is from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne : Brad, I just want you to touch upon sort of the QBO growth internationally anything to callout just in terms of any particular regions, obviously lot of opportunity in international. So just wondered if anything sort of popped up on your radar screen this quarter that you might now been expecting mostly for I guess for the good? Brad Smith : Thank you, Kirk. Obviously, we\u2019re proud of the results right now, 61% growth year-over-year in the international markets. We hit a escape velocity on our three core markets Canada, UK and Australia. UK continues to be the darling of the bunch, they are adding customers at a rate much faster than the competitive alternatives in the market, and we continue to see our net promoter\u2019s score or product recommendation scores advance in each of those markets. As we think about the next group of countries, we continue to have France, Brazil and India; and we\u2019re monitoring things like active use, product recommendation scores and we\u2019re seeing positive trends in those countries as well. They haven\u2019t hit escape velocity yet but they are getting closer. So net, net I would say if the three core markets we talk often about with UK being the belle of the ball in that group. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Pfau from William Blair. Your line is now open. Matt Pfau : Wanted to dig in a little bit Brad on your comments about TurboTax Live and having a wider range of price points this year, and maybe even just sort of dig into what the purpose behind that is? And is any of that competitive response to some of the tax stores potentially lowering prices for their bricks and mortar return filings for this upcoming tax season? Brad Smith : Thank you, Matt. So first of all, I will go back to coming out of last tax season. We had two big insights for TurboTax Live where our hypotheses actually were off last year, but we discovered some upside opportunity. The first was we had anticipated TurboTax Live would be a service that would be something that people with more complex returns would be interested in. But then we quickly understood that people who have more simpler returns also have areas where they don\u2019t have confidence and they would benefit from an on demand expect. So that lead us to, we need to have TurboTax Live not just as a bundle but actually as an add-on service for the simplest returns all way up to the more complex returns. The second thing that we discovered is we had held back on our go-to-market and advertising to the second half of season, because our assumption had been more complicated returns coming in second half, so let\u2019s put the marketing there. We've come to appreciate as I just said, that having an access to an expert applies to people early in the season as it does later, so there we have a more robust go to market plan that we got set up for the full season as well. Now just happens to be the competition has come out recently and talked about some of the things they plan to do and that gets me excited, because we already had our plans in place and I think this better positions us to be able to address what they are doing, while also take advantage of the opportunities we learned last year in tax season. Operator : Our next question is from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Ross MacMillan : Just on tax, one of the things that\u2019s probably happening this season is, we\u2019re going to see a higher percentage of people move from itemized to standard deductions, and I think our math suggests it could be anywhere between 8 million and 20 million filers could sort of come in to that part of the funnel. What are you doing to I guess make sure that those folks that may be moving to standard deductions for the first time are sort of educated around DIY and see the value of making that potential shift, if they\u2019re using an alternative way to file today? What's the cap -- what\u2019s the plan to capture as many of those as possible? Brad Smith : As you just pointed out, those 8 million to 20 million are spread across multiple tax prep methods, they don\u2019t all fit in do it yourself, many are going to be coming into the categories for the first time some are in the tax source, some are with pros because that\u2019s the way the parents may have filed, or that just maybe the way they\u2019ve historically been more comfortable because they wanted to have advise on a certain area of their tax return and then some are in DIY. So the first thing we\u2019re doing is, we\u2019re going to continue to make sure they understand that there\u2019s a better alternative in the market which happens to be TurboTax and that's going to be our go to market campaign where we\u2019ll have our message out there in all forms of media. The second is our word of mouth will work in our favor and we\u2019ve higher net promoter scores in the alternatives in the market that needs people talk about these are the kind of solutions I used to get my taxes done, and they\u2019ll tell their friends and family. And then third is with the introduction of TurboTax Live, anyone who historically would say it may be a standardized deduction, but I am still nervous for this reason they\u2019ll have the ability to come into our solution and be able to get that question answered so that they don\u2019t have any nagging question unanswered when they file. So think about it as a robust integrated marketing campaign, word of mouth continuing to work in our favor and then the network of experts available just in case you decide that you still have nagging question, you don't have to make the arbitrary choice to getting your car and drive somewhere, you can log in right from the solution and get your question answered on demand. And we thought through this and we feel pretty good about our assumptions, and we think we\u2019ve got a strong plan in place to be able to capture as many of those as we can. Ross MacMillan : And maybe one just for, Michelle, this quarter we saw very high incremental margin across the business for Q1, but for the full year you haven't really I guess aggressively taken up the stance on margins. What are the puts and takes that we should think about as we go through this year? What\u2019s the potential if you will for surprises on margin as we go through tax season given how strong the first quarter has been? Michelle Clatterbuck : Yes, we did see some strong margin in Q1, a couple of things I\u2019d just tell you to think about. We do sometimes have operating expenses that can shift from quarter-to-quarter, and we\u2019re seeing a little bit of that happen from Q1 this year -- or into Q2. We did give the guidance reiterated it so we do feel that that\u2019s a good place to focus for the total year. So that\u2019s really what I would focus on, as I would focus more on the total year, and I wouldn\u2019t get overly concerned with some of the movements that we may see between quarter-to-quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Turrin from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Michael Turrin : Going back to the macro for a minute, Michelle at the Analyst Day, you mentioned managing the balance sheet that can sustain all economic cycles that potentially allows you to lean in during any downturn. I wanted to take a moment to revisit that comment. I was hoping you could walk through your thought process of evaluating those trade-offs and potentially leaning into a tougher macro? Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks for the question Michael. There has been quite a number of questions around it that\u2019s why we thought it was important to address a potential down turn and what that might look like for us. For us, we really do go back to focusing on our fundamentals which are for us or our financial principles. We see us as enduring and that goes when you think about growing organic revenue and then growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We really are, no matter what we think about the economic environment, looking to deploy our cash to the highest opportunities we have. We do have a 15% ROI target over five years and that\u2019s where we continue to focus. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Scott Schneeberger : I have a question, three questions tied into one. In regards to some of the seasonality Michelle you address, but I\u2019m curious. There is a reason perhaps at least about tax reform consultation and about how you\u2019re going to be offering consultations for free to all. I\u2019m curious on what type of expense impact that would have in the timing of it Michelle? And then also, I think Brad said earlier something about marketing last year on TurboTax Live in the late season but learning that it's relevant to early season as well. So kind of tying all those together, how might that make that influence some of the quarterly pattern we've seen, and I realized you just answered on that, I think it was Ross question that there will be these variations. But just kind of the overall theme of what is -- where the marketing shift might be and where the human labor and expense might shift this year? Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks for the question. Couple of different things, I would say if, first of all when we look at the TurboTax business, one of the things we look at, specifically we were looking at the marketing spend. As we really look at a payback within the current year and that\u2019s what we focus on, we don\u2019t get overly focused on when this going to occur, whether its Q2 or Q3, it is around making the best decision for the tax season and making sure that we do have that payback within the current season. Brad did reference that last year we spent more in the late season this year. Again, we have to opportunity to look at the entire season, we mainly from different positions there. The only other things I would say you called out specifically at the tax reform consultation that we\u2019re providing this year that is right now is for a two week time period in November, believe it's 13th through the 27th of this month and it does give people a chance to call in and see exactly, how tax reform might impact them going forward. So obviously the impact to that would be in this current quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : I am kind of curious as you think about the strategy from very high level. We look back over last the couple of years, there were definite years that you targeted low-end returns as a way to capture market to your point to allow that to grow as they get to more complex returns and kind of grow in terms of the mix. Versus other years kind of using price to drive revenue, any sense in terms of what the strategy going into this tax season from that simplistic framework looks like? Brad Smith : Yes, Sterling, I think you just did a nice job of summarizing it. We went through this at the Investor Day. We have strategy plot or a plan on the page, it had five sort of solar system rings to it, but the first is to extend our leadership position in the do it yourself category. We conclude being competitive on free as well as introducing a digital innovation to the paid offering so we continue to grow faster than the category and takes here and do it yourself, and that\u2019s going to be a core part of our strategy this year. The next part of that strategy is to transform the assisted tax prep market with TurboTax Live, and we\u2019re very excited with the offering and we\u2019re really excited about the leading indicators we saw in October in the extension filing season. And so the thing that we introduced including access to an expert on mobile device, the ability to send questions in and get a response in 24 hours, or the ability for you to have different price points, so you could use an expert with the simplest return to the complex returns, is just three examples. And so those are the fundamental two prongs of this year\u2019s strategy. If you look at the rest of the strategy it goes beyond tax and to being a financial identity and expanding into things like Turbo and Mint and then eventually exploring global; but this year I would tell you it\u2019s a two pronged approach. Our go-to-market model will be with both do it yourself and the TurboTax Live offering, and we feel like we -- when we introduce our new product line up, it is going to be easier for customers to know which one is right for them and we think that our marketing campaign will make that even clearer. So we\u2019re very excited and I think what you\u2019re going to end up seeing is the do it yourself category continue to grow faster than the other categories. We plan to take share of that category and we think our revenue per return will probably pop a little bit because we\u2019re going to get a favorable mix shift with TT Live. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jim MacDonald from First Analysis. Your line is now open. Jim MacDonald : I just wanted to ask about TSheets and specifically and you\u2019ve owned that for several quarters now and just wanted to know maybe more specifically. How happy you\u2019re with that acquisition what you can say about that? And my follow-up is, does that make you want to do more of these types of small business acquisitions? Brad Smith : It\u2019s been great, and you and I\u2019ve talked about this -- we go back a lot of years and I appreciate your kind words as well. And to answer your question specifically about TSheets, it may be our single most successful acquisition we\u2019ve done in recent memory. We just had a Board meeting three weeks ago; as we do every other year I think you all are aware of this we do a retrospect of all of our acquisitions this time we went back 35 years. We looked at every acquisition in the Company's history, then we broke it down to the last 10 years and then we broke it down to the last two years. And we measured the performance of all these acquisitions against the original business case, we have presented to the Board and how they performed both strategically as well as financially. And I can tell you that our capability and learning from our scar tissue as well as our successes, which ones work and which ones don\u2019t, has increased our ability to bring these acquisitions in and help them be successful faster and TSheets is benefiting from that. They\u2019ve really helped us inside the Company, think differently about how to move with speed, and we help them with the channels and the innovation they were looking for to be able to reach the broader audience that they were hoping to get to. And so in terms of our go forward approach, our strategy remains unchanged and we know what problems we need to solve for customers. The question becomes do we build, do we partner or do we buy, and if the ultimate answer is buy then it gets held up against the 15% rate of return over a five year period like any other decision we make and that\u2019s what ends up helping us make the decision what we\u2019re going to buy. But I hope you hear that our play book has got more refined, our execution capability has improved and our board and we were very intellectually honest about our performance and we are getting better each year in terms of our ability to bring acquisitions in and try them in a success. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Millman from Millman Research. Your line is now open. Michael Millman : So following up on some of the comments. I was wondering, when you look at block talking about cutting its price, they also talk about cutting its price at $59 for in store and then hope of prevent at least, causing people to think before shifting to do it yourself. So one question is, do you think this is it going to have much effect. Secondly related, looking at the industry, do you see block is our competitor or you're more concerned with Credit Karma? And then I want to thank you for what you\u2019ve done over the 10 to 12 years. The Company has made terrific strides. And kind of my question following is that, as you think about what\u2019s going to happen over next five years, as you look at company from 30,000 feet. What do you see is going to be the major disruptive device that the Company shoots into the stratosphere? Brad Smith : Thank you, Michael, and I will start with where you left on in terms of the kind words. This team has performed incredibly well over 35 years and I certainly benefited from their expertise and their execution for the last 11 in the seat. So, it's been a pleasure to work with them in the field. Let me start with the first, virtualization our block and their decisions recently been more transparent on price and to roll out some of their approaches. I think first and foremost, I will go back to the ten year trend, because we\u2019re seeing a lot of promotional discounts and early refunds and refund anticipation loans in the tax source, but if you look at a 10 year period, the IRS returns have growth six tenth of a percent. Pros have grown three tenth of a percent. Tax source have declined 2.9% and TurboTax during that period of time has grown 6.3%. So what is the path and when they get to promotional battles this is often between the tax prep methods, it doesn\u2019t necessary change anyone\u2019s decision if we\u2019re going to lead the category and go to a do it yourself solution. I think the second challenge to that is, $59 is incredibly competitive when you\u2019re thinking tax store to tax store, but it pales in comparison to free when you think about do it yourself. And so, I think that\u2019s the first headline. The second is quite frankly, I mean sincerely, I had a ton of respect for each in our block as does our company. We had a ton of respect for Credit Karma for Tax Act and all the other players out there. Each one of them brings something unique and different to the category. So it will be hard for me to tell you which one we spend more time thinking about because we look at all of them and it used to be called plagiarism now it's called benchmarking. We look to learn from our competitors and we want to make sure that we have a better game, so we can get out there and compete in the market and earn the customers trust and earn the customers business. As I think to the future, this is really for Sasan and the leadership team, but I will tell you that we\u2019re fundamentally going to continue down the path we\u2019re on, which is a platform company that unlocks this ecosystem. And if you get underneath that, what is the major thing that is powering that? And that quite frankly is data that had been in a trusted and secured manner, stewarded by the Company and then we match that with artificial intelligence to machine learning to do amazing things for customers they could\u2019ve never thought possible. And so if I had to boil it down to anything, it is the power of data which the customers could sense, that we could match up with our science our algorithms and our data science to make magical things happen that I think will be the single biggest breakthrough that\u2019s a sign of the team all over and they\u2019ll continue to drive forward over the next five years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Wong from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Ken Wong : This one's for Michelle. What early starts Q1 and looking at Q2 guide and hope for just first half much better than expected. Just as a thought was purely due to the strength across your various pockets of your business? Or did you notice anything to suggest maybe moderate shift in seasonality to the front half of the year? Michelle Clatterbuck : And you actually, yes, you answered it in your own question. It is really as we look at the strength that we\u2019ve seen. You're coming off of FY\u201918 it was a really strong year for us across each of the pieces of our business, and we continue to see that strength come into Q1. And so, I would say it is more of the strength that we\u2019re seeing in the business versus any other shift outside of the just the normal shift you\u2019d see with the 606 change. So thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is now open. Brad Reback : Maybe could we get a quick update on where you guys stand on the transition to AWS and beyond that I know you\u2019re also using GCP on the data AI and machine learning side. Maybe how early we\u2019re in that process? And are we getting to the steep part of the gains from that? Or should we expect more in the future? Brad Smith : It's Brad. We\u2019ll keep that simple. So on the transition to AWS, by the end of this fiscal year, all of our consumer facing apps will be in Amazon Web Services. Today, we\u2019ve TurboTax Online there. It ran both its primary and secondary instance in the last of tax season in the cloud that was completely there. QuickBooks Online is now in AWS as is Mint, so we have some other services we will make sure in their by the end of this fiscal year. There will be a long tail of infrastructure and internal apps that will continue to move to the cloud that will take another 18 to 24 months, but all of our customer facing apps will be there by the end of July 31st, that\u2019s our target. And the second part of the question I have to admit I wasn\u2019t able to follow, I heard the data and I wasn\u2019t quite sure what the question was. Do you mind repeating for me? Brad Reback : Yes, I apologize. So I believe you\u2019re using GCP for a lot of your, we\u2019ll say big data type of work. I am assuming we\u2019re still very early on in that process and significant gains to be made in the future? Brad Smith : Yes, Brad, that\u2019s correct. So, you\u2019re referring to the Google Cloud Services and some of our capabilities that we have, working with Google on the data and the data lake as well as on the Amazon Web Services. Yes, we\u2019re early days and we\u2019re primarily right now working with Amazon Web Services on most of our offerings. We are running some experiments in a sort of a parallel path with the Google Cloud, but at the end of the day we\u2019re very early days in that regard, and we\u2019ll continue to share more as we learn more. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions. Brad Smith : Great, thank you Gigi. And let me just wrap up by reiterating that we feel very good with our Q1 performance. We\u2019re out of the gate strong as we head into our peak season. We\u2019re building momentum with some positive leading indicators as we came through these first three months. But as you all know, the real game starts now and comes down to execution. It\u2019s our team\u2019s favorite part of the year. We feel that we\u2019re ready. We've got a strong product lineup, a strong go-to-market game plan. And I want to thank you for questions, I definitely want to thank you for your kind wishes and I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday season, and we will speak with you soon. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Latif, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Intuit's Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Mr. Natoli? Jerry Natoli : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's second quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. I am here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2018, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's Web site at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics, and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our Web site after this call ends. With that, I will turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Jerry, and thanks to all of you for joining us. I will start by reviewing our results for the quarter and outlook for the year. I will then spend a few minutes sharing my thoughts about the future. Starting with the results, we're halfway through the fiscal year and continue to see good momentum across the company. Second quarter revenue grew 12% overall, fueled by 17% revenue growth in the Small Business & Self-Employed group, and 11% revenue growth in the Consumer group. Revenue for the Strategic Partner group was in line with our expectations. With this strong performance, we remain on pace to deliver against our full-year revenue and operating income outlook. With that context, let me start with tax. Every tax season is different, and this one is no exception. We believe the new tax legislation and the extended partial government closure impacted consumer behavior, resulting in a slower forming season. As a reminder, there are four key drivers for our consumer business. The first is total number of returns filed with the IRS. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. The third is our share within DIY software category, and the fourth is the average revenue per return. Our Consumer group strategy is to expand our lead in the do-it-yourself category, transform the assisted tax preparation category, and expand beyond tax to build a consumer platform. This is all in service of helping our customer make ends meet and get their largest tax refunds. Based on the latest IRS data, the do-it-yourself category is performing better than the assisted. Through February 8th, IRS data shows self-prepared e-files declined 3.2%. In comparison, TurboTax e-files through the same period declined 3.5%. We are confident in our strategy, and I'm very proud of our team. Let me share a few specific examples of how we are delivering for our customers this season. Within do-it-yourself, we've invested in delivering the best experience for our customers who file simple returns by including year-over-year data transfer for no charge in our free edition. We're already seeing in improvement in product recommendation scores. TurboTax Self-Employed is again part of our lineup this season, and comes with a 12-month subscription to QuickBooks Self-Employed, enabling customers the benefit by tracking their financials throughout the year. This product was one of our fastest growing offerings last season. In the assisted tax category, we are transforming the customer experience with TurboTax Live. We introduced a range of price points within the product lineup this season to offer access to an expert for even the simplest filers. For the first time, we're offering mobile access to these experts. We also improved the onboarding experience and tools for the approximately 2,000 pros on our platform, the majority of whom returning from last season. We're excited to see significant increases in Net Promoter Scores from the pros. Beyond tax, our consumer platform is aimed at helping customers make ends meet. With their consent, Turbo provides customers a view of their overall financial health by combining a credit score, verified income data, and debt-to-income ratio showing customers where they truly stand. This platform gives us the ability to connect our customers with the best financial products to save them money. Turning to Small Business, we've delivered another strong quarter in our Small Business & Self-Employed group, with online ecosystem revenue growth of 38%, again, exceeding our target to grow better than 30%. We continue to place an increased emphasis on online services to deliver more value for our Small Business & Self-Employed customers. I would like to share a few proof points that demonstrate our progress. We are focused on solving the most important problems for our customers by helping them get paid fast, manage capital, and pay employees with confidence. Within payments, last fall, we launched next business day payments allowing our customers to receive their funds much faster than previously experienced. We've seen an eight-point higher product recommendation score for those customers who have access to this product. Within payroll, we introduced next day and same day direct deposit to enable customers to hold on to their money longer and better manage their cash flow. We have already seen over one-third of our online payroll customers benefit from this feature. QuickBooks Capital has funded $277 million in cumulative loans since launching publicly, a little over a year ago. QuickBooks Capital leverages QuickBooks' online customers' data to provide loans to small businesses. Nearly 60% of which not qualified for loans elsewhere. Our QuickBooks Capital business has a default rate half the industry average. And we remain excited about this opportunity. Finally, we are encouraged by initial results for QuickBooks Online Advanced as we take our game to the mid-market to serve those businesses with 10 to 100 employees. We continue to rollout new features, including custom user permissions and batch invoices. The team is using customer feedback to iterate fast and add functionality. Within our Strategic Partner group, our professional tax revenue was down 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on multi-service accounting firms that do both books and taxes, enabling us to drive our accountant success while growing our small business ecosystem. To wrap up, we are pleased with the continued momentum of our Small Business & Self-Employed group and remain laser-focused on executing as we head toward the tax filing deadline. With that overview, let me hand it over to Michelle to walk you through the financial details. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we delivered revenue of $1.5 billion, up 12% year-over-year, GAAP operating income of $233 million, versus $194 million a year ago, a 20% increase, non-GAAP operating income of $339 million, versus $294 million last year, a 15% increase, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.72 versus $0.70 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.00, up from $0.84 last year. Turning to the business segments, Consumer group revenue was $461 million for the second quarter. While the season got off to the slow start, we remain confident in our overall plans for the year, and for Consumer revenue to grow 9% to 10% in fiscal 2019. IRS total e-files through February 8th are down 7.1%, assisted e-files are down 12.5%, and DIY e-files declined 3.2%. In comparison, TurboTax e-files declined 3.5% through the same period. As a reminder, we'll provide a final tax update in late April, after the tax season ends. Strategic Partner group reported $208 million of professional tax revenue for the second quarter. We continue to expect revenue in this business to grow 2% to 4% in fiscal 2019. Total Small Business & Self-Employed revenue grew 17% during the quarter. Online Ecosystem revenue remains strong, with growth of 38%. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy going forward is online ecosystem revenue growth, which we continue to expect to grow better than 30%. QuickBooks' online subscribers grew 38%, ending the quarter with nearly 3.9 million subscribers. Growth remains strong across multiple geographies, with U.S. subscribers growing 32% to approximately 2.9 million, and international subscribers growing 56% to over 980,000. Within QuickBooks Online, self-employed subscribers grew to approximately 845,000, up from roughly 489,000 one year ago. We continue to expect total subscriber growth to moderate as we place a greater focus on additional services, and penetrating a broader range of customers. Desktop ecosystem revenue was up 3% in the second quarter. Within the desktop ecosystem our QuickBooks Enterprise customers continue to grow at a double-digit pace in the second quarter. This further reinforces our interest in the mid-market customer with our QBO Advanced offering. During fiscal 2019, we continue to expect QuickBooks Desktop units to decline single digits, and desktop ecosystem revenues to be roughly flat. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits, and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15%. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. Next, we consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash in investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $177 million of stock in the second quarter and approximately $3 billion remains under authorization. We expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share payable April 18, 2019. This represents a 21% increase versus last year. We've gotten a lot of questions about the impact of a potential downturn. At this time, we're not seeing any evidence of a macro-inspired slowdown in our business. Charge volume trends remain strong and the number of employees being paid in our ecosystem remains on trend. Now, let me turn to our guidance. Our third quarter guidance for fiscal 2019 includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.03 to $5.08, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.35 to $5.40. You can find our Q3 and our reiterated fiscal 2019 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Michelle. With that overview of the quarter, let me take a step back and share my perspective on Intuit's future. I will start with what matters most to our customers. All of our customers have a common set of needs and those who've made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs and go into business for themselves have an additional set of needs. All of our customers are trying to make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save money, and pay off debt. For those who are small businesses, they have additional needs. They want to find and keep customers get paid access capital to grow and ensure their books are right. That's why our mission is the power and prosperity around the world and our strategy is the One Intuit Ecosystem, which focuses on unlocking the power of many for the prosperity of one. This strategy is a continuation of Intuit's 10-year transformation led by Brad from a North American desktop company to a global cloud company. As we advance our strategy, we're taking steps towards becoming an AI-driven expert platform. Let me unpack what I mean by an AI-driven expert platform. It's a platform where we and others solve the most pressing customer problems and deliver awesome experiences. It's about significantly accelerating our application of Artificial Intelligence, which progressively learns from the large datasets across the platform, and delivers the benefits customers seek with speed, and it's about solving the largest problem customer's face, confidence, by connecting them with experts on our platform. With that context, let me provide a few examples to bring this to life. When it comes to connecting people to experts, we are doing this today with TurboTax Live. Imagine the opportunity we have to expand live expertise across the platform to serve consumers, self-employed, and small businesses. It's our chance to digitize the service industry. For small business owners, we are focused on being the center of small business growth using artificial intelligence across our platform to accelerate faster funding in payments and to help our customer's access capital. Over time, we see an opportunity to better serve product-based businesses as they find and sell to customers across channels. We're also focused on helping customers make smart decisions with their money, by connecting our customers to financial products to make ends meet. This is our vision for Turbo, where we are increasing active use and engagement so we can offer value beyond tax with our consumer platform. Last but not least, we are focused on disrupting the mid-market with QBO Advanced. Our AI-driven expert platform will help provide what mid-market customers need at a disruptive price. We are excited about the opportunity in front of us and we are off to a running start on this journey. Before I close, I would like to thank our Co-Founder, Scott Cook, for creating such an extraordinary company 35 years ago, and Brad for the incredible foundation he has left behind. It is a true honor and privilege to lead Intuit. I want to thank our employees, customers, and partners for another strong quarter. We're pleased with our results through the first-half and look forward to the future. Now, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Nice one. Very nice quarter, guys. And thank you for taking the question. I want to dig into some of like the early returns you guys are seeing on the tax season, and maybe focus the question on two parts. One, in terms of sort of what the impact of the tax law changes have been, is it any early indications on whether it's actually sort of -- the simplification is drawing more people to DIY, is there enough numbers and they're gaining confidence in that? And then two, more specifically to TurboTax, how has the uptake of TurboTax Live been compared to your expectation on the TurboTax user, and I know you guys are promoting it very heavily. It's all over that landing page. Has the uptake been in line with your expectation? Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Hi, Keith. Thank you for your question. A two-part answer, your first one is, as the category champions for do-it-yourself, we're actually quite pleased with the growth that we've seen in the category. And we believe that with our actions, with our lineup, and with the tax simplification that it has potentially drawn more folks to the category. So, we feel good about what we see thus far. In terms of the uptake with TurboTax Live, as you know, there's multiple experience improvements that we made this year. One of them being that we've made it available across all of our skews, and thus far we like what we see, our PRS scores are up, both for the consumer and for pros, and we like where we are. Keith Weiss : Got it. And if I can maybe sneak in a follow-up for Michelle, when we're thinking about TurboTax Live, are you guys still comfortable that there wont be like any real gross margin impact from TurboTax Live, because I mean there is a real person on the other side of that live offering? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Keith. Thanks for the question on TurboTax Live, and you're right. We continue to be pretty excited about Live and the opportunity we have there, which -- and the opportunity is pretty big when you think about the assisted segment and what it gives us access to brining those customers in. As for our gross margin, we've continued to look at that, and we feel pretty good that that will stay around the 84% mark, over time. One of the things that's great about TurboTax Live is the price range for that, the ARPC for that is quite a bit higher than what we have with our normal TurboTax core product. And so even though we do have people involved in it, we're continuing to drive the efficiency there. Last year was our first year. And so, as you know, we've said before we weren't as efficient as we could be. And so we continue to work on that, but we feel good about it. We feel good about where we are from a margin standpoint. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Thanks so much, and congrats on a nice quarter. Sasan, if we look at the spread between consumer revenue growth and tax unit growth, it looks like you're seeing a nice increase in average revenue per return. What are the puts and takes on the mix that's driving it? And can you give us a sense of ASP or mix across the spectrum of TurboTax Live skews that you're now offering? Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Brad. Thank you for the question. As you know, we've got multiple levers of price, mix, and volume. And we actually like what we're seeing on mix. Our customers are seeing benefits in two areas. One is our Self-Employed offering, and two, the fact that we have TurboTax Live available across multiple skews. And we're seeing higher uptake in both of those areas, which is great, because it means that we're delivering more confidence for our customers, and they'll have confidence in their maximum tax refund. So, we feel good about it, and those are the drivers of it. Brad Zelnick : Okay. And I could just add a follow-up, either for yourself or for Michelle. It's great to hear the early success this season with TurboTax Live and the strong product recommendation scores that go along with that. How should we think about your ability to meet demand as we get later into the season, and avoid customers sitting in long queues and doing that profitably? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, it's a great question, and that's something that our teams prepare for throughout the year, and we have multiple different scenario plans as we're in season. I think the first thing I would start with is, last year our assessment of ourselves is that we deliver for our customers but we were inefficient on the platform for our pros. And this year, we did multiple things. One, in terms of onboarding the pros, this ability we gave them for scheduling case management. And so they are far more efficient and effective to deliver for our customers. So, we feel good about the capacity that we have, the usage rate that we have, and we have multiple different scenarios to ensure that we're prepared for the rest of the season. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thanks again, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Brad. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan of RBC. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much, and my congratulations as well. I have two questions. Just first on tax. One of the things, Sasan, we've noticed is it appears that the way that the forums changed, and the way your product offerings change might mean that more prior year free-filers may actually become paid filers. And I was wondering if, I guess two things on that. One is, is that a fair assumption or a fair assertion. And then secondly, what are the implications for unit share given that part of the DIY category is free as opposed to paid? And is there potentially some sort of mix shift towards paid and away from free as you think about the mix this year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, thank you, Ross. Great question, just one -- as a reminder, the four levers in the business are IRS -- number of IRS returns, it's driving growth into DIY category. And then we want to be able to take share in the category. And then last but not least, it's about revenue per customer. And this year, we lined up our free offering. We wanted to deliver the best free offering, so we lined it up with the IRS 1040, and included a number of things to make it really an awesome offering, inclusive of year-over-year data transfer. But by the way we defined our offerings there are a number of customers that would look to our paid offerings for the benefit. And we are actually seeing some of that uptake, and feel good about what we are seeing. At the end of the day, what matters for us is, as the champions of the category is growing the category, and ultimately putting customers and the right products, and we feel good about what we're seeing early in the season. Ross MacMillan : Great. And maybe one other one just to follow-up, there was some commentary around, I guess, the test product, like bookkeeping that was out there. And I know it's not a product that's in market yet, but I was just curious of kind of your thoughts around that, and maybe if there's anything just to talk about on a potential product in the future? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, I think you're asking about QuickBooks Live. Let me just take a step back and setup some context. When you think about what I shared earlier around an AI-driven expert platform. There are common needs across all of our customers that we serve, consumer, self-employed, and small businesses. And one of the biggest problems that customers face is confidence, and so one of the most important areas that we are focused on is connecting people with experts on our platform. And we've been doing some testing to learn what's important to small businesses, what's important to bookkeepers, enrolledagents and accountants, and running a test to make that connection. And so far, we like what we see in the test, because ultimately it's a two-sided platform. It's about serving small businesses, but it's also helping enrolled agents, CPAs, and bookkeepers growth. And we're seeing -- we like what we see so far in our early reads. Ross MacMillan : Great, thank you. Congrats again. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your question, please. Kirk Materne : Yes, thanks very much. So, Sasan, I want to maybe shift over to QuickBooks Online really quick, and just talk about QBO Advanced. You mentioned you feel good about the progress there thus far. Could you just talk about sort of who you expect to be sort of the initial customers for that, meaning we are to expect that there's an opportunity to maybe keep customers that were sort of turning off to a product that more for midsized customers as well as actually bring on new customers on to the platform. I guess is there a balance you're expecting in the near-term on that? And then I just had one follow-up for Michelle. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Kirk. Thank you for your question. And let me just start with some context into the way we think about this space. First of all, the way we draw the line is small businesses with employees between 10 to 100, and that generally the challenge in this space is that these customers are over-served and they overpay. And there's an opportunity for us to really serve these customers. Now the good news is, we do this today with Desktop Enterprise, we have well over 140,000 customers, it's over a $440 million business that's growing double digits. And we've made the decision now because we are ready to ultimately build out the platform in the cloud. And we believe that there is a big opportunity to serve these customers, first it's ensuring that we can be there for our existing customers. When we look at Desktop Enterprise, it's been 70% stretchers and 30% new, but as we look at QBO Advanced and really disrupting mid-market, we want to be hunters and nurturers. And so we want to make sure that we not only deliver for our existing customers as they grow but we also want to make sure that we begin to go after new acquisitions. I would just remind us that we are very early. We know how to play in this space. But now we're building the platform in the cloud and it's not just about the platform, but also the services that we need to deliver. And so very early, but we're pleased with the early results. Kirk Materne : Okay, that's helpful. And then Michelle, obviously, you know, really nice bead on operating margins that seem to flow through just on the top line B, but given the tax season sort of evolved a little bit slower, was there any spend that shifted into the third quarter may be from the second quarter as a result of that or was that just -- served the natural leverage of the model showing up in terms of the operating margin earnings outside this quarter? Thanks. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Kirk for the question, yes, with a slow forming tax season and just our normal operations of the business, we do see expenses that tend to shift from one quarter to the other. We tend not to get overly focused on that. We really do focus on the total year when we think about margins. And so I would stay focused on the guide we've given for the year and not get too caught up in the quarterly movements. Kirk Materne : Fair enough, thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. The question, please. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good afternoon and nice work. My first one, it's similar to Ross' earlier about the tiers in TurboTax, but specifically to the changes in tax reform. I'm just curious if the -- obviously, with the tiered category there're changes in robustness on your end, but are you seeing a lot of change from -- we'll call it trade down from itemized to standard deduction, and how are you handling that? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Scott, thank you for your question. I think, back to the context that I said earlier, tax simplification is really good for consumers and in fact with us being the category champions and the way we are promoting how easy it is to do taxes yourselves we're seeing a growth in the category. Now, with respect to where customers fit across the different lineup, it's playing out exactly within kind of the realm that we assumed in terms of, one, those may trade up because of TurboTax Live and the confidence that they're looking for. But also those that potentially used to pay, but now need to be free. So what we're seeing is very much in line with what we expected. Scott Schneeberger : All right. Thanks for that, Sasan, and then as far as competitive behavior -- a lot of rate changes and tier complexity changes from everyone this year, I'm just curious if you're seeing -- obviously, we don't have a IRS through middle of February. You had to go back a week on that. So how do you think you compare -- I know it's a handicap, not having seen that yet, but through midyear, do you think that anyone is stepping out ahead or behind or falling back in the -- in any of the categories in the tax base just through competitive behavior? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, thank you, great question. You know, having lived in TurboTax land myself for three years, this season is like all other seasons. Everybody -- we respect our competitors, they're putting their best foot forward. Really good products, really good marketing and I would just say we like what we see so far. And just as a reminder for every point the IRS grows our revenue is up about one. For every point the category grows our revenue is up 3 and we are very focused on growing the category and we like what we see so far. Scott Schneeberger : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. 12% growth from the first half of the year, yet you're guiding for D Cell to get to eight to 10 for the back half. I'm just curious how you think about the back half and the differences that you faced. Obviously, a big comp from last year, but any other factors that you're paying attention to that we should be cognizant of? Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Brent, a very legit and deserved question, our principle is we guide to the year and we guide to the quarter. And of course as you just articulated both in Q1 and Q2 we delivered 12% top line growth and of course you know, our guidance for Q3 and we're very focused on delivering for our customers in Q3, and delivering the guidance that we've given you all and then we'll step back and look at guidance for the rest of the year. As you can imagine our third quarter has more than doubled the revenue we just delivered, and we want to make sure that we are laser focused at executing that. So nothing -- there's no new dynamic other than we guided for the year and then we guided for the quarter. Brent Thill : Okay. And Michelle, the buyback's down 49% in the first half of the year and I know that you still have $3 billion authorized, can you just give us a sense of any change in capital allocation here in terms of how you're thinking about the balance of where you're going? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Brent, thanks. Thanks for the question. In Q2, as I mentioned we bought back $177 million worth of stock which was up from 101, a $101 million in Q1, and you know we really -- there has not been any change in our capital planning decisions. We apply our financial principles and so we look at investing in the business to drive growth. As I mentioned in acquisitions and then we look at the -- at buying back shares and paying dividend. And so I would say we're pretty happy with where we are over the last four years. We've returned about $6 billion to shareholders and so we feel pretty good about where we are right now. Brent Thill : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much. Congrats to Sasan on taking over as CEO of Intuit. I had a question with respect to the tools that are available to Intuit to improve retention in the TurboTax business and also the QBO business? Thank you very much, that's it from me. Sasan Goodarzi : Kash, thank you for your question and your kind words. Do you mind just repeating your question, because you cut in and out? I didn't hear the whole question\u2026 Kash Rangan : Absolutely. We're going into a tunnel, happy to do that. The tools that are available to Intuit -- tools of strategy that are available to Intuit to improve the retention rate in TurboTax and the QBO businesses. Sasan Goodarzi : Got it, got it. Very helpful, thank you for repeating it. I would just start with -- our approach is that all of our products are instrumented. So we look at the data across all of our products, we look at what customers are using. We look at voice of the customer, we look at product recommendation scores. And that really helps us hone in on where we are delivering for customers, where we need to improve the experience, and that actually is what informs in the very near term a roadmap while separately we have longer term strategic roadmaps. So I would say really the uber tool is that our products are instrumented. We look at the data, we look at voice of the customer, we look at product recommendation scores. And those combined with how we observe customers is what informs what we do to ensure that we improve retention across our platform. Kash Rangan : Particularly on TurboTax, is there any way to how we use the light product for retention and potentially upsellers to make a better and more holistic experience, so issue that we've had in the past of people are dropping out because there is competition and whatnot. How do you think about that lever? That's it. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, got it, very helpful. That's actually one of the reasons why we are so excited about TurboTax Live, because it really goes after the heart of what matters most to our customers, which is that one nagging question that they had. They just bought a house or they sold the house or they just got married or they just had a child or they made a new investment and what are the implications of that to my tax return and that is what's so exciting about Live, because now customers can ask a question. We've improved the experience so they can get real-time answers so they can get asynchronous answers. And that had proved last year to be not only a conversion but a retention tool and we're seeing the same this year. Kash Rangan : Wonderful, thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Kash, and I apologize I didn't hear your question the first time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Your line is open. Jennifer Lowe : Great, thank you. I think we've all seen the press talking about don't expect as big a refund this year or people who's got refunds in the past are now owing money and you know, that may be one of the reasons we're seeing a slower start to tax season because the people getting a big refund file first. But I'm just curious, you know, as you see to the extent this trend is shaping up where people are getting smaller refunds or potentially owing more money than they have in the past, how is it impacting behavior? Does it change price sensitivity, do they want a second opinion and maybe do things like TurboTax Live, I'm just curious to get your takes on that phenomena. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, hi Jennifer, thank you for the question. What we've learned through the years and this is all through data is that ultimately customers will pick the right product that's right for them. If the refund surprises them it becomes a confidence question and that's where they need help. Did I do my taxes right, did I answer the questions the right way, which is by the way and the reason why TurboTax Live is so important for our customers, so they can get that nagging question answered, inclusive of, hey, I expected more on my refund, why is it different. With that context, we don't share our year-over-year refunds for our customers, but IRS shared it through February 8th and it was down 8.7% per customer and we'll just have to see how the rest of the season plays out, but it does not impact, back to your question, which product customers pick and their sensitivity, because once they pick a product, they have confidence in the product, they are just more focused on do I have confidence in my refund. Jennifer Lowe : Great. And just sort of a second question, it's similar vein. You know, the same press reports talk about the increased complexity even for the professionals this year, and if we look at the relative delta between the self-prepared e-files and the professional e-files, certainly, that seems to indicate share gains for the DIY category, but I guess, you know, how do you think about the potential durability of that gap. Is there any sense of whether pros are just taking a little longer this season to get those filings in, because they're grappling with new legislation or do you think that's something that could persist as we move through the next couple of months? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : I think there are two big levers. One is we have digital tailwinds. More and more customers want to do things themselves versus have somebody else do it for them. However, when they need the help, they want to make sure that that expert is there. So one, there are tailwinds. I think the second thing I would say is in addition to the tailwinds is we view ourselves as the category champions to drive the category growth, which is why we are focused on not only expanding our lead in the Do It Yourself category, but transforming the assisted category, which in essence gives folks more confidence to do it themselves, because they know there's going to be a human there on the other side to help answer their question. And so I would say those are the two drivers as to we believe that over time that will persist. Jennifer Lowe : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Please, go ahead. Josh Beck : Yes, thank you taking the question. I wanted to ask in the consumer segment I know that you are -- Investor Day you had highlighted 25 million registered users across mint and turbo, and I know it's early in the season but can you give us a sense of how those initiatives are tracking thus far? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Hi, Josh, thank you for your question. First of all, I'll go back to -- our focus is to make -- to help our customers make ends meet. And really the vision for turbo is to ensure that we are matching our customers with the best financial products. And we've got four verticals that we are focused on, investing, lending, and mortgage just being three of the four. And we have 25 offers where we match our customers with their consent of data to the financial products. And we in fact, this year introduced 20 new features. All in service of helping our customers make ends meet and ultimately helping our partners thrive. So far with the early data, again, we like what we see, we'll share those results at the Investor Day this year coming up, but we like what we're seeing and what we're learning. Josh Beck : Great. And I had a follow-up around online services. That's been, I think a nice, positive upside surprise. You had some nice updates on capital and payment and payroll. I'm just wondering if you unpack that are there certain areas that are maybe coming in ahead of your expectation or you're becoming more excited about as you make more inroads on the services front? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, we are very proud of the team, because they are very laser-focused on what matters most to our customers, which in this case is helping them get paid fast, helping them get access to capital and helping them pay employees but actually hold on to as much money -- as much as their money if they can before they have to pay their employees and ultimately when it comes to time tracking which drives more accuracy in how you pay your employees. And I will just share with you that our teams have been very focused on those customer problem and improving the experience and looking for way to get the money into our customers pockets faster or helping them hold on to their money longer and I think some of the innovation that we launched and we talked about earlier whether it's faster funding and payments or same day and next day payroll where customers get the hold on to their money a little bit longer is all in service of our teams being very focused on what matters to customers and just accelerating both the innovation and our marketing efforts and that's something that we would foresee continuing. Josh Beck : Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Merwin : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Just in terms of international sub growth line I think it was not a really strong quarter up over 50% year-over-year and I know U.K. has been an area of strength more recently for you all. And I guess with the MCD legislation coming into effect in April. Should we expect this tailwind to continue or is that sort of something that might taper off. How should we think about that continuing unless we move throughout the - and I have a follow up. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Chris, thank you for your questions. We are very pleased with the team's performance on international and it grew about 56% this quarter driven by several countries U.K., Australia and Canada. And making tax digital we believe we'll actually be a contributor to continue growth and the reason it will create a digital tailwind for small businesses to - have to change their behaviors in essence for things like invoicing. So we view that as a potential catalyst to maintain the growth. Chris Merwin : Okay, great. And the follow up is just on TurboTax e-filers, it looks like they were down a little bit more category obviously very early in the tax season, but just curious how you're thinking about share again in 3Q and again what you contemplated at guidance? Sasan Goodarzi : Again just as a quick refresher, we look at IRS growth growing the category and then by growing shares, and as we plan out our game plan for the season, we do it in season parts. So thus far we are where we expected to be and we have a game plan for the rest of the season that we're excited about. Chris Merwin : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim. Your line is open. Ken Wong : Great. Sasan at Analyst Day, one of the big goals you guys laid out was to improve conversion at the top of the funnel in terms of customer traffic. I'm wondering if you guys have any early trends that you could share there in terms of the success on that front. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, hi, Ken. Thank you for your question and that is a really a big focus for us as the company because we get the customers coming to us the opportunity we have is to improve that. And we are running multiple different experiments. We continue to run experiments in TurboTax actually improve traffic to login and we're also doing the same thing in QuickBooks. Our user -- an example for QuickBooks as a reminder, people come to us from many different reasons in QuickBooks, they may come to us for invoicing, they may come to us for payroll, they may come to us just to get organized and we've been shifting from really a quickbooks.com that is just generic size to having landing pages that asks a couple questions from customers, understand their intent and take them right to what they're looking for because they come to us for many different reasons. We in fact had multiple tests running right now and we've been -- and we will continue to rollout the winners. So we like our progress here and I would tell you that we will never be satisfied because we have so much room for improvement and we see a lot of opportunity in this area. Ken Wong : Got it. And then a follow up for Michelle, you guys mentioned that the plan was to start spending marketing dollars at the start of tax season it's a little earlier than last year. Can you maybe comment on how effective that's been and then whether or not you guys mind considering putting a little more gas on the fire if that has been affected? Michelle Clatterbuck : Sure. First, thanks for the question, Ken. First, have you seen our advertising? Ken Wong : I have seen your advertising, it's -- that's why I am QuickBooks customer and TurboTax customer. Michelle Clatterbuck : You liked it? Ken Wong : Well, I saw the -- see which one was it, well, can't remember at this moment, but yes, I think it's effective. It's truly little Web site, double-check. Michelle Clatterbuck : Well, good, good, good. Well you know what we found the same thing. So our big push there with our marketing dollars is really we want to be where our customers are, so that's important to us and when we look at marketing and whether we should spend more or not it really is around some marketing spend driving the outcomes that we want and so on the QuickBooks side we tend to focus on LTV on the TurboTax side we tend to focus on when you're paying back and so that enables us to be able to make different research allocation decision because as you get know, we manage margins the company level and so we're always looking at how to best play funds to deliver better outcomes. And so right now, with the metrics we've seen so far, we are pleased with how we're selling. I am so excited to have, with QuickBooks and with our TurboTax ads. Ken Wong : Got it. Thanks Michelle. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I had two quick questions, first on QuickBooks on the international. You mentioned about the success you had there. Can you talk a little bit about Brazil and France and maybe India situation where we were working on markets of readiness, and I am aware of the U.K. strength but just wanted to see out how those regions are doing? And I had one follow-up. Sasan Goodarzi : Hi Raimo, thank you for your questions. Just for context there is six countries that were in outside of the U.S. it's U.K., Canada, Australia and of course the other three that you asked about France, Brazil, and India. I'll hit on each of them very quickly. In Brazil, we really focused the teams on the compliance market. It's actually a large enough market. It's almost two UK's and we like the progress that we see both our active use and PRS is going up. In France, it's important to remind ourselves that it is extremely early in the shift to the cloud. We are very focused on a few key problems one of them being document exchange between accountants and small businesses, things we see capture. We like the progress that we're seeing there and the product markets fit and we're seeing increased active use and PRS, but it's very early in the shift to the cloud. Again, France is where the United States was 25 years ago in terms of just where it is and moving to the cloud. And then last but not least, India is just going through a significant digital transformation with the government getting involved, and we are very focused on tech savvy businesses. We are making progress in India, but it is not the same rate as what we're seeing in Brazil and France. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. And then one follow-up, can you just remind us -- a lot of your business moved to AWS and I am expecting the tax season what's going to meet the scale and its scaling. Can you remind us like where you are, where is the duplications versus where you can immediately fully on AWS already? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, we are very excited about the shift at AWS it helps with better tools, better automation for our developers so they can be a far more productive and drive a much more innovation. We expect by -- well, first of all, let me start with most of our large caps already on AWS and we expect by FY'19 middle of FY'20 for most of the other services to be on AWS. There is always going to be delivery services that will take more time, but for the most part will be over the bridge. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Congratulations. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Michael Turrin : Hey, good afternoon, thanks. Following up on some of the online services commentary that number continues to accelerate, just hoping you could expand a bit more around what attached those additional products can do for our proven retention rates in the small business segment over time. Sasan Goodarzi : I guess, Michael, thank you for your question. Maybe just a quick repeat of what I mentioned earlier. We are very focused on what matters most to our customers, which is around getting paid, around capital paying employees and contracting and we like what we see and the progress that we see. I think what's most important for you all to remain focused is on our online revenue being North of 30%. We don't manage the business or set goals around ARPU, but ultimately what's most important to our customers and ensuring that we deliver what we've committed to you all. And so I would focus on the 30% revenue growth, online revenue growth. Michael Turrin : Great. And then on Self-Employed, you added 100,000 subs there during the quarter, could you just help us parse through a bit more how much of that was driven by synergies with TurboTax early in the season, whether there are some additional factors that might be helping drive those synergies? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, absolutely. Well, first of all, we're excited about almost adding 400,000 compared to this time last year and really helping the needs of the Self-Employed. We will break out where it came from at Investor Day, but right now it's not something that we will break out but we like the progress that we're making both going directly to Self-Employed and what we're seeing across the ecosystem across the TurboTax channel. Michael Turrin : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Just Sasan for you, on traffic, I know at the Analyst Day you talked about how traffic TurboTax.com had been flat last year and you're hopeful that you could see some increase there and then drive some conversion, could you help us understand what you're seeing in terms of traffic early in the season at this point? And then I have a follow-up. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, hi, Walter. Absolutely, our focus is actually less about growing more traffic, but actually bringing customers back where they realize that we have an opportunity to help them with confidence with TurboTax Live. So it's really about the mix of folks that we're focused on bringing back and improving the conversion of those that are already there versus looking to improve traffic even more so year-over-year. And we'd like so far what we see. Walter Pritchard : Great. And then just on the small business side, you highlighted ARPU as the focus there and you've had I think some good success with TC. Can you maybe update us on what you're thinking in terms of M&A around the small business groups and bringing in some businesses that might look like issues to help drive the breadth of the product down to the base? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, sure Walter. Yes, first of all everything that we do is driven by what's most important to our customers and anything that allows us to help accelerate payments for our customers, put more money in their pockets through capital, innovate in payrolls not only make it easy but ultimately allow them to hold on to their money the longest in their bank before they have to push a button and the money goes out to their employees or things like time tracking are all important areas that we will continue to innovate because we're still at the early stages. I did not talk about ARPU earlier, in fact what I reiterated is we focus more on online revenue growth and we want you to focus on that being above 30% because that allows our teams to focus on innovation that matters the most. I think as we look ahead, one of the areas that will accelerate our focus will be how do we help product based businesses manage across multiple different channels. And that would be an area where we'll look to accelerate our build internally and look externally if we need to. Walter Pritchard : Great. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Walter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi guys. I'm curious of the TurboTax Live users so far this season, how would you characterize the uptake of those users coming out of first time TurboTax users versus returning TurboTax users? Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Sterling. These are some data points we'll release later but I would tell you that we like the mix that we're seeing just as a reminder, as we've shared at Investor Day we lose 3 million TurboTax customers because ultimately they didn't have confidence and they go elsewhere. We're seeing less dropoff because those that may have a question can now ultimately ask for help and they will get it. And we're seeing an accelerated migration from assistant segment now that they see that there's a way to get expertise on a digital platform. So we like the mix that we are seeing and it's also important to remind ourselves we're early in the journey of TurboTax Live and so we are learning and adjusting literally on a weekly basis.  But we like what we see. Sterling Auty : Great, and then one follow-up, how would you characterize the pricing and promotional activity in the tax side so far through the season? Sasan Goodarzi : Well, as I mentioned earlier, we have a ton of respect for all of those that we compete with and everybody has upped their game as they do every year both in terms of product innovation and their pricing strategy. I would just say that everyone's being aggressive but we've not seen anything that surprised us and we're being extremely choice and deliberate what we do with pricing because we want to truly go after where we can create value for customers and be able to keep those customers in the long-term. Sterling Auty : Great, thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Sterling. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. So Michelle, I'll start with a quick comment, I'm a big fan of the Coffee House. A - Michelle Clatterbuck : Awesome, I'd love to hear that. Brad Reback : Now to the work, Sasan I believe last quarter Brad talked about smarter promotional activity and I took that to mean more in the QBO side. Can you tell us maybe where we are in that process, and is that more of a tailwind going forward or we are beginning to see a big part of that? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Brad was exactly right in what he shared. And we believe we really have a big opportunity as we think about very strategic pricing and it looks and feels different by country depends on which country it is and where we are in the cycle of that country, but let me just use U.S. as an example. You know we are running a number of tests right now because we now have across our product line, we have self-employed all the way to QBO Advanced which is about serving the mid-market and now we're doing tasked with connecting people to experts which is Cookbooks Live, very similar to TurboTax Live. And that really is giving us an opportunity to really think about and test different price points and we believe over time that will be a tailwind for us. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Your line is open. Jim MacDonald : Yes, thanks. I have a couple of quick questions. I'll try another mix TurboTax Live question. Last year you were surprised at the low end had any interest in TurboTax Live. Any thoughts on what you're seeing on the low end of the season? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Hi Jim, you know Greg and the team has some great insight last year which you just articulated and that is every customer no matter what their tax situation is, they will at some point had a question and we're really focused on going after confidence and being able to answer their questions. And so, therefore that's why we made TurboTax Live available across all the SKUs and we are seeing uptake across all the SKUs, which confirmed the learning that we had last year and the hypothesis that we went into this season which is let's make it available for everyone because everybody ultimately has a nagging question and this gives them the chance to complete their taxes with confidence. And we are seeing uptake across every SKU. Jim MacDonald : Okay, great. And Michelle maybe you guys have been really efficient on R&D and G&A this year, any saw that due to the AWS conversion. Any thoughts on we have very low increases this year which is pretty amazing? Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Jim, I appreciate the question. What I would actually take it back to is it's not so much. I mean we're always looking to drive efficiency but we also want to make sure that we are investing at the appropriate levels. And so what I would say specifically around R&D when we look at that spend, it may vary quarter-to-quarter. We really look on an annual basis to stay at about in the range of 19% to 20% of revenue. And so that's really what we focus on, on G&A, we tend to be at the end of last year we had 11% of revenue and we look to see ways to get that to decline over time, but we do look at that also add in on an annual basis. So I would continue to think about it holistically and not get overly caught up in the quarter-to-quarter movement. Jim MacDonald : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open. Michael Millman : Thank you. Question on RAs, to what extent if you promote them this year, was it promoted to all SKUs that you have varying amounts and that it brought in new clients or was it more for existing clients, and to what extent that to increase in coming years? Sasan Goodarzi : Hi Michael, thank you for your questions. I think you're referring to refund anticipation loans. And if that's what you're referring to, first I'll remind us that this was a business that we got out of 10 years ago because just a level of interest rates were not consumer friendly. What we are testing with now is no interest anticipation loans. So that ultimately we can serve consumers in the areas that are most important to them and ultimately do it in a very consumer friendly way which is what the company stands for. So we're getting some of those tests now and getting the results and we'll make decisions and inform what we do next year. Michael Millman : Are you competing for the market which is going up to one case 3500 and another case 7000 last year I think you limited it to 1000? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. We're in a similar ballpark now. We're testing between $250 to $1000. And the main reason is as we've done a lot of testing in the previous years, it is not a reason to switch from one method to another. And so therefore we're very focused on ensuring that we're delivering against what really matters to our customers because it is not, it is not a category grower and it's not a conversion driver which is why we're testing different limits. Michael Millman : Are you promoting it at all? Sasan Goodarzi : No, we're just testing it right now. Michael Millman : Okay. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you very much. First of all, I really appreciate everybody's very thoughtful questions. We're very proud of our results and the momentum that the teams have and we are very inspired by containing the power and prosperity around the world. And we look forward to connecting with you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Jerome, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Intuit's Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Mr. Natoli? The floor is yours. Jerry Natoli : Thank you, Jerome. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's third quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. I am here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2018, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics, and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our Website after this call ends. With that, I will turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Jerry, and thanks everyone for joining us. We had a great third quarter and we\u2019re on track to exceed the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. We\u2019re seeing momentum across every part of the Company and as a result raising our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2019. During the third quarter, total revenue grew 12% overall, fueled by 10% revenue growth in the consumer group and 19% revenue growth in the Small Business and Self-Employ group. With that context, let me start with the consumer group. We had a great tax season. We grew the DIY category and grew our share within the category driven by our innovation and significantly improved customer experiences. We produced our most robust free offering and a significant progress from our effort to transform the assisted category. As we communicated, there are four primary drivers in our consumer business. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. The latest IRS data indicates total returns were up 0.2% through May 10, below historical trends and our own expectation of 1% to 2% growth. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. Category share grew over a point. The fastest pace since 2016 once again outpacing the assisted tax prep category, we are very pleased with this outcome. And as a reminder, DIY category growth is our largest revenue growth driver. The third driver is our share within DIY. We estimate TurboTax Online share grew half a point. The fourth is our average revenue per return which increased again this season. The growth reflect a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live, improved attach and tuned product line adjusted for the new tax legislation. These items were partly offset by deliberate decisions we made to improve the experience for customers with simple returns, including the year-over-year data transfer from no charge and extending free state filing for the entire season. This season we had more customers than ever before paying nothing. We grew this customer growth in the high teens above total unit growth of 5%. We are confident these were the right strategic decisions to drive durable growth especially as we look for way to help customers make end meet going beyond taxes. Our commitment to provide a robust free offering is resulted in more than 55 million TurboTax customers, who paid nothing for their TurboTax experience over the last 5 years. As I shared before, our consumer grew strategy is to expand our lead in the DIY category, transformed the assisted tax preparation category and destruct traditional consumer finance by expanding beyond tax to build the customer platform. This is all-in service with helping our customers need and maximizing their tax refund. We made significant progress against these strategic objectives this season. Within DIY we saw evidence that the bold changes we made to improve the experience for customers who file simple returns, resonated. These changes drove a 6 points improvement in product recommendation scores for the free offering and contributed higher retention. We're transforming the assisted tax customers experience by connecting people to experts on our platform with TurboTax Live. We introduced a range of price points within the product line this season to offer access to an expert for even the simple returns. After just two years, TurboTax Live is now a meaningful contributor to our business and this product line is among the fastest ever to reach this revenue level. The number of customers using TurboTax Live is more than tripled year-over-year. We estimate 70% of customers who are new to Intuit this season and use TurboTax Live came from the assisted method the prior year, higher than TurboTax Online. And for the approximately 2,000 pros on our platform, we improved the on-boarding experience and technology tools, resulting in lower attrition and improve operating efficiencies through the season compared to last year. TurboTax has now approximately 28% share of total individual returns, leading us with a large addressable market. Beyond tax, our consumer platform is aimed at helping customers to unlock smart money decisions by connecting them to the financial products to help them make ends meet. As we learn about their financial life, we can notify them a benefit that can save them money. We now have over 14 million customers registered for Turbo, up from 5 million last season. We have approximately 70 offers this season focusing on four verticals, including credit card, lending, investing and mortgages. We continue to test benefits and monetization models. While we don't expect a significant contribution to revenue in the near-term, we're making progress and continue to be excited about this opportunity. In summary, I'm very proud to what the team delivered across the consumer offering. Now let me turn to Small Business. We delivered another strong quarter in our Small Business and Self-Employed group with online ecosystem revenue growth of 38%, again exceeding our target to grow better than 30%. We continue to place an increased emphasis on online services to deliver more value for our customers by solving their biggest pain points. We're working to achieve our vision of being the center of Small Business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence. Earlier this year, we launched next business day payment, allowing our customers to receive their funds much faster than previously experienced. QuickBooks Capital has funded $360 million cumulative loans since launching around a year-and-a-half ago. Finally, we remain encouraged by our early progress with QuickBooks Advanced Online, designed to disrupt the midmarket by investing in the midmarket Small Business customers with 10 to 100 employees. Within our strategic partner group, our professional tax revenue is on track to grow 4% for fiscal year 2019, that\u2019s the high end of our initial range for this segment. To wrap this session up, we are very pleased with our results. Now, let me shift to a different topic. You may have heard assertion that Intuit engaged and practices design to discourage consumers from following their tax for free. These assertions have come in several forms and I want to address them directly. We stand behind our marketing actions as both being appropriate and consistent with our core value, integrity without compromise. In addition, any suggestion that Intuit does not support the IRS Free File Program is wrong. In fact, we\u2019re proud that for nearly two decades millions of Americans have used TurboTax Free File Program to file their taxes without paying. Our commitment to free based back to 1998 when we launched a program to offer free tax preparation software and e-filing services to lower income and active duty military tax payers. In 2002, the entire tax software industry and the IRS formed the IRS Free File Program model after our initiatives. As a founding member, we\u2019re committed to IRS Free File shared goals of public service and providing free tax filing to those who needed most as we have for nearly 20 years. As I mentioned earlier, we have more than 55 million TurboTax customers who paid nothing for their TurboTax experience over the last five years. Thank you. And now let me hand it over to Michelle to walk you through the financial details. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we delivered revenue of $3.3 billion up 12% year-over-year. GAAP operating income of $1.8 billion versus $1.6 billion a year ago and 11% increase. Non-GAAP operating income of $1.9 billion versus $1.7 billion last year and 11% increase. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.22 versus $4.53 a year ago, up 15% increase and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.55 up from $4.78 last year, a 16% increase. Turning to the business segment, consumer group revenue grew 10% in the fiscal third quarter. TurboTax Online unit grew 7% this season while overall unit increased 5%. We significantly improve the experience within TurboTax Live this season, not only for the customers to use this platform, but also for the tax pros providing tax advice. The improvements we put in place increased pro NBS by more than 50% versus a year ago and created operational efficiency. These include a 30% reduction in pro attrition and improvements in the pro portal that drove a 30% increase in time spent serving customer this season versus last year. We\u2019re excited to continuing scaling this business into the future. We also offer TurboTax Self-Employed customers the opportunity to benefit from tracking their financials throughout the year in QuickBooks Self-Employed. TurboTax Self-Employed product recommendation scores tie TurboTax Live for the highest score among our paid offerings. Turning to the Strategic Partner group, we reported $235 million of professional tax revenue for the third quarter, up 4% year-to-date. In Small Business, total Small Business and Self-Employed revenue grew 19% during the quarter. Online ecosystem revenue remains strong with growth up 38%. We believe the best measure of health and success of our strategy going forward is online ecosystem revenue growth, which we continue to effect to grow better than 30%. Online services year-over-year growth slow this quarter compared to the prior four quarters. This was primarily a function of lacking the TSheets acquisition a year ago. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 32% and in this quarter with over 4.2 million subscribers. Growth remains strong across multiple geographies with U.S. subscribers growing 25% over 3.1 million and international subscribers growing 55% to over 1.1 million. Within QuickBooks Online, Self-Employed subscribers grew to approximately 970,000 from roughly 680,000 one year ago. TurboTax is a significant channel for QuickBooks Self-Employed and 440,000 subscribers have come to this channel up from 330,000 last year. We continue to expect total subscriber growth to moderate as we place a greater focus on additional services and penetrating our broader range of customers. Desktop ecosystem revenue was up 4% in the third quarter. Our Desktop units were up 12% reflecting unusually strong renewables during the quarter. During fiscal 2019, we expect the QuickBook Desktop units and Desktop ecosystem revenues to be roughly flat. Within the Desktop ecosystem, our QuickBooks enterprise customers and revenue continue to grow at a double digit pace in the third quarter. This further reinforces our interest in addressing the needs of mid market Small Business customers with our QBO Advanced offering. Turning our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15%. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finish the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchase a $135 million of stock in the third quarter approximately $2.8 million remained on our organization, and we expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share payable July 18, 2019. This represents a 21% increase versus last year. Turning to guidance, our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 guidance includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP loss per share of $0.35 to $0.33, and non-GAAP loss per share of $0.16 to $0.14. We are also raising our fiscal 2019 guidance following strong performance the first three quarters of the year. Our new guidance includes revenue growth of 12%, up from prior guidance of 8% and 10%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.72 to $5.74, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.67 to $6.69. We now expect the GAAP tax rates of 18.5% for the fiscal 2019. You can find our Q4 and updated fiscal 2019 guidance detail in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan Sasan Goodarzi : Great, thanks Michelle. With that overview of the quarter, I\u2019d like to remind you of the strategic objectives I covered last quarter starting with what matters most to our customers. All of our customers have a common set of needs. They are all trying to make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save money and pay off debt. And those who\u2019ve made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs and go into business for themselves have an additional set of needs. They want to find and keep customers, get paid, excess capital to grow and ensure their books are right. That\u2019s why our vision is to power prosperity around the world and our strategy is the One Intuit Ecosystem, which focuses on unlocking the power of many for the prosperity of one. The evolution of our strategy is to become an AI-driven expert platform. This is about becoming an open-trusted and easy to build on platform where we and our partners solve the most pressing customer problems and deliver awesome experiences. It's about significantly accelerating our application of artificial intelligence, which progressively learns from the large data set across the platform and accelerates speed the benefits to revolutionize the experience for our customers, and it's about solving the largest problem customers face, lack of confidence. By connecting on with experts on our platform, leading the digitization of the services industry, let me provide a few examples. When it comes to connecting people to experts, we\u2019re doing this today with TurboTax Live. Imagine the opportunity we have to expand live expertise across the platform to serve consumers, self-employed and small businesses in the areas of tax, book keeping and financial advices. For Small Business owners, we\u2019re focused on being the center of Small Business growth, using AI across our platforms accelerate cash on funding and payments and to help our customers excess capital. Overtime, we see an opportunity to better serve product based business as they find and sell the customers across channels transforming omni-channel commerce. We also focus on helping customers to make smart decisions with their money by connecting them to financial products that help with more money in their pockets. This is our vision for Turbo where we are increasing active use and engagement leveraging the tax refund moment to connect customers on our platform to meaningful benefits. Last but not least, we\u2019re focused on disrupting the mid market with QBO Advanced. Our AI-driven expert platform will help provide with mid-market customers need at a disruptive price. We are making great progress and we\u2019ll have more to share with you in the coming quarters and at our Investor Day. I want to thank our employees, our customers and our partners for another strong quarter. Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Keith you are now live. Keith Weiss : I want to touch on sort of the tax business this quarter and two kind of related next questions. One, you've talked about some reactions I guess took during the quarter. The sort of free state for the entire period as well as free data transfer that push more people into the free category. Can you talk to what is the rationale behind it? What is like the business reason for making those moves? Number one. And number two, we have kind of the read press reports, we've also seen some political sort of rhetoric starting to rise, a letter some senator sent to you today. Is there any reaction needed from that type of kind of political pressure? Is there any behavioral changes or anything you plan on doing differently in the TurboTax business in response to senator's pressure or is there pressure you're getting from some state local governments as well? Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Hi, Keith, thank you for your question. Let me start with what's matters most to our customers and as you've heard us talk about, there are two things that matter most to our customers. One is helping them to meet ends meet and the other is helping them to get the largest tax refund. In that context, our three areas that we're focused on, one is, expanding our lead and the do-it-yourself category. It's about transforming the assisted category and it's actually disrupting consumer finance and going beyond tax. In that context, our focus in, in essence expanding our lead and the do-it-yourself category has been to ensure that we have the best product experience. And so what we did this year was very much in line with our strategic approach vary durable, which is to deliver the best free offering this year through the year-over-year data transfer for free and all to actually extending free for the whole year and including our state. And we did that because it gives us the opportunity to really help those that are underserved and those that struggle with the income that they make. While at the same time, helping to transform the assisted category, this give us the opportunity as we grow our customers to ultimately find ways to help them, makes ends meet through the offerings that we have in Turbo. So, those were the drivers behind the decision and we're actually quite excited about seeing the results that we got, which is both customer growth and revenue growth. PRS is actually up over 8 points. Retention is up based on the decisions that we made. So, all-in-all we feel very good about the decision and again it's in context of our durable game plan. I think the second thing that I would say is that, we have been supporters of free and in fact, as I shared earlier, this dates back to 20 years ago. And with respect to would there be any behavioral changes from us, our view is that, our focus has been to actually grow the do-it-yourself category and expand our lead in the category, one element of it being through free.  So, we don't actually see our behavioral is changing. We believe that we are focused on the right thing, which is delivering for our customers. And we'll continue to work on with industry and the IRS to see if there are ways that we can continue to improve Free File Program. But at the end of the day, our focus is on our customers and we believe that everything that we have been doing is very durable and very much in line with what's most important to our customers. And I actually have a lot of confidence in the actions that we're taking. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Brad, your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much and I echo the congrats on a great tax season. Sasan, with TurboTax Live units more than tripling, it seems like there was a lot of success there and I know you shared some data points. But can you maybe just expand a bit more on the mix within TurboTax Live in terms of net new versus customers coming over from the existing base? And as well, if you can comment on the changes in the tax code and expectations around trade up, trade down and new filers coming in the franchise, how does that play out versus expectations? Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Brad, and thank you for your questions. I think I\u2019ll just go back to where I started just a moment ago, which is every twist that we are making is very deliberate and based on what we saw the season, it was really within our expectations. And our singular focus is to serve our customers and we want to do that through expanding our lead and do-it-yourself category, and we want to also do that from transforming the assisted category and helping all of those customers with benefits that goes beyond taxes. With that as context, we\u2019re very pleased with TurboTax Live performance this year. Given that we in essence gave our customers the ability to pick TurboTax Live through any of the skews. Our customers grow tripled, 70% of those customers that came in, the new ones were actually from the assisted category. The prior year for our pros, the net promoter was up 50%. They spend 30% more of their time serving customers this year compared to last year. So, we\u2019re very pleased with our progress this year and we know exactly the areas to improve actually accelerate our growth in this area next year. As it relates to the tax code, as you well know we are big supporters of tax simplification. We believe that it enable consumers to take more control over their financial life. It actually is a catalyst for do-it-yourself category and we needed to change our line-up this year to ensure that we delivered for customers given the tax still changes. And in essence what we saw was all really within our expectations and we\u2019re very pleased with the performance for our customers are PRS scores and the teams have done a wonderful job. Brad Zelnick : Thanks, Sasan. And if I could just squeeze one in there for Mitchell, with consumer margin ticking down from prior Q3. And I know you\u2019ve been fairly disciplined and consistent with how you think about acquisition costs and metrics like LTC act. But can you just remind us especially with TurboTax Live coming into the mix, how you\u2019re thinking about acquisition cost? And how we should think about the cost of delivering TTL this season? And how we should really think consumer margins going forward? Sasan Goodarzi : So, Brad, I do this to Mitchell all the time in our meeting. So, let me start and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Mitchell. It's a great question and I know others have it on their mind. I wanted to go back to the evolution of our strategy, which is about being an AI-driven experts platform and this is about significantly accelerating our progress with a platform and an ecosystem. And when you think about our platform and ecosystem, we are actually building more and more of our services to be able to serve all of our segments. The examples would be the services that we fill across our ecosystem for TurboTax Live, four QuickBook Live, for CyberSecurity. The data scientist that we hired that ultimately fuels our machine learning engine that drives our AI benefits for our customers. Those are all at the Company level, which is why we always talk about we manage the margins at the Company level. And therefore that\u2019s really what\u2019s important for you all to pay attention to, specifically in the consumer group our year-to-date margins are actually pretty much flat with last year, so we\u2019re actually quite pleased with the progress. I don\u2019t know if I left anything for the answer, but\u2026 Michelle Clatterbuck : The only thing I would ask to that Brad is that. When we look at the consumer margins specifically there have been a number of questions just around TurboTax Live and how we think about that. We were able to grow the customers to react this year and yet we had pretty much the same number of pros, the 2000 pros that we had last year. So that's just demonstrate some of the efficiencies that I spoke about earlier, and the operational efficiencies and being able to increase customer serving time with our pros by 30%. So, we actually liked the incremental margin that we're seeing for the offering, and we are we looking -- when we look forward, we're focused on opportunities here like automation and augmented intelligence. All of these things do look for ways to continue to make the agents as efficient as possible and also to continue to streamline the on-boarding process. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Kirk, your line is now open. Kirk Materne : I wanted to just double click a little bit on your commentary around the platform, your expert platform powered by AI. Even clearly, we've seen some of the benefits of that with TurboTax Live. There's been some discussion on the website about QuickBooks Live and you guys testing that out. And I was just kind of wondering, how we should think about the evolution on sort of the Small Business side around that narrative? And I know you've actually given too many data points now [indiscernible] but what should we be expecting to perhaps at the Analyst day? Or give just some ideas about how we can kind of hold you guys? Or what we should expect for you all around this development of this narrative? Sasan Goodarzi : Great question. Thank you, Kirk. Couple of things I would say. One is we think about this opportunity, starting with what's most important to our customers. And the biggest challenge that our customers says, consumers, self-employed and small businesses is confidence. In fact, you've heard us talk over the years around the opportunity around non-consumption. One of the drivers as to why people don't switch is because they're looking to interact with a human being to help them, do their taxes, their bookkeeping and advice. On the other side, we've got enrolled agents, pros and accountants that only serve customers within maybe a 10 to 15 mile radius max. And they don't like marketing and they don't like pursuing customers. And we believe that this inform a huge strategic opportunity, we have to connect people to experts, to really go after non-consumption, to help our customers make ends meet, to help them run their business and be successful. So I wanted to start there because not only are we in the very early innings of TurboTax Live and what the opportunity that we have to transform the assisted category. That same opportunity exists when it comes to helping small businesses, get started and run their business. And we've been one, leveraging the same common services that we've built over the years for TurboTax Live to significantly accelerate, building out QuickBooks Live. And we've been testing our QuickBooks Live over the last many months. And what we learned is very consistent with what we learned from consumers that are trying to do their taxes. They're looking for ways to get started and get set up. So, I am actually looking for advice of I have payroll due on Friday. I am not going to be able to make my payroll. What advice you have for me? Some actually want the bookkeeper to actually take all their information, all their documents and set QuickBooks up for them and then give them advice. So, we're learning a variety of things and we believe that the opportunity of significance for our customers and the ARPU is actually quite significant because the benefit is there. I would say on the other side, as we've been talking to enrolled agents accountants and pros. Once they understand what we\u2019re trying to do, they are very excited about this opportunity because they see it as an opportunity to be able to grow their business but do improve focusing on what matters most to them versus marketing. And so the way we want all of you to think about this, this is a big opportunity for us to connect peoples to experts on our platform to go after consumers, self-employed, small businesses and fundamentally digitize the services industry and build advantage across the Company. Kirk Materne : That\u2019s really helpful. If I could just sneak in one for Michelle sort of related on that topic. As we think about sort of the need for your guys to build out more AI sources from low to this platform. I assume there\u2019s advantages for you also work with AWS on that where you can take those leverage them as well as add people on your side, so that the narrative ongoing operating income passing revenue whole even as given this platform narrative unfolds over the next couple of years? Thanks. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks Kurt, thanks for the question. Yes I mean when we talk about fitting on principals start there and those really are extremely doable and we are committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and operating income dollars faster than revenue as you mentioned. When you think specifically about something like the experts platform AI services on that yes we have employed and continue to employ as we talk about at Investor Day a number of data appliances who are coming in to really help us continue to develop this critical capability. AWS is absolutely a keen partner with us. We\u2019ve moved all our customer facing apps to it already, we\u2019re continuing to move some of the back end stuff and we expect that to take and make another 18 to 24 months but they are absolutely a critical partner for us and we don\u2019t see that having an impact when we look at growing operating income. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Scott you are now live. Scott Schneeberger, your line is now live. Scott Schneeberger : I wanted to ask in the consumer segment, your margin, someone asked earlier it was a little larger than expected in third, but Michelle you've pointed out that year-to-date it was about on track with last year. So my question is, somewhat to the extent you could speak to this year you've marketed TurboTax Live in the early season, but you haven\u2019t in early season last year. You also had the four tiers of pricing in TurboTax Live this year. So is there anything a unique or interesting about that that have an impact? And if you can elaborate a little bit on, what you saw introducing the four tiers year-over-year versus last year? Thanks a lot. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thank you, Scott. Thanks for the question. Actually, where I am going to start is, is if I set back and look at TurboTax Live. Sasan did mention earlier that this year we made the very deliberate decision to offer it across our lineup. It's been enabled so from simple return although it's very complex return to be able to have access to expert to really get the confidence say need, to go through their tax filings situation. So with that, we believe that, that's absolutely the right thing for us to do and a right strategic decision. We did see a lower ARPC in that, but we believe that long-term with the opportunity that we have in TurboTax Live that's a right thing to do for our customers. If I think back to just margins overall and we did talk about the consumer margins earlier. And when I think about just the CG margins in total there, we have marketed TurboTax Live this year at the very beginning of the season and we didn't do that last year. But we are continually making decisions around marketing decisions and where we apply marketing dollar and how we do that's around the tax season. So there really wasn't anything dramatically different this year that would have impacted our margin. But once again, I would tell you, I wouldn't focused really on consumer growth margin, we really do manage the margins at a full company level on an annual basis in fact I really wouldn't really get to enough on what happen us to getting this season and end the season between months a quarters. I really was looking more from a company standpoint on an annual basis. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks, understood. And then certainly Small Business margins were impressive on year-over-year basis. My follow-up is on the fourth quarter guide, it's down $0.16 to $0.14 year-over-year, that's the lowest guide in the fourth quarter over the last time we saw performance of that low was fiscal '10. I'm just curious is there, what are the drivers, is it timing or is it something that been impacting that. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks for your question. We actually feel great about the momentum of the Company and momentum of online revenue growth especially in Small Business, because that's the majority of our revenue in the fourth quarter. So, in fact, as I look back to the years that you are comparing, we have more momentum now than we did then. So I feel great about the momentum of the business, the innovation is coming out of the Company and what we guided. The last thing I would say, this could be comparing ASC 606 to 605 accounting and we believe that's probably lie your comparing numbers that may be look odd but in terms of what we're guiding to and momentum never been stronger. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Jennifer, your line is open. Jennifer Lowe : Great, may be just a couple of quick ones from me. First, looking at the growth in online services, I know, you mentioned that they're anniversarying the TSheets acquisition, but even with that that was a pretty impressive growth number. And it certainly looks like you're going to exit that inorganic benefit to about higher growth rate than you were before that. Can you just talk a little bit about what are the levers that are really working within that segment? Is it payroll? Is it payment? Is that everything? Just any color there would be very helpful? Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Jennifer. Thank you for your question. We're also very pleased with our online services growth. In fact, as you look back to where we are today versus about 18 months ago, the first quarter of fiscal year '18 we more than doubled the growth rate. And really it's very focused on what's most important to our customers which is helping them grow, helping them to get paid, helping them to get access to capital, helping them pay their employees. We really thing about our customer problems and how we saw them in context of whether it's a accounting services, whether it's payment services, whether it's payroll services, capital, time tracking and now experts services that we\u2019re going to be launching with QuickBooks Live. And so the direct answer to your question is, it's really all the services that we\u2019ve been investing in and focusing on, because they matter a lot to our customers that\u2019s contributing to the online services growth that you\u2019re seeing, it's any one thing it's all of them. Jennifer Lowe : And then just a quick one, I know last year there was a lot of discussion around the first year learning on the renewal rate of the self-employed users that came in through TurboTax attached. Now that we've got another year of history on that obviously the aggregated numbers looks very good, but I\u2019m curious as you start to explore that, that cohort just any additional insights on how their retention trended this year? And how you think about that going forward? That\u2019s it for me. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, very good question. Let me make few different statements. One is, the reason we\u2019re excited about this whole notion of being an AI driver expert platform in context of the customer problems that I articulated. It's also holding the interaction between customers on our platform. 40% of those that are small businesses hire are actually self-employed. And so what we\u2019re solving for is to ensure that we can get as many customers on our platform as possible, because we find, we've solved the particular pain point for them. And then solving the interaction between those customers on our platforms seamlessly, so it becomes the place where they run their time, they run their business, they run their life. And so strategically I want to make sure you need why the self-employed segment is so important and it's not we don\u2019t just view it as a segment on its own. With that said in terms of the regal rates, now that we\u2019re a couple of years in it's in line with what we\u2019ve assume then of course at Investor Day we\u2019ll share more of it, but it's very much in line with what we had assumed. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Beck from KeyBanc. Josh, your line is open. Josh Beck : Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, it's a really good success with TurboTax Live more than tripling. I\u2019m wondering, if you look underneath the growth a little bit. Could you talk about the retention in those live filers from the prior season and let say renewed that product skew? Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Josh thank you for your question. What I would share is one, as you said we look at this is a $20 billion TAM opportunity where there is a huge confidence problem to solve, which is why we extended across all of our skews. And we see this is an opportunity to get quick income for our pros and help them with their life. And with that said, we love what we saw this year as you said three aspect roles on customers 70% of the new customers came from the assisted method the prior year. And our NPS and net promoters that are up into right, we of course at this point are not sharing the exact numbers. That maybe something that we share at Investor Day, but I think the takeaway you should have is on every dimension customers growth, retention, NPS for both the customers that we serve and the experts that are on the platform serving our customers, very proud of the improvements our team has made. Josh Beck : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then I also wanted to ask about the success that you have on the free side when you look maybe more midterm or long-term. Does that in some ways increase the opportunity for monetizing Turbo? Or is that maybe not the one of the opportunities you see down the road? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, the way to think about it is really around what's most important to our customers, which is really about helping our customers make ends meet, and helping them get the largest tax refund and just finding ways to help them reduce their debt and increase their savings. And so when we think about three, one is focused on a segment of the marketplace, where we believe they deserve to do their taxes for free, and therefore why we significantly improve the experience this year, to ensure that we deliver against the standards we expect of ourselves and they expect of us. It then gives us the opportunity through Turbo with the customers consent to help connect them to benefits that matter most because we are an agnostic platform. Well, we care most about is ensuring that they have an opportunity to get savings accounts at the highest rate that if they're going to get a personal loan, get that the best rate possible versus pushing our products. And that for us gets our heartbeats going faster because it's squarely focused on the customer and what matters most The opportunity is actually significant, just in the United States, consumers overpaid in fees well over 60 billion plus. And we have an opportunity to match them with products, financial products that are right for them at the lowest rates. And so we use that as an opportunity to deliver for our customers and eventually a business opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line is Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Sterling, your line is now open. Jackson Ader : Great. Thanks. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. Thanks for taking our questions. The first one, Sasan, if you can just help us reconcile something, the 55 million users over the last five years that you spent have paid nothing. How can we square that with the roughly 1.1, 1.2 million pre filing alliance users that you report on the fact sheet? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Jackson, thanks for your question. As I mentioned earlier, we did for the last 20 years supported customers that have certain income level and to be able to file for free. We do that directly with customers. And we also do that from the IRS Free File Program and that's something that the IRS has done a wonderful job setting up with the entire industry. And so, the 55 million includes both the free offerings directly to customers and the free file offerings that's all in one when you look at the 55 million over the last five years. Jackson Ader : Understood. Okay, thank you. Then follow-up question, how many filers in the U.S. do you believe qualify for free filing on an annual basis? Sasan Goodarzi : You know, our SMS is probably about over 100 million-ish or so. This is the figure that we've talked about for years that ultimately are eligible for free and our other estimate is probably 20 to 25 million of them actually use free because customers have choice and they decide if they want added benefits that goes beyond free. But those are you know the SMS that we have. Operator : Your next question comes from the line is Ken Wang from Guggenheim Securities. Ken you are now live. Ken Wong : Thanks for taking my question guys. Michelle, you guys mentioned that you had 30% increase in your TurboTax Live agent engagement, but also saw kind of essentially no increase in the number of agents actually process those plans. How should we think about the capacity going forward? Is that something that you think you can still extract some incremental efficiencies or looking next year that\u2019s an area where you guys have probably step up a little more? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Ken, thanks for question. As we think about TurboTax Live we continue to be very excited about the opportunity there. When we look at just $20 billion opportunity is just in market and really helping customers have the confidence to file your tax returns and we do think this is a great opportunity. As we mentioned we did the improvement this year with three \u2013 customers and yes we had the same number of pro-2000 and so obviously we did have a couple of the operational efficiencies that we deliver this year. Going forward we continue to look for ways to improve that experience. we want to make sure that we have helping firms get setup as easy as possible, so making that clear as possible and continuing those there are tools that use having those more efficient really looking for ways to automate work before the pros and use augmented intelligence and the best way possible to help them with their interactions with the consumers. Ken Wong : Got it and then Sasan one of the goals or I guess a couple of goals at the beginning of the year were to improve conversion at the top of funnel and then obviously increased retention as well. Sounds like retention improved expectations, any comments on how you guys did in terms of conversion at the top of funnel? Sasan Goodarzi : We\u2019ll look at sharing some of this at Investor Day, but I would tell you overall we\u2019re pleased on every mark that matters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, your line is now open. Brent Thill : Just on QuickBooks, I think Michelle you said that strategic direction of how you're looking at the metrics is changing. I mean, many of those the growth rate is materially decelerating, but we\u2019ve also had some price increases from fall to now I think you\u2019ve raised prices on the essential plus list prices. Can you just talk through this dynamic of the decel, but also looking at price ranges and how are you thinking about that as a whole? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Brent. Yes, thank you for the question on QBO. QBOs, this quarter were at 32% which is slightly down, but we still feel that that is a very strong number. We have continued to say that we expect the QBO subs growth to moderate. And when you really look at what is joining the health of Small Business, it is truly on my ecosystem revenue and that is continuing to be a strong, a strong growth rate of 38% this quarter. Just to pick up on your price comments, we always look at our price increases, we always have price increases that on any specific basis. We really look to continue to deliver the value for customers and we measure those very carefully. We never want to take a price increase that is going to dramatically impact our customer. And so, we look at those as we deliver more benefits to customer and we continue to watch on the retention side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Raimo, your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. Sasan, can I ask about Turbo please. You've mentioned the 14 million users there and the 70 offering. Can you talk and what they do? Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? Obviously, there are other guys that kind of have that same business model. And is it more like -- is it more on the mortgage side, more on the credit cards side like what are you seeing in terms of early trends there? Sasan Goodarzi : Raimo, thanks for your question. So, our singular focus is to help our customers make ends meet when it comes to our vision with that Turbo. And with the customer's consent, what we trying to do, is to learn what's most important to them and based on understanding their behaviors, we will connect them to financial products that are right for them. And remember, we're in a very early innings of really understanding and learning what most important to them. What's a very differentiated for us is, the customer is engaging with us at a very important moment which is the tax refund moment. And it's an opportunity for us to learn from them, what you want to do with your money. Do you want to actually save more money or will make offers such as pay you look like you have for credit cards, would you like a consolidated to one personal loan that could save you x amount of dollars and here is by the way what you kind of afford. So, we're really focused on helping them make ends meet, reduce their debt, and ultimately save more money. And our advantage is the fact that we know the customer, we understand their behavior than we're on an agnostic platform to connect them to those products that matter most. And so, we're very early, but we love what we're seeing and what we're learning and just informing our game plan as we look ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect, and if I might squeeze in one follow-up. This tax season, I mean, with this could remind us, is this -- was this first one you've on fully AWS and what was the pros and cons from that one? Or just did you have some duplication? So, thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. It's out second year on AWS and we had a, what I would call and our teams would call an epic finish with a number of current users at the end of the season, the performance, the availability was the best we have ever seen. And one element of that is our team did incredible job, making sure the experience was an awesome experience, but too we credits being on AWS that's the fact that we handle those kinds of volumes. But it was our second year and it was a great outcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs. Chris, you are now live. Chris Merwin : Okay. Thanks a lot. Just a couple from this if I could. I guess the first was on the TurboTax Live marketing campaign. I was wondering if you could just comment on how that performed relative to your expectation? I know the growth you saw year-on-year was very strong, so just any detail you could you could share? And I guess also how you're thinking about continuing to invest and marketing behind TurboTax Live to continue to disrupt that assisted tax category? And then I had a quick follow-up. Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Chris, thanks for the question. In terms of raising awareness, we take a very strategic approach to our campaigns and really the focus right now has been to raise awareness, to help consumers understand that there is a different way that there could be another way given their tax situation. And given the campaign this year, it actually worked very well, we look at mix modelling, a marketing modelling and trying to understand how what the returns were for the dollars that we spend and the effectiveness of the campaign. And we would really like the metrics that we have seen and we\u2019ll be doing more deep dives to understand what that will inform for the next year. But the way you should be thinking about is just as that the beginning of a multiyear and decade campaign to rate awareness delivering often experiences a more customers held one another and then shifting the elements of the campaign from a just simple awareness to effectiveness. But thus far we\u2019ve enjoyed what we\u2019ve seen. Raimo Lenschow : Okay, great. And then follow-up was just on the revenue per return, I think it was up low double-digits in the 2Q, but up more likely low singles in the 3Q. I know you talk about the decision obviously to optimise the user experience which is resulted in more free filers in Q3. But what do you -- for those changes live in Q2 as well and I'm just curious why there is I guess such a big delta between the growth and revenue per return between 2Q and 3Q? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, sure. Is your question around TurboTax Live versus TurboTax? Raimo Lenschow : Or just the overall kind of changes you made to promote more free filing across the total platform. Sasan Goodarzi : Got it, got it. Thank you for the question. So, two things that I would say, one is based on the decisions that we\u2019ve made to accelerate free and the decisions that we\u2019ve made to have TurboTax Live across the line up. In essence, our ARPC would have been several points higher, if we chose not to make that decision. But we don\u2019t solve for ARPC, what we\u2019re solving for is accelerated customer growth and making sure that we grow the revenue double-digit and ensuring that operating income grows faster than revenue. So, I would just focus on those principles, but I would just end with again saying ARPC would have been several points higher, if we have not made those decisions on free. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Kartik, your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hi, good evening, Sasan. Just a couple of questions on TurboTax Live, as you watch the progression of that product and it has a price point. What are your thoughts on price elasticity for the product? You think there is an opportunity that it's providing value that you can raise prices for? Do you think this is a product where you might have to lower the prices and you\u2019ll get a lot more quantity of users? Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Kartik, thanks for your question. This is a $20 billion TAM 90 million customers, our number one focus is acing the experience for our customers help them to build confidence, acing the experience for our pros as they do a spectacular job delivering for our customers. And there is so much more room for growth here. The least of our focus is pricing although we think about that. It's about solving the problem well because we believe that there is so much headroom for growth. We do believe there is certainly headroom for price increases, but we\u2019re just so early and it's such a huge TAM that we just believe the opportunity is to nail the experience and get as many customers to use the platform as possible. So it goes viral and they tell others. Kartik Mehta : And Mitchell just one more question on margins as it related to TurboTax Live. I know you\u2019ve talked a lot about automating the process, AI. I\u2019m wondering, how close you think TurboTax Live margins can get to traditional TurboTax since there is human intervention obviously in the TurboTax Live? I\u2019m just wondering how close you can get by using AI and automation? Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Kartik. I appreciate the question on TurboTax Live. One of the things that has really helped us when we think about TurboTax Live; number one, I mean, last year was the first year this year, as we said, a number of times means driven and a ton of efficiencies with three extra customers, and yet the same number of pros. But we really continue to look at how do we use automation? And how do we use augmented intelligence to drive it. Another thing I would say is, we have focused a lot on using technology here and really focusing on technology first, then bringing the experts to help, which has enabled us to be in potentially a different margin range than most people may with this type of an offering. So we're very pleased with the margins we're seeing. And as Sasan just mentioned, if there's so much opportunity here right now, we are really focused on how do we continue to bring customers in and continue to just deliver that great experience. Operator : Your next question comes from the line is Michael Turrin from Deutsche Bank. Michael, your line is now open? Michael Turrin : Just one for me. Following up on the QBO subs question earlier, appreciate you been signaling that growth rate is expected to moderate, but looks like it's happening a bit more on the U.S. side. Is there anything you can add in terms of expectations products split between U.S. and international could stack up in terms of a more normalized growth profile going forward? And then on the international side, any specific geos to call out there in terms of contribution? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Michael, thanks for the question. First of all the reasons we talked about watching online ecosystem revenue growth of 30% plus is, it gets to a place where how do you count to stub because we have SE subs, we have QBO subs. We're now looking at TSheets subs, we have payment subs. So there is one element of that is, how do you count the subs? And so, we want to make sure that we actually provide you all a very clear flagpole of what to watch for. The second is we're actually very pleased with our progress in the U.S. because while we've been focused on self-employed which has seen very good growth, we're really focused on accelerating our focus into mid market. And so when you look at the growth rate in the U.S. are 25%, given the mix of customers that were actually focused on going after, and specifically the services that were focused on going after, we're very pleased with that. And I think, ultimately, the bang marks to your question is, I would focus on online ecosystem revenue growth because that is the best indication for the health of the franchise. And the second part of your question, I apologize, I did not answer yet which is the geographies. We are very pleased with our progress in UK, Canada and Australia. And we are making very good progress in getting the product market fit in France and in Brazil. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Water, you are now live. Water Pritchard : Hi, thanks. Just the most questions have been answered here, but two quick ones. One on I think there's a fear at the beginning of a season possibly the season trade down from customers who had simplified filings and go into these standardized deduction moving to free. You did have a strong performance on free. Could you help us understand in the context of what you ended up seeing in tax season? How the trade down effect either impact -- didn\u2019t impact the number? Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Walter. The trade down effect did not affect our expectation. It was within our expectation. It was the deliberate decision that we made was with again in context of our durable strategy of delivering the best free offering ever, which was around including year-over-year data transfer for free and extending free for the entire season that really impacted our ARPC. And again was all very deliberate, we\u2019re pleased with what we saw. But really trade down was not a driver well that\u2019s for expectation. It was within our expectations. Walter Pritchard : And then on advance, I'm curious how much -- I know it's really, what percentage of those customers are you seeing to sort of a direct conversion off of QuickBooks to QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Desktop? And how much of it sorted out plan displacement with other kind of midmarket financial accounting packages and other sources? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, thank you for the question. First of all I\u2019ll start with around 70-30, 70% existing 30% new, only because we really haven\u2019t yet aggressively pursued new because we\u2019ve actually been focused on building out the platform. The reason the mix is so much existing is. We have about 180,000 or so QBO customers that are actually kind of in that mid market range. They\u2019re looking to be able to do a batch invoicing. They\u2019re looking to be able to have roles and permissions. And we\u2019ve been aggressively building out -- building out the platform so we can ultimately migrate those customers to platform that they are happier with. And then we will shift more aggressively to go after new customers. Desktop is not really playing a role just yet because those desktop customers are really looking for inventory capability, which we will build out as we overtime begin to more aggressively focus on product based businesses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yao Chu from RBC. Yao, your line is now open. Yao Chu : Hi everyone thanks for taking my question and squeezing me at the end here. Two quick ones, we've picked up a late-season to TurboTax Live pro SKU. Just any comment on that what\u2019s the meaningful impact, and how to think about that attentions of character build out? And the other one I guess is a lot of discussion around TurboTax Live, but we view this very much as a multi-year phenomenon. Is there a way to think about an upper bound of the attached on a three year basis, a five year basis of a nature investment needed to get there in broad terms should be helpful? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, thank you for your question. I\u2019ll start with your first one, which is we\u2019re always experimenting, as I mentioned earlier, with the $20 billion market opportunity and 90 million customers most of which use the associated category because of a lack of confidence, really our initial focus was helping those that may just want to use TurboTax but are looking for help on on-demand. We\u2019re also testing an essence full service, which is we\u2019ll do it for you that\u2019s what they want us to do. And that\u2019s the test it sounds like you fell into, and we're early in our inside the learnings to see what the future brings based on what\u2019s most important to our customers. In terms of TurboTax Live, we don\u2019t think about it in terms of the attach, we think about it in terms of what\u2019s most important to our customers because there are some customers that come in and write off the bat. They want to ensure that they have helped along the way. Overtime, it could be those that also come in and are looking for this full service offering. So we don\u2019t think about it in context of attach. We think about it in context of the segments of customers that are up higher doubts, fear and uncertainty and are looking for an essence expertise and help. In terms of how to think about how to model it, you know, Mitchell, I think did a nice job earlier around the way you all and the way we would want you all to be thinking about this opportunity for us. We are putting our best and brightest engineers on solving this problem to an AI-driven expert platform. It's all about applying technology to solve this problem very, very well, not only for the customer, but for the experts. So, we should not think about this opportunity as a typical human capital business. We should think about this as completely digitizing services and experts having AI-driven power tools at your fingertips to be able to serve customers very, very easily. And in fact the more we learn by solving the two sided problems. We actually make the platform better, so that the customers get the answers to their questions and much, much more rapidly. So I think the way to think about this is just a huge opportunity for us to drive revenue growth and think about our margins and way to model it at the Company level, which is the guidance that we provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, I am not showing any further questions. Would you like close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you and I apologize for interrupting you. First, I want to thank everyone for the great discussion and the great questions. I just want to leave you with the notion of we are very excited about of strategy of an AI-driven expert platform. We have incredible confidence in our segments, incredible confidence in the progress of the Company. We look forward to sharing more in the upcoming quarters and at Investor Day, and we hope everybody has a wonderful rest of the day and we thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Intuit's Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Mr. Natoli? Jerry Natoli : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. I\u2019m here with Intuit's CEO Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2018 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. Before I turn it over to Sasan, I wanted to share that I\u2019m retiring at the end of January, so this will be my last Intuit earnings call. It\u2019s been a privilege working with the leadership teams at Intuit and a pleasure engaging with all of our shareholders over the years. I'm leaving you in good hands, as Kim Watkins has been promoted to Vice President of Investor Relations. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Jerry for your friendship and the incredible impact you've had over the years. We are going to miss you my friend. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong fourth quarter capping off an excellent finish to fiscal year 2019. Fourth quarter revenue grew 15%, and full-year revenue grew 13%, exceeding the original guidance of 8% to 10% growth that we provided at the beginning of the year. We are seeing our AI-driven expert platform strategy play out in our results, and we believe this positions us well for durable growth in the future. We saw continued momentum across the company in 2019. Total revenue growth was fueled by 15% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, and 11% growth in the Consumer Group.  QuickBooks Online and TurboTax Online platform revenue grew over 21%, totaling approximately $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2019. We are guiding to another year of strong revenue growth for the company in fiscal year 2020. Now, let\u2019s dig into our results starting with Small Business. We delivered another strong quarter in our Small Business and Self-Employed Group with Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 35% in the fourth quarter and 38% in fiscal year 2019. Online Ecosystem revenue is at a $1.8 billion annualized run-rate, and we continue to expect it to grow more than 30%. We continue to prioritize online services to deliver more value for our customers by addressing their biggest pain points. We\u2019re working to achieve our vision of being the center of small business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital, and pay employees with confidence. Earlier this year, we launched next business-day payments, a service that enables our customers to receive their funds the next business-day instead of having to wait two to five days to get their money. This change is resonating with our customers. Our online payments business remained strong with charge volume up 40% in the fiscal year 2019 for customers using QuickBooks Online. Within payroll, we introduced next-day and same-day direct deposit to enable customers to hold on to their money longer and better manage their cash flow. QuickBooks Online payroll revenue overall grew more than 35% in fiscal year 2019. At the same time, we\u2019re seeing greater adoption of our full-service payroll offering, which is growing more than 35 points faster than our self-service offering and has a higher lifetime value. Full-service payroll provides even more support for our customers as we help them pay their employees accurately and stay compliant. On the time-tracking front, we improved the mobile capability of our TSheets offering and added new features such as GPS time-tracking, which increases accuracy and flexibility for both employees and employers. More than 1 million employees are tracking their time on this platform each month, up nearly 60% from last year. We are optimistic about QuickBooks Online Advanced, our online offering designed to disrupt the mid-market by addressing the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. While it is still early days, we like what we see. We are learning a lot about these customer needs and remain encouraged that this offering presents a significant opportunity for us longer term. Now turning to tax. As we shared last quarter, we had a great tax season and grew revenue for the Consumer Group 11% in fiscal year 2019. Our Consumer Group strategy is to expand our lead in the do-it-yourself category, transform the assisted tax preparation category, and disrupt traditional consumer finance by expanding beyond tax to build a consumer platform. This is all in service to helping our customers make ends meet and maximize their tax refund. Driven by our innovation and significantly improved customer experiences, we grew both the DIY category and our share within it. Across all tax prep methods, TurboTax now has approximately 28% share of total individual returns leaving us with a large opportunity. This season, we further personalized the tax preparation process using artificial intelligence. We went to market with our most robust free offering. We expect the strategic decisions we made this season, including our investment in artificial intelligence and in our free experience, to drive durable growth across the Consumer business, especially as we look for ways to help customers make ends meet going beyond taxes. We also made significant progress in our effort to transform the assisted category by tripling the number of customers using TurboTax Live, which connects people to experts on our platform. TurboTax Live is now a meaningful contributor to our business, and compared to other Intuit product lines is among the fastest ever to reach this revenue level. We feel great about the experience we delivered for our customers to drive increased confidence while improving operating efficiency for our pros on our platform. Beyond tax, our consumer platform is aimed at helping customers unlock smart money decisions by connecting them to financial products that helps them make ends meet. We have over 14 million customers registered for Turbo, up from 5 million last season. While we don\u2019t expect a significant contribution to revenue in the near term, we\u2019re identifying ways to deliver more value to our customers. As we look to next season, our team is actively developing the next wave of innovation to better serve consumers. We're confident in our Consumer Group strategy and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for this business. To wrap up, we are very pleased with our results in fiscal 2019, and we\u2019re energized for another great year in fiscal year 2020. Thank you, and let me now hand it over to Michelle to walk you through the financial details. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we delivered revenue of $994 million, up 15% year-over-year. GAAP operating loss of $153 million versus a loss of $200 million a year ago, non-GAAP operating loss of $47 million versus a loss of $15 million last year, GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.17 versus a loss per share of $0.15 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.09 versus a loss per share of $0.01 last year. Turning to the business segments. In Small Business and Self-Employed, revenue grew 16% during the quarter and 15% in fiscal 2019. Online Ecosystem revenue remained strong with growth of 35% in the fourth quarter and 38% for the year. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy going forward is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we continue to expect to grow better than 30%. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 33%, ending the quarter with over 4.5 million subscribers. Growth remains strong across multiple geographies, with U.S. subscribers growing 25% to over 3.2 million and international subscribers growing 58% to 1.3 million. Within QuickBooks Online, Self-Employed subscribers grew to over 1 million, up from roughly 720,000 one year ago. We continue to expect total subscriber growth to moderate as we place a greater focus on additional services. Desktop Ecosystem revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter and roughly flat for the year, in line with our expectations. Within the Desktop Ecosystem, our QuickBooks Enterprise revenue continued to grow at a double-digit pace in the fourth quarter. This further reinforces our interest in addressing the needs of mid-market small business customers with our QBO Advanced offering. Consumer Group revenue grew 11% in fiscal 2019, above the high end of our original guidance. Fiscal 2019 is the second consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth for the Consumer Group. TurboTax Online units grew 7% this season, while overall units increased 5%. As we shared last quarter, the DIY category share grew over a point, the fastest pace since 2016, once again outpacing the assisted tax prep category. Within the DIY category, we estimate our TurboTax Online share grew half a point. We were also pleased to see retention increase again this year for our online tax customers. We made great progress with our TurboTax Live offering this year. The number of TurboTax Live customers more than tripled year-over-year. We also enhanced the efficiency of our pros this season, improving both the onboarding experience and technology tools for pros on our platform. This resulted in lower attrition and better operating efficiencies throughout the season. For example, we utilized natural language processing, an application of artificial intelligence, to route 100% of TurboTax Live customer questions to the optimal pro based on their type and complexity. It's this technology-first approach that gives us confidence we can expand our Live offerings and maintain attractive Intuit operating margin longer-term. And in the Strategic Partner Group, we reported $476 million of professional tax revenue in fiscal 2019, up 4%, the high-end of the original guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits, and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities at the company, with an emphasis on continuing to build our AI-driven expert platform. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $148 million of stock in the fourth quarter and $561 million during fiscal 2019. We have approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, payable October 18, 2019. This represents a 13% increase versus last year. Turning to guidance. Our full-year fiscal 2020 guidance includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.35 to $6.45, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.50 to $7.60. Our Q1 fiscal 2020 guidance includes revenue growth of 9% to 11%, GAAP loss per share of $0.02 to $0.04, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.25. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% for fiscal 2020. You can find our Q1 and fiscal 2020 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thanks, Michelle. To recap, we had a great year and couldn\u2019t be more excited about the future as we head into fiscal year 2020. I want to thank our employees, customers and partners for their contributions. I look forward to sharing more with you about the evolution of our strategy at our Investor Day on October 3. As a preview of what you\u2019re going to experience at Investor Day, let me remind you what matters most to our customers. All of our customers have a common set of needs. They are all trying to make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save money and pay off debt. And those who've made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs and go into business for themselves have an additional set of needs. They want to find customers and keep customers, they want to get paid, access capital to grow and ensure their books are right. That's why our mission is the Power Prosperity Around the World, and it\u2019s why our One Intuit Ecosystem focuses on unlocking the power of many for the prosperity of one. The evolution of our strategy is to become an AI-driven expert platform. This is about becoming an open, trusted and easy-to-build-on platform where we and our partners solve the most pressing customer problems and deliver awesome experiences. It's about significantly accelerating our application of Artificial Intelligence, which progressively learns from the rich data sets across the platform. To bring this strategy to life, we are applying Artificial Intelligence to accelerate speed to benefit, revolutionizing our customers' experiences. We're also solving one of the largest problems customers\u2019 face, lack of confidence by connecting them with experts on our platform. And in doing so, we're a leader in digitizing the services industry. At the same time, we're helping customers make smart money decisions using Artificial Intelligence and by connecting them to financial experts. For small business owners, we are focused on being the center of small business growth, using Artificial Intelligence across our platform to expand the problems we can solve with our offerings. And last, we aim to disrupt the mid-market with a robust QuickBooks Online offering that grows with our customers. We had a great year in fiscal year 2019, and we're excited for what fiscal year 2020 holds. Now with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions to hear what's on your mind. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much and congrats on a great fiscal year. Sasan, I actually just wanted to get maybe an update on QBO Advanced and how do you feel that's going thus far and kind of your expectations for that in fiscal 2020, I guess, juxtaposed against the 30% growth you expect in the Online Ecosystem for next year. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Hi, Kirk. First of all, one of the focus areas for the company is about focusing on disrupting the mid-market which we define as 10 to 100 employees. And this segment is not new to us, we've serve it for years with our Desktop Enterprise platform, and it's one of the reasons why our desktop revenue is held up the way it has. We've made quite a bit of progress with QuickBooks Advanced and we're actually encouraged by what we see. We've built out the offering, we're iterating literally on a monthly basis, we've built out rules and permissions, batch invoicing that allows our customers to invoice at the rapid speed plus priority circle, and we're focused on just being deliberate about go to market and what's most effective. So we do like our progress and we believe that this is a promising opportunity for us as we look down the road. Kirk Materne : Great. Thanks very much. Looking forward to seeing you at the Analyst Day. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much. Congrats on a great year, and congrats Jerry on a great run, and congratulations all around to Kim as well. So thanks for taking the question. Sasan, can you talk about your confidence for 9% to 10% consumer tax growth next year, and how much of that is driven from continued adoption in TurboTax Live? And perhaps what were some of the things you've learned when debriefing from last season? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Hi, Brad. Thank you for your question. First of all, I'll take you back to our strategy, which is about expanding our lead in the do-it-yourself category, about transforming the assisted category and really about disrupting traditional consumer finance. And our view is that we are at the very, very early innings of transforming the assisted category. It\u2019s a $20 billion category over 84 million customers, and we believe with an agnostic platform where we can match our customers to financial products and benefits, we're just getting started to be able to really deliver benefits and unlock smart money decision for our customers. And that's really holistically what gives us confidence in the guidance that we provided around the 9% to 10%, and we feel like with the combination of expanding our lead in the do-it-yourself category by really penetrating deeper in the assisted category and beginning to deliver really benefit beyond taxes to our customers that\u2019s not only do we have confidence in the guidance, but also as we think about our long-term expectations that we've set of 8% to 12%. Brad Zelnick : Thanks so much. And if I could follow up one real quickly for Michelle. Just on consumer margins, your investments in TurboTax Live are clearly paying off, but as we think about the margins having been flat, do we see going forward a point where the margin on Live relative to core TurboTax balance is out to where we should eventually see it expand? Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks for your question, Brad. First of all, I'd say our big focus, as Sasan was saying with TurboTax Live, is really focusing on solving the customers' problems that we have there. And then next, I would say, one of the things we have done when we look at our approach to a services business like TurboTax Live, it's really we come with a technology first approach. And so we are increasingly able to solve those problems by using AI and that enables us to really be able to maintain a good margin there. And when we've had some early success with what we're doing with TurboTax Live and that gives us confidence as we think about this going forward. For example, you saw this past \u2013 just this season, we were able to increase the customer base 3x while keeping basically the same number of pros year-over-year. And so, we'll continue to look at innovations that enable us to better use AI in that space. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Brad. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Bank of America. Your question please. Kasthuri Rangan : Yes, from Bank of America. So, in terms of the QBO business, I think the second quarter in a row, I think the ASP has been growing nicely in the mid-single digit. Can you just help us walk us through what are the drivers that help you with that growth? And how should we think about the ASP growth in that business long-term. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Hi, Kash. Thank you for your question. First of all, I would share with you that, we don't really focus on ARPC. What we're really focused on is the customer problems that we're trying to solve and all the services and the potentials, whether it's payments, payroll, time tracking, QuickBooks Capital. And now, with our focus on going after non-consumption with QuickBooks Live connecting people to experts and focusing on disrupting the mid-market where our customers generally have 10 to 100 employees, where the ASP in the past has been upwards of $2,000. When you put all that in the mix, really our focus is delivering for our customers and the guidance that we\u2019ve provided you all that we want to grow north of 30% online revenue. And so what I would say is, that's really what we are focused on and the ASP is really just a result of some of the decisions that we would make. So I would just hold us accountable for our Online Ecosystem revenue growth being greater than 30%. And that allows us to manage strategically in the marketplace to deliver for our customers. Kasthuri Rangan : Got it. So I have a follow-up on the tax business. Obviously, there are many drivers in the tax business, you have a pre-filing, you have TurboTax products, premium services. But if we were to think about what are the various drivers of growth for tax next year. Does it follow the same process of this year? How do you think about the industry growth, your share growth? Maybe some color on that, what\u2019s going to be helpful. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Just very quickly as you know our focus is expanding the lead in the do-it-yourself category, transforming assisted and again disrupting consumer finance. And we typically think about IRS returns, the growth of IRS returns, the growth of the category, and then our share growth in the category and then ultimately our ARPC. And as we communicated last year at Investor Day, we continue to assume that the IRS number \u2013 IRS returns will grow. As category champions, we have confidence in growing the category and our focus is making sure that we can increase our share. And then with TurboTax Live, we have a huge opportunity to deliver for customers, deliver significant benefit at their place of home or office at a disruptive price, but that disruptive price for customers is the higher ARPC than the normal TurboTax Online. So the drivers are consistent with what we've talked about last year and it's just we're one-year better than we\u2019re this time last year and we have confidence in the guidance that we provided. Kasthuri Rangan : Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Your question please. Rakesh Kumar : Hi, this is Rakesh Kumar sitting in for Jen Lowe. Your guidance for 12% to 14% Small Business revenue growth is slightly better than ASC 606 guide at this time last year. But we have seen some moderation in U.S. QBO subs it has been a meaningful driver of revenue growth in recent years. Are there any other areas that you see coming in as more meaningful growth driver this year as that U.S. QBO sub growth starts to moderate? Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Rakesh. Thank you for your question. First of all, I would say that the goal line we want you to focus on is our Online Ecosystem revenue growth being greater than 30%. And the reason that's important is, one, we're focused on acquiring customers, whether they're Self-Employed with QBO, now with QBO Live, which has higher ARPC and with QuickBooks Advanced. And then based on our customer pain points, wanting to get paid, wanting access to capital, wanting to have access to payroll, we have a breadth of services that our teams have been improving significantly year-over-year, which is why it's so important to stay focused on the goal line of online revenue greater than 30%. And with that said, I would actually say that when you look at our fourth quarter QBO, it did not moderate versus this time last year, it actually we accelerated growth. So we feel good both around the customer growth in QBO, but more importantly the services that we're providing and the fact that we believe that it will continue to allow us to grow north of 30% for our online revenue. Rakesh Kumar : Great. And then if I could add a follow-up. Some companies have noted weakness in Australia and UK where you have some exposure. I was wondering if you could comment on the macro environment in international region. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. There's a couple of things that we look at. We look at strength in consumer spending, is the charge volume the same growing or declining in our base. We look at our Small Businesses, are they spending at the same amounts with one another, because they buy and sell to one another and then the number of employees that they hire. And we've not seen in our data that we look at any weakness in any of those areas and/or any macroeconomic impact in the countries that you mentioned, we don't see any of that in our data. Rakesh Kumar : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Sasan, just on SMB, where do you think the lowest hanging fruit is from your perspective? There are a couple areas that you're particularly excited about the next year. And Michelle, I wanted to go back to Brad's comment on the broader margin. And this'll be now the fifth year in a row with margins roughly in the 33% range. And I know you're focused on the topline, but at some point, how do you think about the fall through on margin? Do you believe that over time that that 33% that's been a ceiling if you will for the last four years or five years, does that not become a ceiling at some point going forward? Sasan Goodarzi : Hey Brent, maybe let me take on the question you pose for me and then I'll turn it over to Michelle. First of all, I'm incredibly proud of our team across the company in Small Business, which translates into several areas that I'm excited about because they're squarely focused on what matters most to our customers. I would say services is one bucket. Our team is really focused on how to ensure our customers can get paid fast, how do they ensure that they can seamlessly pay their employees and hold onto the money the long as ensuring that they can get access to capital when they need it. And also time tracking which is good for accuracy and compliance. So I'm excited about the work our team is doing in the bucket of services, which translates into payments, payroll, time tracking, and QuickBooks Capital. And the second thing is although very early innings, really excited about being able to penetrate non-consumption with QuickBooks Live. One of the biggest pain points our customers face is confidence. Can I do-it-myself, which is why they typically engage with accountants pros enrolled agents, both in Small Business and to get their taxes done right. And this is where we are building out a platform where we can connect experts to people on our platform that really allows significant penetration into non-consumption. So I'm very excited about that and of course then the opportunity that we have as we look into the long-term disrupting mid-market, where the customers are overserved and then they overpay and we have an opportunity to serve them with a platform that's very easy to use at a price that's very, very disruptive. So those are the key areas that excite me about Small Business, not only in this coming year, but as we look ahead in the next several years. Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Brent. Thanks for your question on margins. We've got confidence in the strong guidance that we have, we've got revenue growing at double-digits, we\u2019ve got op margin in the 30s as you said with 20 to 40 bps of expansion, and that is in line with our financial principles that we have. And we really do not see any structural issue or any feeling. It is very intentional on what we're doing. And as for where we're investing, we're allocating on investment dollars across the company, across our portfolio and really looking at the areas where we think there are the highest yielding opportunities to continue building on our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform. And that's why we say we manage margins at the company level because it enables us to put that next dollar in the place where we can best drive customer and revenue growth, and that's what we continue to be focused on. Brent Thill : Thanks. Good luck Jerry. Jerry Natoli : Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Kenneth Wong : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first for you Sasan, last year you guys were really aggressive pursuing the free market. Just wondering as we look to 2020, should we think you guys harvesting those units or should we expect you guys to again focus on bringing more customers into the franchise? And then from Michelle, you mentioned AI has delivered some leverage in your TurboTax Live business, how should we think about your investments here as far as adding incremental reps or can you continue to do more with the same number of professionals? Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Ken, thanks for your question. I would share with you that we have been very assertive in delivering for our customers and especially the simple filers with the focus on free, and I would take you back to even my years at TurboTax Live, joined TurboTax seven years ago, we launched Absolute Zero, where our customer can get \u2013simple filers to get all their taxes done by paying nothing. And that's been a very strategic focus for us for years because really we're focused on expanding our lead in the do-it-yourself category and then transforming the assisted category and ultimately helping these customers connect the financial products that are right for them. Whether it's better savings accounts, better credit card rates, better home loans, better personal loans, which is what we're focused on dealing with Turbo. So this is just really \u2013 as we think about the future, it's a continuation of focusing on customer benefits, what matters most to our customers, free will be a very important element of that, but it's not new, it's been the case for years, and we expect to continue to focus on what matters most to our customers as we look ahead. And we take all of that into account when we think about the long-term expectation for this business of 8% to 12% and specifically the guidance that we've provided of 9% to 10% for next year. Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Ken. Thanks for the question. If I think about TurboTax Live and as I mentioned the AI innovations and then you asked about adding more reps. What I would say is will we need to add more agents more experts to help? Yes. What we really are focused on is continuing to use AI to drive productivity and efficiency, so that there isn't a need to add in a linear fashion as we look at the units. This past year some of the things specifically we did as I mentioned, I'm using it to manage call volume. We've also been doing other types of productivity for TurboTax Live, optimizing our scheduling and set up so that there's a better experience for the pros on the platform and really modernizing our operations. And so all of those in conjunction with artificial intelligence innovations that we have, we do see us being able to really digitize our services there, like I said, a technology first standpoint and not needing to add agents in a linear fashion. Kenneth Wong : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Michael Turrin : Hey there. Thanks. Good afternoon. I was hoping we could go back to the continued confidence and 30% plus Online Ecosystem growth as that run rate continues to scale, specifically focusing in on the mix of services. Sasan, you provided some useful metrics in terms of payroll, but is there anything else you can add in terms of contribution? And then maybe secondarily, is there a house view at all and the opportunity there to layer on additional services over time? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Hi, Michael. Thank you for your question. We are I would say at the early innings of what's possible with services. I'll just use payments as an example. Our customers send over 214 million plus invoices and there's like 14% e-payment enabled. And that's just one example of demonstrating the opportunity. And so when we think about pain points for our customers, getting paid access to capital, paying their employees and being able to hold on to the money the long as, time tracking especially with employees being out in the field. We see with just those four offerings a significant opportunity I had to deliver for our customers. And by the way that becomes even more important when we serve mid-market, which is the segment with 10 to 100 employees. With that said, one of the focus areas that we framed earlier is around being the center of Small Business growth for our customers, really shifting from being the source of truth for your books, the source of truth for your business. And an additional area that we are focused on is really about transforming omni-channel commerce. How do we ensure that the 40% of the customers out there that are product-based businesses ensuring that they can sell their products on multiple different channels, but more importantly being able to understand their sales with the profitability of customers connecting that to their inventory. That's another leg that we are focused on. That's in earlier innings than even QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advanced. But to your question of other opportunities, there are, but actually don't want us to lose focus on the services that we already have and the significant opportunity that we have to penetrate deeper into the base that we have to deliver benefits for our customers. And those are all the things that gives us confidence around being \u2013 having the ability to deliver more than 30% Online Ecosystem revenue growth. Michael Turrin : That's great. Maybe just a quick follow-up for Michelle on CapEx you\u2019re guiding for a fairly significant step up in fiscal 2020. Anything specific to call out there in terms of what's driving that increase? Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks for the question Michael. No, I wouldn't \u2013 we've typically said that our CapEx would be about 2% to 3% of revenue and in FY2019 you saw that in FY2020 you see about the same. In FY2019, we did have a little bit of CapEx that slipped out of the year. Some of our sites that we are making some improvements on, how construction projects sometimes work. We had some of that that actually was just the timing and it had moved into FY2020. Michael Turrin : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau of William Blair. Your line is open. Matthew Pfau : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask a follow-up on the QuickBooks Live. Maybe you can just give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of interest level on both the demand and the supply side for it. And then in terms of pricing of the product, it seems like currently it's between $400 and $500 a month. Is this sort of the go forward model that you're going to leverage? Or are there still other pricing options that are on the table? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Hi, Matt. So we're excited about the potential of QuickBooks Live. I just want to remind us we are in the very early innings. The reason we're excited about this is there's a huge unsaid customer problem, which is about confidence. And the confidence is really around the notion of do customers feel like they can do it themselves versus just stick with what they're doing Excel, Google Sheets, Dropbox, and all by the way, dealing with their Bookkeeper and Accountant. And so really that the problem we're going after solving here is the confidence problem to give them confidence that they can use a digital platform to run their entire business. And at the click of a button, be able to have access to a bookkeeper through a chat box or through a live conversation through a very set of experiences that they may need. So I'll give you an example, I was actually in Boise this past week visiting our TSheets team and sat for several hours listening to multiple QuickBooks Live calls because we've got some of our bookkeepers actually set up in Boise. And the particular experiences that I was listening in on were, in essence, customers that have come into our bookkeeper, said hey, here's all of my documents digitally, can you set everything up and then I'll check in with you in 48 hours and can you just tell me how my business is doing? And it was incredible to watch a customer really understand their net income for the first time, really understand their expenses, where they're spending their money and actually getting educated by our bookkeeper on how to run a business, but then learning QuickBooks at the same time. And so I used that as an example of \u2013 it's a really large opportunity to go after non-consumption to truly become the advisor to our customers because small businesses are technicians and what they do well, a hair salon, welder, plumber, they don't actually know how to run a business. And so QuickBooks Live gives us the opportunity to either deliver the experience that I just shared or actually use QuickBooks yourself, but then engage with a bookkeeper if you have questions along the way. Like, hey do I have enough money to increase my inventory? Should I borrow money? And those are the different experiences that we're delivering based on the different needs that we are learning about. And the biggest area that we're focused on is actually how to solve demand. Supply will be the easier part because this is where an AI-driven expert platform strategy comes into play. A lot of the pros that we hire for TurboTax Live also have the capability to deliver the experiences that our QuickBooks customers need. And by the way because of the fact that we have very high net promoter, we're creating income for pros. They're actually knocking at our door wanting to be on the platform. So the supply side is really the least of our focus areas. Although we're solving it through technology, it's really nailing how to solve the customer problems. Specifically then around your question around pricing, we're doing a lot of testing and in fact you'll see something different on our website in three weeks based on a bunch of testing that we've done. So I wouldn't take what you're seeing as the go forward pricing. We're kind of exactly where we were in TurboTax Live 2.5 years ago, testing demand based on different experiences for our customers. Hopefully that answers your question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Preetam Gadey : Hey. This is Pree Gadey for Raimo Lenschow. I wanted to get a little bit more color on payroll. Can we get an idea of where we are in terms of penetration for self-serve? And can we expect another 35% type growth in FY2020? And finally, how much the TSheets help in terms of growth this year? Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you for your question. We view payroll and with the combination of TSheets as a continued opportunity to move looking ahead and really in context of continuing to deliver more than 30% online revenue growth. And the biggest interest that we're actually seeing in payroll is full service payroll where our customers want to outsource everything to us, because it actually is more accurate, better compliance, and actually it's a higher ARPC for the company. Coupled with TSheets, we've been working on integrating TSheets and payroll because if you put yourself in the shoes of a customer, they have employees out in the field. And what they really need is mobile devices with GPS that allows them to track when the customer starts on a job or an employee starts on a job, when they end on a job that automatically getting dumped into payroll. And that not only delivers significant accuracy compliance and monetary value for our customers, but also it\u2019s a revenue opportunity for us when you look at the combination of payroll and TSheets. So we believe in this area, we continue to be at the early innings. We don't share what the penetration numbers are, but we liked the 35% growth that we're seeing in payroll. Preetam Gadey : Thank you. And if I could get another quick one in. You guided consumer 9% to 11% last year around this time and we're starting off this year a little bit lower, which I was a little surprised with TurboTax Live being a bit more involved. Can you guys go through kind of the thought process into that guide of 9% to 10% for the year? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. First of all, we did guide 9% to 10% last year and our guide this year is very consistent with last year. And secondly, I had a lot of confidence in the progress in the business. We've got crystal clear strategy around expanding the do-it-yourself category. We are at the very early innings of transforming the assisted category with over 20 billion market size and 84 million customers, and at even earlier innings, disrupting consumer finance. And so I feel great about our progress. It's the second year in a row we delivered double-digit growth in the Consumer Group and love what the team is doing and feel good about our guidance. Preetam Gadey : All right. Thank you and congrats on the great numbers. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your question please. Jackson Ader : Great. Thanks. Hi guys. It\u2019s Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. Our question is about the tax law changes that went into effect for 2018. So this is \u2013 the tax season coming up, it's going to be the second full tax year with some of the changes. So you expect that maybe people are more comfortable with their return this second go around? And so we could maybe see a little bit faster unit growth, but maybe on simpler packages or lower price packages this year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you for your question. First of all, we're huge fans of anything that can be done to simplify taxes for consumers so it gives them the ability to do their taxes themselves. The second thing is last year tax reform was new, which means some of the changes in the product lineups were also new to map up with some of the changes. And the second year will always be better and easier because the customers will have more confidence. But our \u2013 we've not baked any of that into our assumptions. We are focused on making the experience so drop-dead easy that we can get to a place where taxes are done and it doesn't matter what tax reform has been implemented, but that most of your taxes are done for you when you come in. And all of that has informed the guidance that we've provided in the year. Jackson Ader : Okay. That's all we had. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Christopher Merwin : Okay. Thanks very much for taking my question. Also my question about guidance, but more as it relates to Small Business and Self-Employed. I think last year you guided I think 9% to 11% and ended up doing 15% this year, and this year you\u2019re guiding 12% to 14%, so just in terms of where you sit right now relative to last year. Maybe if you don't mind just talking a bit more about what's driving that optimism at the start of the year. Is it QuickBooks Live? Is it Online Advanced, international, maybe some combination? Just curious what you see as main drivers? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, Chris. Thanks for your question. It's all the above, it's really the \u2013 as a result of the great work of the team. Just looking back over the last several years, really being clear about how we convinced customers to come to us and then how we deliver a great first time use experience. So it's the combination of having the ability to be able to have an offering to serve the Self-Employed to be able to have the QuickBooks platform that could serve customers that had less than 10 employees, but then now having a platform where we can disrupt the mid-market by serving small businesses that have between 10 to 100 employees. And then it's the services. We've been really focused on how do we ensure our customers can get paid fast? How do we ensure they have access to capital? How do we ensure we automate time tracking? Ensuring that when it comes to payroll, not only is it an easier process and experience, but also being able to hold on to their money the longest. Because, typically, small businesses, the money goes out of their bank account with earning payroll seven days in advance. And now we have same day and next day payroll. So it's the combination of really understanding what's important to our customers, being able to serve our customers from 0 to 100 employees, and really improving all the services that we provide. And we have high hopes for QuickBooks Live in the coming years to really be able to go after non-consumption, being able to connect our customers to experts. So it's really the combination of all of that that gives us comfort in the potential of the business. Christopher Merwin : Okay. That's great. And maybe just to follow up on services. Can you just remind us a bit about your strategy of white labeling verse developing your own products there? I mean, do you ever see it start to do invoice pay or tax automation on your own? Just curious how you think about doing one or the other? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. I'll take you back to our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform and the platform is truly about being an open platform, because we're customer back and customer first. And I'll use payments as an example, we want \u2013 and what's important to our customers is, they want to get paid the way their customers want to pay them. And so we provide options, whether it's PayPal, whether it's Square, whether it's our own payments offerings, we provide those options to customers to ensure that they can use our platform to run their business. Because the more we can get our customers to use our platform to run their business, whether it's an app that's been made or created by Intuit or an app by one of our partners, we ultimately care about the benefit for customers. So we have over 600 apps on our platform. I've been mentioning more the core ones, but even in the area of payments, we have multiple payment providers on our platform, PayPal and Square being one of them. So ultimately, all of our decisions around the apps on our platform is around being an open platform and as customer back. Christopher Merwin : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hi, Sasan. I wanted to ask you a little bit about TurboTax Live. Obviously, had success this tax season. I'm wondering as you look at the numbers in TurboTax Live, what percentage of customers come from either traditional TurboTax or other digital players versus the assisted market. Just trying to figure out how much TurboTax Live is encroaching on the assisted and how much success you are having getting assisted customers to convert? Sasan Goodarzi : Hey, Kartik. Thanks for your question. It's kind of an and, and all the above. As you know, there is a lot of churn within the assisted category and even those that come from the assisted category to do-it-themselves, what we reported at Investor Day last year, of those 10 million customers that kind of go back and forth between the category. So TurboTax Live really does several things. One, if you come into TurboTax and you had a question. Something changed in your life, you bought a home, you got married, you had a baby, your uncle is now sleeping on your couch. Those little questions drive a lack of confidence and can drive someone out of the category. And now on a click of a button, you can get help in any way, which way, shape or form, even if you didn't pick TurboTax Live, you can actually go into TurboTax Live from the product that you're in. So one, it really helps with final conversion, helps with retention, which is all driven by confidence. We also have seen and will talk about this more at Investor Day, more conversion coming from prior year assisted, because these are folks that are coming in for the first time, they're used to engaging with a human being on the other side to get their taxes done and now they can come in, and again, with the click of a button they can get the help that they need. So it's an end, it's all the above, because there's so much churn back and forth within the categories and between the categories that this really is going to go after the heart of what matters most, which is confidence. Kartik Mehta : Michelle, I know there's been a lot of discussion about margins. I wanted to get your perspective on that. You're obviously using AI and other technologies to make all the products better, but especially the TurboTax and QuickBooks Live. So is there a situation right now where you maybe investing more in these technologies? And as a result, maybe it's impacting margins. And then in a few years, the benefits will really start accruing? Or is this something where you think the investment will level, will stay the same? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Kartik. Thanks for the question. We are investing in AI/ML. As I said last year, actually at Investor Day, and gave the example of the five big investment areas for us for FY2019. AI/ML was one of them as was our migration to the Cloud, TurboTax Live and so forth. It is one more of, I would say, it's more of prioritization. So we are absolutely seeing the productivity impacts on TurboTax Live abusing AI, we're seeing the benefits to the customer, from a customer experience standpoint in our products, both in Consumer Group and in Small Business. But if you're thinking of that afterward are we going to be done or leveling off in a couple of years and then therefore some of that will flow to the bottom line. From our standpoint, we follow our financial principles and it's really every single year looking at what is the best use of the cash we have, and where can we invest it in a best way to drive customer and revenue growth. I wouldn't think of it so much as we're going to be done with investing and then therefore we just want to invest those dollars anymore. Kartik Mehta : Thank you, Sasan and Michelle. I appreciate it. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Josh Beck : Yes. Thank you for the question. I wanted to ask about International. It seems like the QuickBooks Online subs there may be accelerated to the high 50s from the mid 50s in the last couple of quarters? So anything inflecting or that you'd call out in terms of the success you're having there? Sasan Goodarzi : Hi, Josh. Yes, I would touch on two things, talent and our global playbook. By the way, the same thing applies also to our services and the progress that we're making in services, which is just really adding great team members that are focused entirely on pain point that matter most to our customers. In this case, we have structured international such that we have international leader that owns delivering for our customers international and owns growth, which means that, he's able to ensure that we allocate the proper resources, the proper focus across the portfolio of countries to ensure that we're going after the biggest customer impacts and the biggest growth opportunity. So the investment in just talent and people really has made a difference. The other is, we now have a global playbook where several years ago we step back and we studied our own history, the decisions that we made, the mistakes that we've made, what worked, what didn't work, we studied others that are in our space. We also studied others that are global players that are not in our space, interviewed them, understood their playbook and that will inform a playbook that we now have, that we are following. I think it's a combination of having a very systematic playbook, being very deliberate about resource allocation and the talent of that, just giving us the ability to maintain this kind of growth rate at a far larger base than even when we were a couple of years ago. Josh Beck : Okay. Great. And if I could ask one follow-up on consumer. You talked a bit about the opportunity beyond tax and, obviously, almost tripled the number of Turbo users. So maybe just help us understand what you're imagine is when we think it's going to be with other services that you could add to Turbo users? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. The biggest problem that our customers face beyond making sure that they get, especially, in the United States, the largest check of the year, which is the tax refund, is making ends meet. This is about being able to pay off debt and savings money. And most of folks, and I'll just use U.S. as an example, are under duress when it comes to how do I put food off the table? How do I pay my bills? How do I ensure that I've got close on my kids back? And so our focus is really to help our customers make ends meet by really being an agnostic platform that matches our customers to products that are right for them. So if I just paint the picture of what this looks like is, imagine a tax time helping our customers find the highest yield savings account, where we're not pushing a financial product, we're helping them understand the best financial product. It's helping connecting them to a personal loan at the best rate versus because the financial institution only providing one rate. It's helping them understand their credit score and the actions that they can take to improve their credit score. It's to understand how to best get an auto loan before they go by the auto, so that they can actually save money. So it's really \u2013 and those are just illustrative examples. But based on the customer consents, letting us use their data to deliver benefits for them, we can, in essence match them the benefits that could really help them prosper back to our mission of powering prosperity around the world. So that's our focus. And we're excited about the fact that we have 14 million customers that we're testing with in terms of what benefit make the most sense for them. From a revenue perspective, very early innings. But from a focusing on what matters most to our customers, which is where our focus is right now, we're excited about the possibilities. So that's kind of the picture of what it would look like. Josh Beck : Very helpful. Thanks Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. And congratulations, Jerry and Kim. And good work all. My first question on retention, I heard online tax retention improved. Michelle, if you could just put some color around that? And maybe if you could delve into some categorization and actually touch upon what you saw as far as retention over in TurboTax Live? If you don't want to share some numbers, maybe some anecdotes either one of you. Thanks so much. Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Scott. Thanks for the question. As we looked at this year, one of the issues that we know, we've had just with customers overall, when you think about TurboTax when they're going through to complete their return is, they're going through, they leave confidence. And so that's one of the reasons why we've been very excited about TurboTax Live is, it gives us an opportunity to provide an expert who can really provide that level of confidence to someone so they can complete their return and opens up the assisted market for us. And so, we had, number one, as I said, hope to pull people in from assisted, number two, hope to keep people in the category overall. And so, as we said, we have seen increases in our TurboTax Online retention for this year. We haven't given any additional details on that. You might get some more information around that in our Investor Day on October 3, but right now, we haven't given any additional information. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Fair enough. As a follow-up, just a lot of cash on the balance sheet right now, it looks like you're going to generate a lot of free cash flow next year, even though you have slightly tweaked up CapEx. It just kind of curious, I mean, you saw the smaller acquisition in the quarter and obviously, a very nice dividend increase, but still it looks like you're going to have a lot more cash at the end of next year, then you do right now at this buyback pace. Just curious, I know your typical approach to it, but what's your view of what type of cash or what amount of cash you want to carry? And might we see a step-up in spending or returning or what have you? Thanks. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks Scott. I would say, yes, we do have more cash than year, but none of our financial principles have changed, our M&A strategy hasn't changed. And so our approach is really, we step back, we look at our financial principles and then we see what makes sense to us. When we look at our investments, we absolutely want to invest that cash in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. And then we will look at acquisitions to fill out our products road maps and then we will return cash to customers. I mean, excuse me, to shareholders that we can use profitably in the business. And we have those financial principles that are in place and we will continue to follow those. We have not changed those. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. First of all, thank you so much for joining. And again, a huge thank you to our employees for an amazing fiscal year 2019. We're very excited about 2020, and we look forward to seeing all of you at Investor Day. Until then, thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins., Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's first quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after the call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thanks Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're off to a strong start through the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and continue to make progress on our strategy of becoming an A.I.-driven expert platform. First quarter revenue grew 15% overall, fueled by 15% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 35%, exceeding our target to grow 30% or more. Consumer Group revenue grew 11% and Strategic Partner Group revenue was in-line with our expectations.  This is a great start to the year. At Investor Day, I shared our top five priorities, which we call our big bets. These big bets focus on the largest problems our customers face, and also represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. I'd like to share our progress on each of these. Our first bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit for our customers when they use our products and services. We aim to deliver instant benefit and make the interactions with our offerings frictionless by accelerating the application of Artificial Intelligence. This big bet is foundational to everything that we do for our customers and positions us to accelerate execution across our other four bets. Here are a couple of examples of the progress we're making. First, we are on a path to triple the number of customers who can apply for working capital loans through QuickBooks Capital by extending eligibility to our desktop customers using machine learning. QuickBooks Capital leverages customers' data to provide loans to small businesses, nearly 60% of whom may not qualify for loans elsewhere. Second, we're enhancing our ability to answer customer questions more efficiently through TurboTax self-help. By leveraging A.I., we are delivering more relevant answers at the point of need and using natural language processing to expand personalized answers with TurboTax Assistant. In fiscal 2019, we handled millions of calls from customers needing help while using TurboTax. We expect this capability to improve customer satisfaction survey results and reduce customer contact rates by helping customers find answers to their questions more easily. Our second big bet is to connect people to experts. One of the largest problems our customers face is lack of confidence - to do their own taxes and to manage their business. We're connecting customers to experts on our platform to solve this problem, allowing us to gain share and grow average revenue per customer or ARPC. We are happy with the progress that we are making. We launched QuickBooks Live, connecting small businesses with live experts, opening up access to a new $10 billion market opportunity. This offering is intended to increase our small business customers' confidence, helping them get set up, close their books each month and ensure their records are accurate and up-to-date. Over the last six months, we've run more than 50 tests to learn about what customers truly need, helping us develop the offering, and refine our go-to-market and pricing strategies. At the same time, we continue to build out the expert pipeline, as 90% of TurboTax Live experts expressed interest in working with QuickBooks Live. In TurboTax Live, we continue to innovate in making our experts more accessible at different touch points as we see a 32-point improvement in conversion for first time filers when engaging with an expert. This season, we're launching real-time chat, an enhancement our customers have asked for since the inception of TurboTax Live. Our third big bet is to unlock smart money decisions for customers by connecting them to financial tools, partners and benefits that help put more money in their pockets. Through our offerings, we are addressing key customer problems by helping them reduce high cost debt, grow emergency funds and improve their financial habits. Based on what we learned from the tests, we ran during the extension season, we are optimistic about our ability to go beyond tax to help our customers make ends meet. For example, we introduced credit score goal setting and payment history tracking in Turbo to help customers improve their credit score. This is a key step to improving their overall financial health. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth, by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence. We introduced new QuickBooks innovations at our flagship QuickBooks Connect conference earlier this month, to further support our customers' small business growth. For example, we announced a cash flow planner to help our small business customers make better decisions as they grow. We also announced receipt capture in the mobile app and enhanced mileage tracking, to enable our customers to automatically deduct expenses seamlessly. All of these innovations put more money in our customers' pockets, and should increase their success. Over time, we see the opportunity to better serve product-based businesses by transforming omni-channel commerce, benefiting customers who sell products through multiple channels. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. This offering will help us increase retention of these larger customers, and attract new mid-market customers who are over-served by higher-priced competitive offerings. We continue to make progress building out the offering since launching last year. For example, we recently introduced a revenue streams dashboard that allows customers to easily compare revenue across products and services, projects, customers, employees and other attributes to better understand their business performance. In summary, the entire company is focused on executing against these big bets to deliver for our customers and accelerate growth. Before I hand it to Michelle, I want to address the questions we've been getting on our free strategy. While the debate continues around whether the government should present a tax bill, or taxpayers should prepare their own returns, our primary focus remains on meeting our customers' needs, helping them maximize their tax refund, and going beyond tax to help them make ends meet. Let me give you some additional context around free. Based on IRS estimates, nearly 104 million Americans are eligible to file for free through the IRS Free File program. However, that number doesn't tell the whole story. Recently the IRS asked an independent organization, MITRE, to conduct a study of the Free File program. The study concluded that overall the Free File program was effective and that the majority of these 104 million taxpayers make a personal choice to use an alternative filing method for a variety of reasons. For example, many taxpayers - regardless of their income or complexity - prefer to have assistance as they lack the confidence to file on their own. As a result, the study concluded that the actual number of filers using DIY software and eligible to use Free File is roughly 30 million customers. Over 20 million taxpayers are already filing for free, either through Free File or commercial free offerings including many not eligible for Free File. And roughly 13 million of those Americans filing for free used TurboTax software and paid Intuit nothing. This is a testament to the quality of our free offerings \u2013 both the product we donate to the IRS Free File program and our commercial free offering. We offer millions of customers the option to file for free because we believe they will stick with us over time as their life changes and their tax situation becomes more complex in the future. Therefore, we remain very confident in our durable free strategy. So wrap up, we are very pleased with our results in the first quarter. And we remain focused on delivering against our objective in fiscal 2020.  Thank you. And now let me hand it over to Michelle to walk you through the financial details. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered revenue of $1.2 billion, up 15% year-over-year. GAAP operating income of $10 million, versus a loss of $10 million a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income of $129 million, versus $102 million last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22, versus $0.13 a year ago. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.41, up from $0.29 last year. Turning to the Business Segment Results. In Small Business and Self-Employed, revenue grew 15% during the first quarter, fueled by Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 35%. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Starting with grow the core, QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 41% in fiscal Q1, driven mainly by strong customer growth, and to a lesser extent higher effective prices and mix-shift. Second, we continue to make progress connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue - which includes payroll, payments, time tracking and capital - grew 27% in fiscal Q1. Within QuickBooks online payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds from a mix-shift to our full service offering which is priced 75% higher than self-service. Within QuickBooks Online payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q1. Total international online revenue grew over 60%. I am also excited to share that in the U.K., we now hold the number one position for cloud accounting subscribers. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy going forward is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we continue to expect to grow better than 30%. Desktop Ecosystem revenue was up 1% in the first quarter, in-line with our expectations. Note that the first quarter is our largest desktop quarter of the year reflecting the annual launch of a new version of QuickBooks desktop software. Consumer Group revenue grew 11% in fiscal Q1. During the October tax extension season, we ran three times the number of tests we did two years ago. These tests will inform our tax offerings for the upcoming season. We're gearing up for our third season offering TurboTax Live. We're continuing to test new customer experiences as we work to provide our customers an even higher level of confidence this season. We are also seeing great engagement from experts, and over 90% of those we asked back plan to return this season. Our technology-first approach gives us confidence we can expand our Live offerings and maintain attractive Intuit operating margin longer-term. And in the Strategic Partner Group, professional tax revenue grew 6% in the first quarter, in-line with our expectations. We've gotten a lot of questions about the macro environment and what we're seeing in our business. At this time, we're not seeing any evidence of a slow-down in our business related to the macro-economic environment. Charge volume trends remain strong, and the number of employees being paid in our ecosystem remains on trend. Turning to our Financial Principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits, and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities at the company, with an emphasis on becoming an A.I.-driven expert platform. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $139 million of stock in the first quarter. We have approximately $2.5 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, payable January 21, 2020. This represents a 13% increase versus last year. Turning to guidance, our Q2 fiscal 2020 guidance includes revenue growth of 11% to 13% percent, GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.73, and Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.00 to $1.03.This earnings guidance reflects a shift of marketing investments for Consumer Group into our fiscal second quarter. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% for fiscal 2020. You can find our Q2 and fiscal 2020 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thanks Michelle. As I shared with you at Investor Day, all of our customers have a common set of needs. They are all trying to make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save money and pay off debt. And those who've made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs - and go into business for themselves - have an additional set of needs. They want to find and keep customers, get paid, access capital to grow and ensure their books are right. We remain focused on becoming an A.I.-driven expert platform, to solve our customers' most pressing problems.  Now let's open it up for questions to hear what's on your mind. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Ken Wong of Wong - Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Kenneth Wong : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm not sure if this goes this Sasan or Michelle, but Michelle towards the end you mentioned that you guys are going to bring some marketing spin into 2Q. Can you help us understand just based on your learnings from last year what kind of returns you guys are looking for? What are some of the areas, channel wise or other that you guys might be putting this money behind? And when we think about kind of that incremental spin, is it fair to assume that that's pretty much just all sales and marketing and not kind of other line items? Sasan Goodarzi : Hey. Thanks for your question. This is Sasan. First of all, it is all pretty much marketing and it's really focused on ensuring that we can raise awareness to transform the assisted category. As we've talked about before, really last year was our first year in raising awareness in terms of you can do your taxes and we'll be there every step of the way for you, and we can help you. We're really doubling down on that this year and based on the behaviors that we learned last year, we felt that shifting more dollars to raise awareness early in the season and throughout the season will give us the opportunity to serve as many customers as we can. So that's really the primary driver for it. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. I'll follow up on the second quarter guidance question just on, it sounds like it's entirely pull forward of marketing spend that has an adverse impact in the second quarter uniquely. I was just curious what is your expectation for the start of the tax season? I don't think the IRS has announced it yet. I'm just curious what type of -- what you're expecting and how that affects the 2Q guide? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : First of all, you're absolutely right. It's all marketing based on what I just described earlier. And what we expect based on customer behavior and when the IRS opens is that just like we've seen in previous years, the moment the W-2's hit the door, those early filers are going to be ready to file and we're going to be there for them. I want to make sure that we raise awareness that they know we're ready for them, and that they can have help if they need it. And then two, give them the ability to be able to file their taxes and get their refunds right away. And so we're really obsessively focused on our customers and making sure that they're ready to file the moment the IRS opens. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks Sasan. And any just not looking for much of a change in a year-over-year as far as the start of the tax season now just to the extent you can answer that. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Not really much of a change other than again what we've learned and what we're going to do differently from an execution perspective. We don't expect much of a behavior change and that's all of what has informed our guidance for the quarter, and we remain of course committed for the year. Scott Schneeberger : All right. Thanks very much on that. And then I recently attended the QuickBooks Connect, it's very dynamic event for sure. I was just curious if you could give us an update, Sasan, comparing and contrasting what you're seeing thus far with QuickBooks Live customers and/or staff, well not and/or and staffing relative to it when you initiated TurboTax Live? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Well, first of all, thank you for attending QuickBooks Connect. I was truly blown away by just a number of innovations from our team, and they use QuickBooks Connect as the opportunity to launch many of innovations across many fronts. And of course inspired by our customers and their passion. We actually use QuickBooks Connect as really an opportunity to activate QuickBooks Live. We had thousands of accountants and pros there and there was a great opportunity just to share the fact that we're solving a two-sided platform or a two sided problem I should say and the opportunity they have to solve those very problems on our platform for our customers and generate more income. And I would tell you in the two sessions that we did it was standing room only with folks knocking on the door after they got their questions answered to figure out how to participate on joining the other platform. In terms of customer insights and learnings, we ran over 50 tests in the last six months both in terms of really getting the product market set thinking through, go-to-market and pricing strategies. And we feel that we're really positioned for something that's very early in its journey going into busy season, helping customers get set up, providing help along the way when they need it. And in some cases doing it for them. So we're excited heading into busy seizing in January knowing that our primary focus is to learn. But so far both on the pro side and customer demand side, it's been exciting to watch. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Wells of Citi. Your line is open. Matthew Wells : Hi, Sasan, Michelle. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about the customer cohorts that are purchasing QuickBooks Advance? Are they existing desktop ecosystem customers or they net new to the -- net new into enter the platform? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. The primary focus that we have are our customers that have between 10 to 100 employees, but that's not --it's not a hard line. It really depends on the number of customers that they have. The number of invoices that they have to do. The number of accounts payables that they have, and just a scale in which they operate. And so far and our primary focus has been ensuring that we take care of our existing customers. Those that are ready to upgrade to a platform that can better serve them and perform for them. While we build our capabilities to also acquire new. So we've seen about a 75%, 25% mix, 75% existing customers upgrading and 25% new. And over time, we expect that to evolve a bit because we want to actually accelerate the acquisition of new customers that we have. As we've shared before, there's about 180,000 customers within QBO base that are a fit for QBO Advanced. And so our primary initial focus in the coming kind of year and 18 months as our existing customers. But that's the mix we're seeing so far when new customers find out that we have the capability. They're just naturally coming over to the platform. Matthew Wells : It's really helpful color. And switching gears to the consumer segment, with the pull forward of marketing spend are there any specific products you plan to lean into here? Is it going to be focused on TurboTax Live or some of the lower tier SKUs? Sasan Goodarzi : It's all the above. Our teams have worked really hard this year in context of enabling us to expand our lead in doing yourself category, enabling us to transform the assisted category and going beyond tax and finding ways to provide benefits beyond tax. And so really the focus areas has been self employed. It's been Latinx. It's been improving our experiences for those that have that investments and stocks allow at the same time making sure help is available through TurboTax Live for all the cohorts. So really what we've learned in the last couple of years is all customers seek help from day one. And so we're ready to provide that both through if you want to do it yourself or through live. Well at the end of the tax experience helping you understand that there's ways to save money. There's ways to connect to financial products that are right for you to get out of debt over time. So we're really ready on all those fronts from day one because what we've learned is customers have those needs from day one when tax season opens up. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Mark Randy : Hi. Mark Randy here on for Keith Weiss. Thanks for taking my questions. So first maybe on QuickBooks Live. How much of the existing QBO base do you think will be interested in that? And kind of just how traction have been going and do you expect this to be a material contributor to revenue growth this year or maybe next year? Any color on that would be helpful. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. First of all, important reminder that we're very early in our journey with QuickBooks Live. Literally, we just went GA and use QuickBooks Connect to activate it and we're excited about what more we can learn. So it's very early in the journey. There are a lot of similarities to TurboTax Live and the similarities are because of customer behaviors. The largest problem our customers face whether it's a consumer or a small business is confidence. It's confidence whether or not they're making good business decisions. Whether they need access to capital? Whether they're going to be able to make their payroll this coming week? How to think about profitability for their customer?  So it's really a confidence problem and the confidence question that they have, which means that this will apply to a cohort and a portion of our existing base, plus it's really an opportunity to penetrate non-consumption. A lot of customers that sit on the sidelines and use Google sheets and Excel and then just use a pro to help them run their business. This becomes the potential trigger for them to switch. And we're seeing all of that. We're seeing existing customers opts for help. And we're seeing new customers that are come in opting for either getting set up or engaging for help along the way because they need advice. So thus far we're seeing it across the spectrum. We really have not accounted for this to be a material impact for our revenue in this coming year. Again, we are --this is we are early in the journey, but this is one of the company's five big bets and we believe that it's a huge customer problem, and a big growth driver for the company in the future. Mark Randy : Great. Thanks so much. And maybe one more quick one. On the UK subscribers where you now hold the number one position. Can you talk a little bit about the driver of that growth? Is like the making taxes digital acts still a big tailwind and how do you see that trending, I guess, for the rest of the year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. I am extremely proud of our team. Five years ago, we weren't even on the map in the UK and they set a goal to maniacally focus on customers getting to product market fit, and when we do making sure that we really execute against our go-to-market strategies and raise awareness. And I would say, it's their hard work and focusing on product market fits. It's gotten us to the number one position because making taxes digital has been an opportunity for everyone. But our team has really done an incredible job nailing the product experience. Of course, we always have room to improve and really accelerating marketing investments and now our expectations are to really hold that number-one position to continue the growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Your question please. Jennifer Lowe : Great. I think this one is a Michelle question to start with. But given the commentary of international growth being greater than 60%. If I look at some of the metrics we've got in the past, namely international subs growth in the high 50s, I think at Analyst Day last year or earlier this year it was discussed that average revenue per customer is actually down in international. It feels like that's an acceleration, but I'm not -- I'm also comparing apples and oranges a little bit. So maybe just can you comment a little bit on that? How should we sort of put 60% north to 60% growth in the context of some of the metrics we've gotten in the past and what that trajectory looks like? Michelle Clatterbuck : HI, Jenni. Yes. The total international online revenue growth for Q1 was 60% and obviously a lot of that was driven through the UK. As Sasan just mentioned, with the move into first with online accounting subs in the UK that has been a driver of the revenue growth. We're very pleased with what we're seeing. We do believe that international longer term is a large opportunity for us. Right now the revenue from international is still a very small portion of our overall. But we are seeing the UK picking up steam there and we would expect that to continue. Jennifer Lowe : Okay, great. And then just one more on QBO for me. You mentioned subs growth being the majority of the driver, but also higher effective prices in QBO, and there's a few reasons why that could be. But can you just give us a little color on what is driving that higher effective price and what the durability of that might look like as we move through the year? I mean is it just sort of one up in pricing or is it mix? Or what -- how should we think about that going forward? Michelle Clatterbuck : We are really pleased when we think about small business. We have the three pillars to the strategy of grow the core, connecting the ecosystem and expanding globally. And we're pleased with the growth we saw in grow the core with online accounting in Q1 of 41%. Of the majority of that was driven by customer growth, the vast majority of that. Part of that to a lesser extent that was our higher ARPC, the higher effective prices there that is some price increase, but it's also lowered discounting. And then we also had the impact of some mix shift, the higher price products which is like QBO Advance. That's really was driving that. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Yao Chu : Hi. This is Yao Chu on for Brad Zelnick. Congrats on the quarter. Just I had a question on competition here. H&R Block seems to coming out earlier this year on pricing in a very aggressive way especially on free online, where they continue to message the differentiation from TurboTax. Any initial comment on that in terms of pricing, especially in the free SKUs? And is this related to the pull forward in marketing spend in the next quarter in any way? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, thank you for your question. Our choices and investments are really focused on our beliefs around what we can execute against and really grow the category and grow share. It has not anything to do with any choices that H&R Block has made. And I mean I can't comment on the choices that we've -- that they've made, but I have a lot of confidence in the choices that we've made and our focus as we head into see them. Yao Chu : Great, thank you. And the second question here, just moving to the UK again, congrats on the number one position. Can you remind us of the offering there internationally, is payroll and payments available, has QBO Live or Advanced started to scale or if so, when would these be made available on an international basis? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. So, in terms of what's available in the UK, it is our QBO platform and we have app partners that solve some of the most pressing problems for our customers. The primary problems around payment employees like payroll and payments is all through partners. So we do solve those very important problems, but they're all through partners. Our intent is ultimately to roll out QuickBooks Advanced and QuickBooks Live in the UK and beyond. There are critical opportunities to solve customer problems and they're drivers of growth for the future. So we're -- we've been very deliberate about getting the product market fit in the US while the platform is global-ready in building the capabilities to roll this out globally and UK and then Canada will be the first stops. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Hi, Sasan. Nice to see the UK in the pole position. If you look at other surrounding international countries in kind of stack ranked where you're most excited. Could you walk through where you are on, maybe, perhaps to where some areas that you wish you'd -- you're making bigger improvements that you think that may take a little bit longer time, but are there any other markets that you're seeing that could be in the UK position here shortly? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, sure. Well, first of all, just as a -- if I could remind all of us that, outside the US we're in UK, Canada and Australia where we've gotten the product market fit and then there are emerging markets that we're focused on which is France, Brazil and India. And we are excited about the UK, but we are very hungry because I think we just think we're getting started in the UK, especially to solve customer problems in a way that will drive revenue growth. Our focus has been growing our customer base and growing share and now it's about accelerating to build a big business over time. So that's from just -- if I could paint a picture of where we are in the UK, I would just say, we're just getting started in terms of the opportunity ahead. And I would say we're in the same place in Canada. The growth in Canada, based on just the market dynamics is a bit slower, but the same opportunities still exist in Canada. And so, those are two markets where we believe that there is an opportunity for, over time, contribution to revenue growth. In terms of the emerging markets, the two that we are continuing to see progress, it's not yet material from the lens of how much it contributes, but we're excited about is France and Brazil. We're seeing really good traction in France. We're seeing good traction in Brazil. Those are markets that are very different, but the opportunities are, in the long term, ones that we like. And India is one that we continue to focus on product market fit. We have not made the progress that we would want to see us ourselves make in India and we're really still searching for product market fit. there, but when I look at UK, Canada, Australia, France and Brazil, I just view that we have good opportunities outside of the US and it's sufficient and we're being very intentional and deliberate in India in terms of the deliverables and what we're focused on to see if we can get the product market fit. Brent Thill : And just a quick follow-up for Michelle. Nice earnings beat. Was there anything that didn't get spent that you were hoping to spend that it seems like you're maybe pushing some things around that maybe that marketing spend didn't get fully flush through in Q1 that goes to the next quarter or is it -- or was it not the case? Michelle Clatterbuck : No. For Q1, we really didn't see much of that. As we called out, we are pulling in some of the marketing expense to Q2 for the Consumer Group, but when you look at our Q1 and what we were trying to accomplish there, our spend was pretty much where we had anticipated it to be. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan, your question please. Sterling Auty : Yes, hi, thanks. I actually want to follow up on that last point. If we look, obviously, you overperformed very nicely out of revenue, but just given the operating income guidance that you gave, it does look mathematically like you under spent on total expenses in the quarter. So, maybe not in marketing, but was there anything else in cost of revenue or something else that led to the total expenses coming in shy of what the operating income guidance would have implied? Michelle Clatterbuck : When we really look at our guide for the year, I would continue to encourage you to look at the guide for the year. When we look at our spent I don't get really concerned with quarter-to-quarter. There's always going to be some quarter-to-quarter shift in some expenses. And so, that's why I would continue to focus on the total year. We did reiterate the year for our guide. And so, yes, there is always going to be a little bit of movement between quarters. That's just something that I don't get overly focused on because we really do look at the total year and the total Company, and not worry too much about the individual quarters. Sterling Auty : That's fair. And then Sasan, you talked about some of the big bets and initiatives, I didn't hear. One of the things on QuickBooks was to help the product-based businesses, specifically with consolidating orders, I think was the imperative. Any update on that initiative? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. So one of -- as you suggested, one of our bets is about being the center of small business growth. And one element of that is to be really be able to transform omni-channel commerce. And our focus, first and foremost, we do have a roadmap of what problems we want to solve and when, and the first set of deliverables are really about enabling customers to see all their orders in one place. So if they sell on Etsy, if they sell on Amazon and then if there is orders coming in from their own website, one of the biggest challenges that they had is actually seeing everything in one place and then eventually understanding their profitability in having a tighter inventory. So the first step in terms of what our teams are focused on is delivering that on the road map and we've not yet delivered it. But we're excited about the clarity that we have in terms of what we need to do for customers and then a road map that we've got the right team behind. So we'll certainly, on a quarterly basis, provide an update to you all, but we're excited about the progress that the team is making. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Kevin Kumar : Hi, this is Kevin on for Chris. Thanks for taking my question. We see a lot of third-party solutions in the QuickBooks ecosystem, including acquisitions Intuit has made such as TSheets. I guess as the growth focus shifts more toward revenue per sub, does it make more sense to do strategic acquisitions to more fully monetize the ARPU opportunity? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Our principles really are clear in terms of what guide decisions that we make. First and foremost, it's about what's most important to our customers. The second is actually being able to solve that extremely well. And then the third is really assessing whether it's core versus context and how critical it is to the masses. And if its core, like TSheets is a great example of -- although we were partners with TSheets, what we learned and found out over time is that time tracking is very core to us. And the reason it's core to us is that it's a big input into automating the data that we get and therefore how we leverage the data applying artificial intelligence to it to really deliver more innovation for our customers. And so those are the principles and then drive whether it's partnership versus acquisition. It's less about just monetization. Of course, monetization matters over time. But first and foremost, it's about customer problem, can we solve it well and is it core versus context and then we let that drive whether it's a potential build acquisition or if it's a partnership. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Yes, thanks very much. Sasan, I wanted to circle back just on QuickBooks Connect and maybe just some of your takeaways, I guess, in terms of when you look at QuickBooks Live, in particular, what are maybe some of the things we should think about that could either help throttle adoption faster, the things that maybe people are sort of worried about or things you think some of the accounts just have to kind of get more comfortable with to maybe see some real acceleration in adoption? I'm sure you're expecting good adoption already, but just kind of wondering if you had any quick takes on that in terms of some of the questions you were getting back more specifically? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, absolutely. If I could start with broader context. The whole purpose of QuickBooks Connect, which is something we started about five years ago was really to bring the ecosystem together. It's the ecosystem of our partners, our customers, our employees and really leveraging it as a launching pad from new innovation for training for our customers actually providing best practices in terms of how do you grow your firm, how do you go your practice, how do you grow your business. And it's something now that we stream outside of the 5,000 folks that attended, really, as a platform to launch big innovation, teach how to grow your business and it's a huge opportunity for us to learn. And so, at QuickBooks Connect there was a number of things that we launched, whether it's the line-up for payroll and some of the new innovations around auto pay, integrations to TSheets or cash flow planning where a small business can now understand their cash flow issues, plan for their cash flow so that they can make better decisions, which is the number one reason why small businesses go out of business, to many innovations and launches on the accountant platforms, how the accountants do a better job running their business and running their firm. So I wanted to start with a broader context of those many aspects of, and in many areas across the platform where we shared new innovations across the board. Specifically on QuickBooks Live, although we ran 50 tests over the last six months and have been in market and learning along with making sure that accountants are aware of our narrative of what we're trying to do here, we really use QuickBooks Connect as an activation platform. And I would tell you that once we got through these two standing room only sessions, there was incredible excitement about being part of the platform, because ultimately, they have the ability to grow their income, grow their practice and serve customers and do something that they don't like, which is marketing. We also addressed concerns because if you are not aware of the narrative as an accountant, you have a natural concern, which is, is Intuit trying to compete with me and is Intuit trying to take business away from me? We believe, by the way, that will always be a concern that will be out there until we get our narrative to every single pro and enrolled agent and accountant that's out there. And so we were excited about QuickBooks Connect because we were able to address some of those questions, some of those concerns face to face. And we had, by the way, well over 1,000 folks that wanted to sign up on the platform after those events, which, by the way, blew us away. We did not have those high of expectation. So net-net, this is a two-sided problem. The most important of solving the problem for small businesses and solving the problem for pros, which is helping them grow their practice. And we feel good about what we're learning. We feel good about our progress and QuickBooks Connect was a great activation event. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great, thanks very much. On TurboTax Live, do you expect to increase headcount this year? Sasan Goodarzi : Well, let me start with, we are still very early in the journey of TurboTax Live. As we've talked about before, there are 86 million folks that go to someone else to have them do their taxes for them. It's a $20 billion opportunity and we just got started a couple of years ago. And so our number one focus is customer growth and we're very focused this year on first time use additional access points so that you can get access to experts and improving the experience for experts. We do expect to increase the number of pros because now we're actually -- it's both for QuickBooks Live and our TurboTax Live. And actually that's where being a platform and leading this in a digital way really comes into play because it's about having experts for both platforms. But we do expect it to grow it. We do not expect to grow it in any way, shape or form as fast as our revenue will grow, but being very intentional to ensure that we have enough people to serve our customers. And I think I would just remind us that this is a technology-driven expert platform, which means that we're really applying AI to efficiently and effectively deliver experiences for our customers and that we do not see this as a impact on margin at all this year or beyond. Brad Reback : Great. And then just on one unrelated follow up, with the Windows 10 upgrade cycle looking to abate in the first half of calendar '20, should we expect that to have any impact on the desktop business post that? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : We have not included any expectations of that sort in our guidance, nor do we expect that just from an execution perspective, but, of course, we're ready for our customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of RBC. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question about QB desktop. And it had a really strong quarter in Q1. I guess do you expect that to continue? And then Sasan, how do you think about QuickBooks Online or -- sorry, QuickBooks Live as being a potential accelerant for conversions from QB desktop to QBO? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. So when we think about desktop in the long term, first and foremost, we are obsessively focused on delivering for our desktop customers while educating them on the benefits of the cloud, because they can -- over time, they can run their business in a much more effective way on the cloud, but what's important and what we've learned from our own experience is educating them on the benefits of the cloud and also educating them in terms of what's different on a cloud platform versus a desktop platform is very important because our desktop customers, whether TurboTax our QuickBooks, they love their desktop. So that's point number one. We do expect that this is a business that will decline over time. What's really kept it at the level that it's been at, has been our enterprise desktop business that's been growing double digits, but we don't -- we -- the expectations that we've shared on desktop with you all, still stand. In terms of QuickBooks Live, it certainly could be a potential catalyst. We have no proof at this point that it is, because we're really focused on our online customers. The real catalyst will be educating our desktop customers as to the benefits of online and making sure that they're prepared to make that jump. And I think we will just see a natural migration as we've seen over the last several years and QuickBooks Live could play a role. At this point, we don't have proof that it will and the biggest opportunity is really with non-consumption and current customers. Alex Zukin : Perfect. And then just as a follow-up to that on QuickBooks Live, with some of the early testing you've done and the feedback you've gathered, have you had any surprises either positive or negative that were unexpected? Sasan Goodarzi : Was your question on QuickBooks Live? Alex Zukin : Yes. Sasan Goodarzi : Got it. Sorry. You cut out on me. I would say the biggest surprise that we've had is the very number of needs that the customers have. There are customers that will come in and just say, hey, here's all of my stuff from Word, from Excel, from Google Sheets, all the receipt boxes that I have. Can you just help me get set up. So I know what's going on in my business with QuickBooks and help me understand how to then run QuickBooks. So that -- the whole notion of set up, has been a huge need for customers and then the other is actually just advice. This is my cash flow, this is my net income, now that I understand it, what choices can I make? When will I need access to capital? Is it worth for me to take out capital? Should I buy more inventory? I've sat multiple times in different sessions listening to calls between our bookkeepers and small businesses, and just the amount of reliance and need that they have to understand what's going on in their business, what choices that they have. Intellectually, we all understand it, but when you really listen to these calls you get how important advice is, how important expertise is, and how much they lack confidence. And so, that's not a surprise, but just when you listen to these calls, they just amplifies how important it is. But I would say this whole notion of getting set up and understanding what's going on in my business and how blind that they are, and what's happening has been probably the biggest surprise and the biggest need that we're looking to figure out how to solve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Josh Beck : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about QuickBooks Capital. Certainly AI in underwriting has been one of the focus areas, I think, underneath that theme. So are you getting to a point when you think about inflecting that business and grow it quicker and you think about maybe some of the ancillary announcements like you just mentioned, like Cash Flow Planner that we're may be on the cusp of seeing more loans facilitated or is it more likely to be kind of a steadier pace as we've seen in terms of the additional origination volumes? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. We use -- first of all, I'll step back and reiterate how the ecosystem works together and what we're excited about is the notion of a customer being on our platform to get organized, to be able to invoice and get paid, to be able to pay their employees and with Cash Flow Planner, actually we can now give customers insight as to whether or not they even need access to a loan, but the loan is not the only way to solve their problem. It's also, do you want -- you want us to follow up with some of your customers that are overdue to get paid, you want to slow down paying a few vendors so you can make your payroll Friday. So, the Cash Flow Planner is really to help them thrive, to help them make better decisions because they're lonely and running their business. They don't have business partners to give them analytics and Cash Flow Planner is really -- is just going to be the beginning of something that will be their -- kind of their assistant in their pocket, if I may, to then offer ways for them to run their business, access to capital could be one. The second element to get to your question, there are two ways that we provide capital. One is the marketplace. One is through our own capital where we are partnered with a blue-chip financial firm where they had no recourse, but we also have provided access in that way. And based on the growth that we see, we continue to both leverage our blue-chip partner and the marketplace. And it's all really driven by the demand that we see both on our online platform and our desktop platform. So, it's an important retention driver. Over time it could be a growth driver, but most importantly what it's doing is helping our customers thrive and be able to get through the tougher earlier years to be able to survive as a business and improve their success rate. Josh Beck : Okay, very helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up, maybe for Michelle. I noticed very modest deceleration in the Online Services growth. Should we be thinking that's driven by things like law of large numbers, obviously, international mix seems to be going up. So I'd imagine that would probably -- maybe pressure this line. So, anything to call out on the modest decel that we've seen there? Michelle Clatterbuck : For Online Services, first of all, I'd say that we continue to be focused on our Online Ecosystem revenue growth of greater than 30% and that was 35% for the quarter. In Online Services for the quarter, we did grow 27% and the two major drivers there were QuickBooks payroll and payments and then to a lesser degree time tracking and QuickBooks Capital. One of the things that I would remind everyone about which you may be seeing is that, Online Services has parts that are growing very nicely, but it also has a part of it -- about 25% of Online Services that's non-integrated payroll and payments offering and that isn't growing. And so, that's some of what you're seeing there, but we're very pleased with the growth that we've seen there and expect that to continue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacqueline Cheong of Bank of America. Your line is open. Jacqueline Cheong : Hi. Thanks for taking our question. This is on behalf of Kash Rangan. I have a couple of questions around QBO Advanced. What's the go-to-market strategy for this product and what has initial customer feedback been like? And then, finally can QBO Advanced be a catalyst for more QuickBooks Desktop customers to move to QBO? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Yes. I'll start at the top, which is, there is about 1.5 million customers in the mid-market and we define mid-market as 10 to about 100 employees and it's about a $40 billion market based on the math that we've done when you include services. And when we think about our go-to-market, our initial focus is our existing customers. We have about 180,000 QBO customers that outgrow QBO. And ultimately, they need a platform that can perform at a different level that has rules and permissions, that has integrations with CRMs that meet their needs, just as an illustrative example. And so our go-to-market is really making sure our existing customers are aware of the platform, and right now, we're actually seeing a 75% of our growth coming from existing customers and about 25% of the customers are new. Eventually over time, we are right now building the capability, we're studying the best practices externally of those that have served the mid-market very well, putting together a great talented team that knows how to serve the mid-market and then ultimately, our plan is to raise awareness top of the funnel and pursue these mid-market customers that typically by the way, are still running their business on Excel, on Google Sheets are stretched in, use multiple accountants and so we foresee the combination of QuickBooks Advanced and QuickBooks Live working very well together. In fact, a certain percentage of our current QuickBooks Live customers are QuickBooks Advanced customers. And so, when you think about our bets, one connecting people to experts and then the second is disrupting in the mid-market, they actually play very well together hand-in-hand. And what we've learned seen so far is a lot of delight from our existing customers where they see that this platform can meet their needs. Over time, it can be a source of reason for migration from desktop to QuickBooks Advanced. But right now, our main focus is existing QBO customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks. A lot of questions were answered, so I'll make it a short one. You talked -- what you talked earlier about the international and the UK, Canada, and that you are still working on market fit for India. The other two that you have done a lot of work around was France and Brazil. Can you just double click on that one where we are in the evolution there? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, for sure. So France is really where the US was about 15 to 20 years ago. There is already a financial management solutions category, primarily on desktop. Most accountants are on desktop and light desktop, but now we're seeing small businesses want to use the cloud, because they see that it's far better to be able to use a cloud platform to be able to run their business. And they are now engaging accountants to be able to pull accountants to be able to come to the cloud so they can, in essence, help them run their business on the cloud. And that's really where the US was 15 to 20 years ago. And our team has done really a wonderful job of getting the product market fit by blocks. And what I mean by that is, we're focused on a street in Paris and making sure that we nail the experiences for that street in Paris and then go to the second street in Paris. And now we're starting to expand across Paris because the fastest way to get the product market fit is one customer at a time. And so we're seeing a nice acceleration. And we foresee, given our progress that France could be interesting and material three to five years from now. And again, it's where the US was about 15 years ago. Brazil had a large compliance marketplace; it's mainly an account marketplace. Brazil is a market where they rely heavily on services. And so the likes of QuickBooks Live, if I could use that as an example, is a natural thing that they would actually go to, which is they would love for an accountant to do all their business taxes for them and to be able to provide advice for them. And so those are some of the tests that we are now running in Brazil, which is shifting more toward services because that's what the market is oriented toward. So very different marketplaces in very different place. And I like the progress of our team. But again, these are more -- think about these opportunities three, five years out from now, don't look at them as near-term opportunities. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you very much for your questions and we look forward to chatting with you at our next earnings call. Have a great rest of the day and great rest of the week. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. I am here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. We are also joined by Ken Lin, Founder and CEO of Credit Karma. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after the call ends. And with that, I will turn it call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thanks, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us. We posted strong results for the first half of fiscal year 2020. I am also excited to announce that we have reached an agreement to acquire Credit Karma, a pioneer in the financial technology sector, for approximately $7.1 billion. I could not be more enthusiastic about this transformational transaction and I am thrilled to welcome the talented Credit Karma team. Ken Lin, the Founder and CEO of Credit Karma is with us today to talk about our shared excitement and commitment to one simple goal, empowering consumers to make smart decisions about their money. We posted a slide deck on our website containing an overview of the agreement which provides more details. Let me start with a quick recap of the quarter. We are halfway through fiscal year 2020 and continue to see strong momentum across the company as we make progress on our strategy to become an AI-driven expert platform. Second quarter revenue grew 13% overall fueled by 17% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and 8% growth in the Consumer Group. Revenue for the Strategic Partner Group grew 8%. With this strong performance, we remain on track to deliver our full year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance. Let me remind you of the customer problems that we are addressing. All of our customers are consumers and have a common set of needs. They are all trying to make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save money and payoff debt and those who have made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs and go into business for themselves have an additional set of needs. They want to find and keep customers, get paid, access capital to grow and ensure their books are right. To solve our customers\u2019 most pressing problems, we remain focused on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. We are working to achieve this strategy by pursuing five big bets. These include revolutionize speed to benefit, so our customers fall in love with the product instantly; connect people to experts to improve confidence; unlock smart money decisions to put more money back in our customers\u2019 pockets; become the center of small business growth by fueling our customers\u2019 growth; and disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. Throughout the call, I will update you on where we stand on these bets. With that context, let me start with tax. We are confident in our strategy and are on track to deliver and achieve our full year guidance. As a reminder, there are four key drivers of our consumer tax business. The first is total number of returns that is filed with the IRS. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using DIY software. The third is our share within the DIY software category. And the fourth is the average revenue per return. Based on the latest IRS data and the DIY software category is performing better than assisted as it has for more than a decade. As the category leader, we view it as our responsibility to help drive category awareness and growth. So we are pleased with this result. Through February 7, IRS data shows total e-filed returns are up 0.6%, with self-prepared e-files up 3.5% and assisted e-files down 3.7%. Based on what we are seeing, our share within the DIY category is up year-over-year. We are growing the category and growing our share, which is right where we want to be. Our strategy for the Consumer Group is to expand our lead in the DIY category, transform the assisted tax preparation category and disrupt consumer finance. This is all in service of helping our customers make ends meet and get the largest tax refund. Let me share a few examples of how we are delivering for our customers this season. Within the DIY category, which is $3 billion in TAM, we are delivering enhancements to our premier offering to better serve customers with investments. We are driving faster growth in under-penetrated segments, including Latinx and Self-Employed. We are also expanding free eligibility to include all enlisted active duty military and reservists and providing historical tax return access for all customers. In the assisted category, which is $20 billion in TAM, we continue to make progress with our second big bet to connect people to experts with TurboTax Live. We are working to further increase customer confidence on our platform by enhancing first time use. This season, we improved accessibility back to experts by offering customers the option to connect with an expert when they first sign-in to TurboTax Live to address top of mind questions. We also introduced real-time chat and a floating Live Help button to make it easier to connect with live help at all stages of the return process. We continue to accelerate the application of AI to create tools for experts to automate repetitive tasks, increase efficiency and drive an even better customer experience. Beyond tax, we continue to make progress disrupting consumer finance, which represents $29 billion in TAM. This aligns with our third big bet to unlock smart money decisions. Through our Turbo offering, we are addressing key customer problems like managing debt, saving money and improving financial health overall. We are building on last season\u2019s success by expanding the financial marketplace. We are now live with pre-qualification partners offering both credit cards and personal loans to help customers save money and to provide partners with more qualified leads. Nearly 25% of our weekly active users have set a credit score, savings or debt-related goal in Turbo and we expect this to drive higher engagement over time. Acquiring Credit Karma expands our TAM from $29 billion to $57 billion accelerating our time to market moving beyond tax while also developing new ways to monetize our offerings. Now, turning to small business, we delivered another strong quarter in our Small Business and Self-Employed Group with Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 35%, exceeding our target to grow more than 30%. We continue to solve key customer pain points as we execute on our big bets. We remain encouraged with our early results with QuickBooks Live, part of our second big bet to connect people to experts, opening access to a $10 billion bookkeeping opportunity. QuickBooks Live solves one of the customers\u2019 biggest needs confidence and peace of mind, while helping experts grow their business and find new customers. We are now also offering setup help, providing customers with confidence from the moment they subscribe. We are working to achieve our vision of being the center of small business growth, our fourth big bet, by helping our customers get paid faster, manage capital and pay employees with confidence. We introduced a new payroll lineup featuring full service across all offerings as well as TSheets integration for time tracking that\u2019s resulting in customers adopting TSheets at 3x the rate they did prior to launching the integrated offering and a tax penalty free guaranteed for select offerings. We also introduced a feature that double checks customers\u2019 over time calculations, reducing the likelihood of fines and penalties. We continue to make progress on our fifth big bet, disrupting the mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. We developed this offering to help us increase retention of larger customers and attract new mid-market customers who are over-served by higher-priced competitive offerings. Approximately 75% of our current QBO Advanced customers have traded up from our existing QBO product, unlocking benefits such as faster invoicing with batch import tools, automation, more customized fields and user permissions. Now, I want to address the news we announced today to acquire Credit Karma. I have long been an admirer of the company that Ken and his team have built. As we have gotten to know each other, Ken and I realized we both share one simple goal, empowering consumers to make smart decisions about their money. This combination fits directly with Intuit\u2019s mission and long-term strategy. Our mission is to power prosperity around the world. And our bold goal for 2025 is to double the household savings rate for customers on our platform. This acquisition is a giant step forward in achieving that goal and significantly accelerates execution of our big bet to unlock smart money decisions. This big bet is aimed at helping consumers address the personal finance problems they face today helping them reduce debt, maximize savings and put more money in their pockets. Today, many consumers struggle with not knowing or fully understanding where they stand with their finances and they struggle to make ends meet. Household debt in the United States hit $14.1 trillion. 23 million consumers relied on at least one payday loan in 2018 to get faster access to cash. If consumers just had the tools to better understand their financial health and opportunities to improve it, they could unlock billions of dollars of potential savings. For example, understanding the difference and availability of lower cost personal loans versus high cost credit cards could save consumers $20 billion to 40 billion. And Credit Karma estimates that 80% of Americans overpay on car loans to the tune of $37 billion as there is no easy way to compare offerings. Consumers want to do better and 60% say they are trying to improve their credit score, but they need help. We aspire to do more and Credit Karma is the perfect partner to help us do this. Credit Karma shares our goal of making it simple for consumers to make better decisions with their money through a platform that works like a personalized financial assistant, helping consumers find the right financial products, putting more money in their pockets and providing them with insights and advice. This platform will provide consumers with transparent access to their critical personal financial information, including their income, spending and credit history to help them better understand their complete financial picture and use it to their advantage, such as obtaining better interest rates. The result will be a complete financial profile that puts the power in consumers\u2019 hands so they can take the steps necessary to improve their financial health. Let me tell you what this will look like. To find the right financial products, we will match consumers with pre-approved offers on personal loans, home loans, credit cards and insurance. We will put more money in their pockets by connecting them to higher yield savings accounts and faster access to their hard earned paycheck. We will also provide insights and connect them to experts to help consumers make better decisions about their money and improve their credit score. All of this will be done by leveraging artificial intelligence and connecting consumers to over 100 financial partners on the platform solving a two-sided problem. This consumer finance platform offers compelling value for our financial institution partners as we provide efficient access to a broad set of qualified customers. While consumers strive to be more informed about their finances and want personalized offers from a trusted source, financial institutions want high-quality leads and face real challenges matching their products to the right customers. We can help them target their offers based on metrics like verified income and credit history giving them the ability to reach qualified prospects. Ken will get into this shortly, but Credit Karma\u2019s history is remarkable. The Credit Karma platform has attracted more than 100 million members, with 88% engagement via mobile among active users and over one-third of which are active on the platform each month. The platform has a net promoter score of 69. The company recorded revenue of approximately $1 billion in calendar year 2019, growing 20% year-over-year. Impressively, over 90% of Credit Karma\u2019s annual revenue results from existing members returning to the platform. Together, we can deliver unprecedented benefits to customers, combining the benefits of scale, trust and data. Let me turn it over to Ken, Credit Karma\u2019s founder and CEO, to share his perspective on the transaction. Ken Lin : Thanks, Sasan. I\u2019m incredibly excited about today\u2019s announcement. As Sasan mentioned through many conversations we have found a real shared goal for changing personal finance for the better of consumers. When we started the company in 2007, we had a fundamental belief that consumers are being left behind in financial services innovation. We started the company with a mission to Champion Financial Progress for All with the intention of leveling the playing field for all consumers. In 2008, we launched the Credit Karma platform by providing consumers completely free credit scores. Now, 12 years later we have provided more than four billion credit scores and created a platform with over 100 million members, over a third of which are active on the site every month. Notably, we are helping a new generation better manage their finances, as more than half of our members are under the age of 44. We use the term members because our users are unique, have verified information from a third party and begin an engagement loop with our products. When we started the business we saw consumers lost in a sea of complexity and the opportunity for technology to make a difference. Today, we are leaders and our business model is quite simple : we help consumers find the right product for them based on their credit and financial profile with their consent. Intuit enables us to strengthen this ability by allowing customers to add income data to that profile, enable members to see more offers through which they qualify. Then, we simplify the application process, we help members significantly increase their probability of approval, and we help members transparently compare rates and features. We do this for credit cards, personal loans, auto lending, mortgages, high yield savings accounts, auto insurance, home insurance and other verticals to come. So this opportunity is also meaningful and exciting for all our trusted partners, to believe that and support us throughout our history. These personalized recommendations are embedded by technology, and 8 billion daily model predictions. Perhaps what I am most excited about is the real impact we\u2019ve had on consumers' lives. As one example, we have seen meaningful increases in credit scores from members who regularly engage on our platform overtime. There are many reasons why it makes sense to join forces with Intuit right now. First and foremost, we have the ability to collaborate and bring technology solutions to solve real consumer problems. We see a platform which provides consumers with transparent access to their critical personal financial information - including their income, spending and credit history - to help them better understand their complete financial picture and use it to their advantage, such as obtaining a better interest rate. Our insights will significantly accelerate Credit Karma\u2019s mission and we will then make a larger impact on our customers more quickly than either of us are able to alone. With millions of customers, more financial partners, and more resourcing, I am convinced we will be able to build a more valuable business that enables us to achieve our combined goals. I also have to say that the culture and team Sasan has put in place are critical factors in our decision to join together. We got inspired by Intuit\u2019s mission to power prosperity around the world and our team is ready to join Intuit on that journey. To each of my 1,300 Credit Karma colleagues, Karmanauts, thank you. I am deeply proud of the company we have built and the culture we have created. We worked long and hard to get to a day like this, yet as I have always said -- this is one step in our journey together. Our mission to champion our members\u2019 financial progress remains the same. Now, with our partner with Intuit, we will have the resources and capabilities to achieve our goals in a remarkable, significant and impactful way. I\u2019ll pass it back to you, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Awesome. Thanks, Ken. I\u2019d like to add that while we see a lot of innovation and investment, in the marketplace we don\u2019t see anyone with our collective capabilities pursuing a personalized financial assistant. This is why we believe this combination can transform FinTech and power the economy. We have the ability to bring together consumers and financial institutions in innovative ways that lowers costs for all those involved and levels the playing field for consumers of all economic status. After the transaction closes, Ken will report to me, and continue to lead the Credit Karma team from its headquarters in San Francisco. Credit Karma will continue to operate under its current brand. Michelle will share the financial details of the transaction in a few minutes. To wrap up, we are pleased with the continued momentum of our Small Business and Self-Employed Group. We remain laser focused delivering for our customers during tax season and I could not be more excited about the Credit Karma acquisition and the opportunity it provides us to power prosperity for our customers. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. I will start by providing an overview of financial results in the quarter, and then share more details on the proposed acquisition of Credit Karma we announced today. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered revenue of $1.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year, GAAP operating income of $270 million, a 16% increase, non-GAAP operating income of $384 million, a 13% increase, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91, versus $0.72 a year ago, a 26% increase and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.16, up from $1.00 last year, a 16% increase. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue was $499 million, up 8% for the second quarter. As we enter our third year of TurboTax Live, our technology-first approach continues to give us confidence we can expand our live offerings and maintain attractive Intuit operating margin longer term. As Sasan shared earlier, we are now using AI to automate repetitive tasks for experts on our platform, which we expect to increase efficiency and drive an even better customer experience. Based on data published by the IRS, the broader tax season got off to a slow start through January, when total e-filed returns were down 0.7%. We remain confident in our plans and guidance for the year. And in the Strategic Partner Group, professional tax revenue grew 8% in the second quarter, reflecting delivery of more forms during the second quarter as compared to the same period last year. In Small Business and Self-Employed, revenue grew 17% during the second quarter, fueled by Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 35%. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. Starting with grow the core, QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 43% in fiscal Q2 driven mainly by strong customer growth and to a lesser extent higher effective prices and mix-shift. Second, we continue to make progress connecting the ecosystem; Online Services revenue, which includes payroll, payments, time tracking and capital, grew 23% in fiscal Q2. Within QuickBooks Online payroll, we continued to see revenue tailwinds from a mix shift to our full service offering. Within QuickBooks Online payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q2. Total international online revenue again grew over 60%. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy going forward is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we continue to expect to grow better than 30%. Desktop Ecosystem revenue was up 1% in the second quarter, inline with our expectations, as QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew at a double-digit pace in the quarter. Let me now spend a minute on the Credit Karma acquisition that Sasan and Ken described earlier. Intuit has agreed to pay total consideration of approximately $7.1 billion to acquire Credit Karma, comprised of half cash and half stock. The total consideration is subject to customary adjustments and includes an estimated $1 billion of equity awards that will be expensed over a period of up to three years. We will also deliver approximately $300 million of retention equity through restricted stock awarded to Credit Karma employees that will be expensed over four years. We plan to finance the cash portion of the transaction through cash and our existing unsecured line of credit. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of calendar year 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. We do not foresee an impact to maintaining our dividend and share repurchase principles due to the Credit Karma transaction. We expect the transaction to be neutral to accretive to Intuit\u2019s non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the transaction closes. We will provide updated Intuit guidance once the transaction is closed. Now, turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. Our financial principles in total have not changed and remain a durable framework for us. We finished the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $139 million of stock in the second quarter. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our authorization and we expect to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, payable April 20th, 2020. This represents a 13% increase versus last year. Turning to guidance, our Q3 fiscal 2020 guidance includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $5.53 to $5.58, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.90 to $5.95. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% for fiscal 2020. You can find our Q3 and fiscal 2020 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I will turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Michelle. I would like to thank our employees, our customers and partners for another strong quarter. I am excited about joining forces with Credit Karma and the transformative experience we can offer customers together. We will share more about our progress in the coming months. Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions to hear what\u2019s on your mind. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much and thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the deal today, certainly, a company that we have been an admirer for a long time as well. But Sasan, if I can ask, Intuit\u2019s history includes some of the best acquisitions of all time in software and some deals that maybe were a bit less than great and with Credit Karma now the largest in the company\u2019s history, I only have two questions, why is this the right time for Credit Karma and the push into consumer finance just given the heightened awareness on data privacy and where we are in the consumer credit cycle and two, what\u2019s the approach with this asset that will be different this time? Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Hey, Brad. Thank you for your question. We are equally admirers of Credit Karma. A couple of things, I would say. Let me start with your question as to why now? This is very core to what we have declared around helping our customers make ends meet. It\u2019s very core to the strategy that we\u2019ve declared, which is about an AI driven expert platform and what we declared is that because everyone that we serve are consumers, we are very focused on unlocking smart money decisions and together with Credit Karma there are things that we can do to benefit consumers that we believe are significant. First and foremost, consumers are in significant debt. They over pay on fees whether it\u2019s credit cards, whether it\u2019s home loans, auto loans whether it\u2019s insurance. They don\u2019t have access to advice in terms what are the things that they need to do to improve their credit score and their credit rating which matters a lot, so when it comes to the interest that they pay and also just the other side of it, which is how do they save money and how do they ultimately grow that money and in order to really be able to deliver against that, what we bring together with Credit Karma is scale and capability, it\u2019s scale of customers and scale of customers\u2019 data and it\u2019s the capability that we have and so ultimately now, customers are going to be able to leverage their own data, their income data, their spending data, their credit history, their life situations. I mean, together with Credit Karma, the customers will have access to all their information in one place and then we\u2019ll be able to match them with financial products that are right for them. We\u2019ll be able to connect them to savings accounts. We\u2019ll be able to help them get early access to their pay check and we will be able to provide insights and advice so they can actually continue to improve their financial habit. So in terms of why is this the right time. It\u2019s absolutely core to what we\u2019ve declared, its core to the goals that we\u2019ve set, and we believe that together we can truly do things that benefit consumers and benefit financial institutions because we will provide them also more choice. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s the right time. I think in terms of acquisitions, I would just say that the last several that we\u2019ve made have been extremely successful and we\u2019ve actually held them up as role models internally and we\u2019ve recently talked to our board about it. TSheets [indiscernible] just two of the latest three and the reason is we\u2019ve studied our history and we\u2019ve learned what works and what doesn\u2019t work and the clarity that we have around three things that matter, one is the mission and purpose \u2013 the alignment that we have with Ken and the team; two, the absolute alignments that we have on priorities; and third, and I would say equally as important is Ken is in charge. Our goal is to fuel his success and Credit Karma\u2019s success and just how we\u2019ve organized around the work is essential to the success. So across the board, we have a lot of confidence and are very clear about how to manage the risks. Brad Zelnick : Sasan thank you so much for the very thoughtful answer. If I could just sneak in one for Ken, Ken, can you talk about the concept of autonomous finance and why being on Intuit\u2019s platform can help to accelerate that vision? Thank you. Ken Lin : Yes, absolutely. So thanks for the question. So autonomous finance right is really our ability to help consumers automate their financial life in a way that reduces friction, increases uncertainty, and creates more transparency and efficiency. So if you look at the problems that exist today, most consumers don\u2019t know which are the right products for them, they don\u2019t know how to apply for those products and there\u2019s so much friction to making it happen. So for us, our platform is really predicated on integrating with financial institutions so that you can make it easy, moving the dollars or automating the process itself, so it does not require as much work and therefore friction and then lastly, adding a layer of education to consumers to understand what is absolutely best for them and if you do that, we fundamentally believe we can level the playing field for the most disadvantaged and most vulnerable consumers and assist them. Brad Zelnick : Thanks so much. Congrats. Ken Lin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys and thank you for taking the question. A question on the sort of the overlap within the product lines between Credit Karma and in the TurboTax line. How should we think about that on a going forward basis? Credit Karma does tax and has a pre-tax offering obviously TurboTax does a lot of tax. I always thought of Turbo as a competing solution to sort of the core Credit Karma solution in terms of giving people more visibility into their financial health and giving offers. So Credit Karma is going to be a stand-alone. It\u2019s going to exist as a separate brand, is it going to be competing offerings under the same umbrella of Intuit or how should we think about that product overlap on a go-forward basis? Sasan Goodarzi : Got it. Great. Thank you, Keith for the question. Let me just start with tax, our intent is to keep the free tax software within Credit Karma because we believe in what they are doing and the fact that customers should have choice and we are not doing this deal because of tax. They have 106 million customers and really we are doing this because we believe that we can truly create a consumer finance platform that can serve as a financial assistant to really power the prosperity of customers. So that is really the strategic rationale and reason for the deal and we will continue to offer taxes for free through Credit Karma and through TurboTax and we\u2019re very confident in that go-forward approach. In terms of Mint and Turbo, I think I would go back to what I shared a moment ago with Brad. We are very focused on helping customers make ends meet and we are very focused on unlocking smart money decisions for our customers and ultimately, this is really about speed the market. This is really about bringing the capabilities of the two companies together, the scale of the customers\u2019 data and capabilities to be able to move much faster to help these customers that are really underserved, struggling and are looking for help and that\u2019s really the rationale for why we are doing this and specifically around Mint and Turbo, our game plan over time is actually to combine that into one app and we want to focus entirely on Credit Karma\u2019s growth and we don\u2019t actually want to distract Credit Karma at all with the fact that there is Turbo and there is Credit Karma. The reality is customers have choice and they\u2019ll be able to pick the product that\u2019s right for them. Sorry, go ahead. Keith Weiss : So just to be clear, will the Mint and Turbo apps, will those consolidate into one app with Credit Karma or is there going to be a separate Mint Turbo app and a separate Credit Karma app. Sasan Goodarzi : No, no, they will be \u2013 ultimately, they will be separate. They will not be combined into one app only because I think our focus is we have a huge opportunity to ensure that we can fuel Credit Karma\u2019s growth and we don\u2019t want to have any distractions other than ensuring that they can deliver for customers, so they will be separate apps. Keith Weiss : Okay, that\u2019s clear. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes and Keith, just a note on Credit Karma, I think from our perspective, we\u2019re neither a credit score company nor are we a tax company. We focus on solving consumer problems. So for us, our members who are coming to us asking for credit scores are really asking for how can they borrow at the best rates possible and on the opposite side of that when consumers are coming to us from our tax product, it\u2019s really about getting their dollars back from the government and sort of doing the necessities. So we think of that not as a product per se, but really the problems or the challenges that we\u2019re solving on behalf of our members. Keith Weiss : Got it. And if I could throw in one follow-up for Michelle. To get to a neutral to accretive situation with Credit Karma, is there any synergies you are assuming on that either on the revenue side or the expense side of the equation or is it just the profitability of Credit Karma today can get you there on an accretion basis. Michelle Clatterbuck : When we look at Credit Karma, they really bring a big track record of success with the beyond user paid business models. They have revenue of approximately $1 billion in calendar year 2019, which was growing at 20%. They\u2019ve reached scale with high engagement, robust marketplace. We are really not able to share any of the profitability information at this point in time, but we do feel good about their platform model and the company\u2019s commitment to really serving and engaging their members. And then as we stated, we do believe that we will be in a neutral to accretive our position in our non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the transaction closes. Keith Weiss : Got it. Alright, thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Robert Simmons : Hi, this is Robert Simmons on for Alex. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about the results so far in season for Live, surely it won\u2019t triple again this year, but how is it tracking? Sasan Goodarzi : We are actually very pleased with the progress and the results that we\u2019re making. I mean, first, I would start by saying, as the category leaders, our focus is to grow the category, which we feel like we\u2019ve had a large part in doing so given what the stats I shared earlier that the do-it-yourself category is growing faster than assisted and we have been able to increase our share and a driver of us being able to increase our share is the continued traction and growth with TurboTax Live and we are very pleased with the results that we\u2019re seeing and it\u2019s in line with what we would expect through this early part of the season and I think I would just remind that we are so early in our journey of going after this $20 billion market of transforming the assisted marketplace that we expect continued accelerated growth from TurboTax Live given that it is a seamless platform for customers to use at the ease of their home or office and they can get access to expertise at anytime they wish throughout the experience. So we are just at the beginning of the journey of what\u2019s possible with TurboTax Live. Robert Simmons : Got it. Great, thanks. And then, have you noticed any competitive change from others doing similar things such as H&R Block? Sasan Goodarzi : I can\u2019t comment on H&R Block other than I really love what we\u2019re seeing in our results, we are growing the category, we\u2019re taking share and we are seeing the growth that we would have expected in TurboTax Live and continuing to benefit from our focus around the first time use, more access points for experts, and making the expert platform easier that gives us the opportunity to ensure efficiency and expanding margins over time. So we \u2013 and by the way, we also have experienced that more folks that enter the category, the more we\u2019re actually able to accelerate the growth in the category. So far, what we are seeing is exactly what we would have expected. Robert Simmons : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thank you. This is a John [ph] for Brent Thill. Congrats on the deal again. I just wanted to add another question on that and that was the first question, but I think some of the questions that we\u2019re getting, is this a signal at all of maybe anything in your core business slowing, is there any slowdown or does this really just open up an adjacent market with a lot of new opportunities for you? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, this is about acceleration. The way you should think about this is we get to expand our TAM, we are acquiring a business that has incredible capabilities of $1 billion growing 20% plus with a platform model that has the ability to grow operating margins over time and frankly, more importantly, all of that is possible because we are able to do things for consumers and provide them more choice and more benefits and do the same for financial institutions. I would look at this as, it\u2019s squarely focused on one of our five best that we declared and it\u2019s all about acceleration while we continue to see acceleration really connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live, QuickBooks Live, and some of what we\u2019re doing on the small business front. So this is about acceleration. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your question please. Ken Wong : Great, thanks for taking my question. Maybe first back to the Credit Karma\u2019s transaction, I think we all understand what great brands both TurboTax and Credit Karma and we see maybe the long-term synergies on the consumer side. Just wondering is there any benefit to or from your small business division that we might be missing in terms of how it might interplay with this transaction here? Sasan Goodarzi : Let me start and I\u2019ll have Ken add. One of the things that we\u2019ve been very intentional and working with Ken and the team on is alignment on purpose and vision, alignment on priorities, and ensuring that Ken is in charge and has what he needs to be able to deliver for customers and accelerate Credit Karma\u2019s growth and so we believe that there is an opportunity serving small businesses, but ultimately over time, Ken will decide when is that right time because ultimately we want to \u2013 there is so much opportunity ahead of us, but let me let Ken jump into that because I know he\u2019s been thinking about small businesses for some time. Ken Lin : Thanks, well, if you think about what Credit Karma does from a business model perspective, it\u2019s again providing consumers with the certainty of finding the right products at a great rate and some of the best rates in the market. That same problem exists for small business users and historically for Credit Karma is how it\u2019s been challenging to determine who are small business owners, I think that\u2019s an opportunity for us to work together in the sense that we are now able to solve that problem for not just consumers, but small business owners as well. So we think that\u2019s a big upside in the future. Ken Wong : Got it. Great. And then maybe a follow-up just on, you did go through some of the tax dynamics this year, but on that fourth driver, ARPU, you guys didn\u2019t really run into that too much. Just wondering if you can provide some color in terms of what you might be seeing on the ARPU side especially it seems like your early marketing has less of a focus on free versus last year? Sasan Goodarzi : Well, as you know, when we talked about our long-term expectations and in essence shared that it\u2019s between 8% to 12%, one of the larger drivers of that was ARPU simply from the standpoint that we are focused on transforming assisted with our platform and there is just an opportunity to increase our ARPU. We\u2019ll share after season how that\u2019s performing, but I would tell you everything that we see so far in early season \u2013 there\u2019s results that you see because there is three days to four days of IRS opening, which is very a small portion of the results and there is what we see you through year-to-date and season to date and it\u2019s really in line with what we had assumed and again, we like what we see. Ken Wong : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Yes, thanks very much and I\u2019ll echo the congrats on the acquisition. Maybe starting there Sasan, I think it makes tons of sense in terms of the strategic vision and why you also want to leave Credit Karma on its own to continue its growth. However, on the back end of the businesses, there is obviously a lot of potential synergies in terms of the data you\u2019re both collecting, the ability to apply AI to that to drive greater synergies for both. So how are you thinking about sort of the independence factor versus some of the maybe combined benefits of bringing the businesses together from a data perspective? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Thank you, Kirk for your question. Let me kick this off and I\u2019ll let Ken chime in because the business plan that\u2019s been developed has been jointly developed that will be executed after close. First of all, as I mentioned, there is alignment around mission and purpose and we\u2019ve also aligned around priorities. The priorities that we have aligned around is grow the core, it\u2019s expand growth verticals and it\u2019s developing emerging verticals and specifically, grow the core is really about growing credit cards and personal loans. Expanding growth verticals is about auto and home loans and insurance and then developing emerging vertical is really about providing offerings like savings, checking and then over time early access to your paycheck, etcetera . So those are the three priorities that we have agreed to. Now, what\u2019s wonderful on behalf of consumers are the capabilities that we can bring together and so the first is creating a financial identity for the consumer. What that means is the consumer now based on the data that we have the 50 million customers and 106 million customers that Credit Karma has, the consumer now has access to their data in one place, their income data, their spending data, their credit history data, their life situation. I mean, Credit Karma has 2,600 data points for each of their customers on average and so creating a financial identity for the customer so they can use their data for their benefit is one thing that we will do together. The second is making our money movement capabilities, the services available for Ken and the team. That\u2019s all of our risk and fraud capabilities that we use for same-day payroll, same day payments, all of that is necessary for Ken over time to be able to provide early access to consumers\u2019 paychecks as an example. And then last but not least, we will make our financial data platform capabilities and services available to Ken so he can deliver benefits to customers and this is where we have 20,000 partners in our financial data platform where, again, all of this will be used with the customers consent and to their benefit. So when I talk about allowing Ken to be in charge and running Credit Karma, we will make those data elements and services with the customers consent available on the back end so that ultimately Ken can deliver more benefit for Credit Karma customers over time and that\u2019s where we see the acceleration and we don\u2019t want to distract Ken and Credit Karma with anything else other than what\u2019s most important to deliver for customers. So that\u2019s the approach that we\u2019re taking. Ken Lin : Yes. And maybe just to give you a little color on how you actually turn that into product when Sasan talked about income and the financial identity. One of the things that we observe in the space is that credit is a great predictor of underwriting about 80% of the time. Income and assets is the other piece and as you may know, 81% of consumers \u2013 sub-prime consumers are declined for credit card offers. So if we actually have the full picture and the full financial identity of that consumer, we are able to provide them certainty in the space and again going back to this note of the most vulnerable people, when you apply for a credit product and you are declined, your score goes down and you get into this vicious cycle of getting into predatory lending of products that aren\u2019t good for you. To Sasan\u2019s note around the data platform, with it, we\u2019ll be able to do things like automation of our cash flow. We\u2019ll be able to audit \u2013 autonomous finance for us as moving money in such a way that you can minimize the interest that you\u2019re paying. You can move in a way that your credit score and your outstanding balances are at lowest so you can actually get those other products to help you get through life and then when it comes to you to access to the other data points, I think things like improving savings where you know approximately half the country don\u2019t have $400 in savings. We can help improve that savings rates with our ability to foster money movement. Kirk Materne : That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks for the answers and congrats on the quarter. Ken Lin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Bank of America. Your question please. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much. Sorry for my overhead noise here. The acquisition feels a little bit \u2013 it has a bit of a similarly to Microsoft acquiring LinkedIn where Microsoft bought a network and so you guys are buying effectively a network and Sasan and team, I\u2019m just curious to get your thoughts on how we should think about the TAM \u2013 so the Intuit TAM has been a very simple one, TurboTax units multiplied by ASP, you add value, etcetera same thing with QuickBooks and this is a very different monetization model. I\u2019m curious to get your thoughts on how the monetization model I mean conceptually, I get the story, but from a long-term standpoint of building a multi-billion dollar business, how do we think about the monetization from a dollars and cents perspective. I\u2019m curious what synergies can Intuit bring to Credit Karma that Credit Karma could not do for itself? Thank you so much and congratulations again. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Kash. Let me hit on a couple of these and then I\u2019m going to ask actually Ken to jump in and just share more around the business model. First of all, this is really one view of having a network effect. It\u2019s truly solves a two-sided problem. The more consumers consent with their data being used at more financial institutions and others participate on the platform, the stronger the platform gets to deliver for the end consumer, the more choice that it provides and so from a network effect perspective, this has some of those characteristics. In terms of synergy, it\u2019s really what we were just describing earlier, really what you are now able to bring together with the two companies is the customers\u2019 entire financial identity where they can use their data to get access to the best personal loans that are right for them, the best credit cards that are right for them, the best by the way, insurance, it could be home insurance, auto insurance, renters insurance because when the customer doesn\u2019t have all their data in one place, they in essence have experiences that Ken was just talking about earlier where they may get something where they are pre-approved for, but when they actually try to go through the process, 80% of them get rejected and now by the data being in one place, it actually accelerates us delivering the benefits and that\u2019s where the real synergy comes into places where we can do things together that we couldn\u2019t do apart. In terms of ASP, maybe let me let Ken just talk about the business model and how it works because that will be really the key characteristics moving forward. Ken Lin : Yes, first, maybe let me frame the problem in the industry. So banks spend tens of billions of dollars each and every year marketing their financial services products and the challenge in the space is that each of those banks have a specific credit profile that they are looking for along with an ability to pay around income. Now imagine a bank that spends $100 million a year in marketing, maybe only 20% of those dollars are efficient because the other 80% go to people who are simply not qualified for that particular product. What we are able to do and speaking to this note around financial identity, we are able to help banks find those exactly right customers and I think that\u2019s the problem that we solve for our financial services partners. For the consumer, what they see is a landscape full of teaser rates, i.e., rates that are for extremely well qualified buyers. You actually can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re an extremely well qualified buyer because the banks use hundreds of different variables to determine your eligibility and what we\u2019re able to do is solve that particular problem for the consumer. So for our banking partners, they have access to a large scale of users that are highly qualified, for our members, we\u2019re able to provide a service that gives them certainty and transparency of all the offers in the market and as a business model, what we do is we charge a success fee for when we\u2019re able to match a consumer with the right financial services product and that is our business model and looking to capture all of those dollars that are being spent in digital and offline marketing today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Josh Beck : Thank you for taking the question. One of the things that the release stood out to me in the Credit Karma deck was the engagement and four times per month I think is quite strong. I imagine TurboTax has good engagement, but it tends to be more seasonal. So maybe you could just talk a little bit about how you\u2019ve gotten to those levels if it\u2019s expanding verticals or finding more relevant offers and then the second part of my question is really tied to the competitive set with Credit Karma. When I think about some of the longer-term items that Sasan mentioned, I\u2019m just wondering, is it changing in that you\u2019re competing maybe with a different audience than you used to. So would love to get some color on that? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, great. Thank you for your question. Let me kick it off and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Ken to talk about all the incredible work they have done that drives all the engagement and then some of the new verticals that Ken described we\u2019re going into. I think to your first part of your question, from a strategic perspective, in context of going after the pain point of making ends meet, this really for the consumer front for the most part shifts us from engaging very infrequently and maybe once or twice a year to now engaging customers year round and delivering significant benefit and as we talked about earlier, you got 106 million members, 37 million that are monthly active and those that are monthly active, they engage four times a year and the excitement that we have around benefits that we can deliver and what\u2019s possible in the long-term is the more offerings that we can provide truly becoming this financial assisted in the pocket of our customers where they can get access to credit cards at the best rates that are right for them, personal loans, home loans, auto loans, insurance whether it\u2019s renters insurance or home insurance, savings accounts, early access to their paychecks that drives real benefit, real engagement and higher engagement over time, but what\u2019s remarkable about the company, Ken and the team have created is it\u2019s just at massive scale already. Now with that said, maybe Ken you can jump into engagement drivers? Ken Lin : Yes, absolutely. So I think when we first started, people really questioned how engaging was the credit score and I think the reality is credit scores are something that take years to build and for many consumers, it is the hallmark of their financial health. So as a result, people tend to be very engaged in. So, your credit score changes on average once per month. We continue to add new products like credit monitoring, ID protection, Direct Dispute, which is a product that actually helps you to remove erroneous trade lines and debts from your credit report, the launch of our high yield savings product, all of these are product features that are created to help drive engagement, because we know consumers one, care about it, but two it\u2019s an important aspect of our business model and a key business driver. Josh Beck : Thanks. Congrats on the combination. Ken Lin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Congratulations all. And Ken, if I could start off asking just the very last line of the pitch deck with regard to Credit Karma background, consumers on average use 1.1 financial products a year, please define what that is, how you use that as a driver of the business, what you have done to improve it and what benefits you think might you gain now as part of the combination? Ken Lin : Yes. One of the neat aspects of our business is we can actually see how many trade lines are originated each and every year and what we find is that on average, it is 1.1 new trade lines and what that means is on average, a typical consumer will take out 1.1 new credit card, new auto loan, auto refinance, a mortgage, a store credit card. So anything that it shows and appears on your trade line, are on your credit report. We get to see that and we know that, that average is 1.1. Now specific to the business itself, what is really great is that it is highly predictable. So, we are going on our 12th year of operation. So, we have cohorts that go back 12 years and what we can see is that over time that consumers as they go through their lifecycle, their own life journey, they are able to sort of follow this pattern and we know that those credit originations are always in the market and we have an ability to both track our progress against it, but also anticipate what products consumers will need based on that rich data history that we have. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. I appreciate that. And then just shifting gears a little bit, Michelle, I guess I\u2019ll bring you in here. It was strong EPS outperformance relative to your guide in the second quarter and then it looks like the third quarter guide is a little light. I saw the 300 basis points of operating margin expansion year-over-year in Small Business and Self-Employed, just curious if there is a pull forward, what\u2019s driving the delta between the two quarters and just kind of some of the intricacies of this quarter and next? Thanks. Michelle Clatterbuck : Hey, Scott. Thanks. First of all, I would say, when we really look at our expenses and our operating margin, we don\u2019t get overly focused on quarter-by-quarter. So, we are really managing it, number one, on an annual basis and we\u2019re also managing it \u2013 so that\u2019s why, if you start to look at it quarter-by-quarter, you start to look at segment-by-segment, you might get a little wrapped up in some numbers that aren\u2019t going to be as helpful to you. So we are focusing on total year at the company level. Yes, we did come in with operating expenses a little lower in Q2 and some of that is really being driven by different investment decisions we are making and also driven by some staffing and staffing cost and so forth that came in a little lighter in Q2, but we are not changing our full year operating income guidance. And so I wouldn\u2019t get too focused on the individual quarters. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Merwin : Thanks very much for taking my question. In terms of the current members of Credit Karma obviously I saw the number is $106 million, it\u2019s a huge number. And just thinking in terms of overlap with TurboTax, can you talk about what that might look like in any way that you can through integrations or anything kind of in the workforce, people go through those apps that they could \u2013 there is a cross-sell opportunity to either platform? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, it\u2019s not something at this point that we even know what the overlap is and one that we can communicate. All we can tell you is when we look at what\u2019s possible based on the benefits that we can deliver for customers, there is a lot of upside and we are excited about the opportunity, but it\u2019s not something at this point that we even have the data to share with you. Chris Merwin : Got it. And just a quick follow-up on marketing, I know last quarter you talked about a pull forward on marketing spend to reach some of the early filers for TurboTax and looking at the consumer revenue growth rate, I think it was up 8% in the quarter, that\u2019s just below the full year guidance. So can you talk about some of the moving pieces in the quarter for consumer and your confidence level on I guess it represents an acceleration there into 3Q? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, sure. Well, first of all, I am confident in our strategy. I am confident in our execution and what we are seeing and as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re growing the category, we\u2019re taking share and knock on wood, our teams have done an incredible job with the experiences that we\u2019re delivering for customers. So that\u2019s bucket one. Bucket two is very similar to what you heard from, Michelle there is only a few days of e-file revenue in that number. So actually, our marketing dollar spend and our revenue are not really correlated. It\u2019s really the number of days of open e-file and you will see our full year results after we get through after we get through the next season. We are seeing better traction than even last year when it comes to raising awareness, consideration and just a return that we are getting on our marketing dollars. So again things are in line with what we would have expected internally and we have high expectations. Chris Merwin : Thanks very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Jester of Citi. Your line is open. Daniel Jester : Yes, great. Thank you for taking my question. Just going back to Credit Karma, obviously it affects one of your five big bets, but how should we think about how you are prioritizing kind of incremental investments in the other four big bets over the next year or two while you are focused on closing this transaction and integration? And I guess I am getting at is should we view this as kind of one really big bet and four medium-sized bets over the next year or two? And then I guess secondly, does this acquisition preclude you from doing anything kind of smaller or bolt-on in the rest of the business from an acquisition perspective? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, great. Thank you for the question. So first of all when we declared these five big bets and as we shared at Investor Day, they are grounded in fairly large customer problems that are very durable and areas where we believe that it\u2019s our obligation and our right to solve these customer problems and it\u2019s very durable and it also will result in the largest growth drivers for the company. In a couple of the bets, our gaps are probably larger than the other bets. First of all, they are all created equal, the five big bets, but we have deliberately stack ranked them the way we have, because we believe that if we had to make trade-off choices that we could be crystal clear how we would make trade-off choices. We have stacked all five bets to win internally. We made some significant investment in capital reallocations in the last year and we continue to do so to ensure that these big bets are resourced to win and with that as context, it actually doesn\u2019t change our M&A principles. I wouldn\u2019t conclude that we now have four large acquisitions coming because we have four other big bets. This is really about following our acquisition or our M&A principles around one of the largest customer problems and what are the gaps that we have and are there opportunities for us to be able to close that gap and increase speed to market and it just so happened that this bet, because really it\u2019s about serving consumers and helping them make ends meet that this just from our perspective is a great opportunity to bring two companies together to achieve greatness for our end customers. So that\u2019s the way I would think about it. Our M&A principles have not changed. Every bet is resourced to win, this was one of them where we felt like there is an opportunity to increase and improve speed the market. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Pfau : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to switch back to tax and specifically on some of the changes around the Free File Alliance agreement related to marketing, just curious if you are seeing any impact from that, whether it would be from traffic to your paid side or free-to-pay conversion or attach on of additional products like Audit Defense anything there? Sasan Goodarzi : Just as context and a reminder, the Free File program is a philanthropic effort and we abide by the Memorandum of Understanding along with other industry players, which might have reaffirmed when the report was published I think in the fall and with that as context, we don\u2019t see anything outside of the norm, based on the way the season is playing out this year in FFA. Matt Pfau : Okay. Thanks guys. Sasan Goodarzi : You are very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Turrin : Hey, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Looking at some of the available information here, it looks like the Credit Karma revenue base has been slowing over the past couple of years. It sounds like some of what Sasan and Ken have already mentioned here around data and financial partners can help stabilize that trajectory, but maybe it would be useful to hear more from Ken\u2019s perspective around how this combination of Credit Karma and the Intuit ecosystem can help stabilize and maybe even improve that trajectory going forward? Thank you. Ken Lin : Sure. So if you really look at you know the history of Credit Karma, what we have been focused on, I often think about the first 12 years of our history as really helping consumers save money when they borrow, i.e., investing in our credit cards vertical, in our mortgage vertical, in our auto lending vertical. As we continue to grow, we have now focused on the other side of the balance sheet, i.e., high yield savings and other asset plays and what\u2019s key for our platform goes back to this note around engagement and the way that we think about accelerating revenue and what our models show is that the more engagement we have, there is a direct correlation to our revenue and where the opportunities come in is that a lot of the financial identity components that the combination of Credit Karma and Intuit have together, those are big growth drivers of engagement and we believe that over time that will both drive the SDUs or sort of the engagement numbers that we track, which leads to monetization and our ability to move into other verticals outside of traditional credit cards and personal loans. Those are sort of key growth drivers that we see in the business. Michael Turrin : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jackson Ader : Great. Thanks. Hey guys. This is Jackson Ader on Sterling tonight. Just a quick follow-up on that last answer you gave, Ken, should we be thinking maybe about the growth forward coming more from having the monthly active members increase as a percent of the total number of members or will it be that total membership growth and the monthly active members should grow about in line with that? Ken Lin : I don\u2019t have an exact breakout but we know that both are both extremely important aspects of our business. One of the nice key points of our business is any given quarter, approximately 90% of our revenues are repeating users or members that registered from prior quarters i.e., 10% are from new users. So we see a combination. Our ability to drive new users drives revenue and our ability to drive existing users back drive revenue, so both are really important and fundamental to the business model and the key metrics that we track. Sasan Goodarzi : And if I could just add one thing, this is just from a go forward perspective, I think what\u2019s very just remarkable with respect to the company that Ken has built is when you have 106 million customers or members that use you, trust you, and you ultimately give the customer the ability to be able to leverage their data to be able to benefit from more and more choice, the opportunity that we have over time and again, Ken started the company with credit cards, personal loans, and now auto and home, but auto and home loans and insurance is actually kind of just at the beginning of what\u2019s possible. Then, there is this new vertical that\u2019s around savings, getting early access to your paycheck over time. So what I want you all to imagine is this truly being a consumer finance platform where it serves as a financial assistant in the pocket of consumers and the more we can deliver more benefits, the more engagement we drive over time and the more we can actually help financial services industry members be efficient and then therefore drive up ARPU and revenue and so this is just there\u2019s kind of many years of opportunity to capture the TAM that we described earlier. Ken Lin : Yes. One final note is that a lot of that data is highly scalable. So the data that is used to determine your eligibility for credit card to a personal loan to a mortgage tends to be the same. So as we move into new verticals, your cost basis is relatively fixed, but you get a bunch of scale out of those operating cost basis. So as you\u2019re moving into new verticals, you often times get to expand your margins. Jackson Ader : Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Just a quick follow-up. So the last couple of years maybe, has that monthly active member number \u2013 has that grown in line with revenue, maybe below the revenue growth rate or even above? Ken Lin : Yes. Historically, our engagement numbers have grown slightly faster than revenue and what we tend to find is our ability to launch new products like ID protection, Direct Dispute and the ones I mentioned before, high yield savings. We know that these directly correlate to the overall engagement of our user base, which is why we are so focused on driving an excellent customer experience, because we know those two things are highly correlated. Jackson Ader : Okay, thank you. Ken Lin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hey, Sasan, you talked about engagement maybe throughout the year with the TurboTax customers now that you have the Credit Karma platform or will have the Credit Karma platform. So I am wondering, will you change the branding or how will the branding work so that customers know that Credit Karma is part of the Intuit family? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, what we will do is when we, just like today, when we raise awareness and if it\u2019s TurboTax or if it\u2019s QuickBooks, you see Intuit, you see QuickBooks by Intuit or TurboTax by Intuit. So over time, we\u2019ll work with Ken and make sure that over time people know that Credit Karma is part of Intuit. What we won\u2019t do is change the brand of Credit Karma. It\u2019s established an incredible brand, it stands for choice and benefits for consumers and that is something that we wouldn\u2019t change because it has got a strong brand like QuickBooks or TurboTax has. Kartik Mehta : And then you mentioned one of the opportunities is to leverage some of the information now that customers have with their tax returns and I\u2019m wondering what type of success you have or what percentage of customers are allowing you to use their financial information from a tax return so that you can assist them in other areas? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, if you recall, one of the things we shared at Investor Day, so it\u2019s a high number. At Investor Day, we shared that we have 37 million registered users that have actually agreed for their data to be used for benefits for them and then we have 4 million active users. So, consumers are very much willing to consent for their data to be used for their benefit as long as they are in control of it and so we\u2019ve actually seen very nice traction since we\u2019ve launched Turbo. Kartik Mehta : And then just one last question, Michelle, if you look \u2013 I know you don\u2019t want to give out financial information on Credit Karma other than maybe revenue, but if you look at the revenue profile, the margin profile of Credit Karma, is it at, above or below kind of corporate averages for Intuit? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hey Kartik, you are right we are actually not in a position to give out any of the profitability information for Credit Karma. However, we do believe they are a platform and they have been driving some great engagement and scale and so we think that that\u2019s a great thing, but yes, we aren\u2019t actually able to share any of that information. Thank you, though. Kartik Mehta : No worries. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, I am showing \u2013 we have reached our time for questions, would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, please. So first of all, thank you very much for all the questions and everybody\u2019s time today. I am truly excited for the progress that we are making, the acceleration that we have ahead with Credit Karma and I would just like to close by thanking our employees. Last week, we were named the number 11 in Fortune\u2019s Top 100 Companies to Work For in the U.S. and this is our second-highest ranking in the 19 years that we have been on this list and our employees\u2019 passion and commitment to really deliver for our customers and power their prosperity and to contribute in the communities that we serve really is what fuels our impact. So, it\u2019s an absolute honor to work alongside each and every one of our employees. And again, I want to thank everyone for joining and we look forward to speaking with you at the next earnings call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Latif and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions].  With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. I am here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.  Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I will turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'm going to cover four topics on today's call to help you understand our performance in the quarter, and our outlook longer term in context of the global COVID-19 pandemic. I'll start by sharing how we've responded to the pandemic with our employees, customers, share our results for the quarter and highlight recent trends in our business. Then I'll put these results in context of our long-term strategy and finish by talking about our playbook for leading in a downturn to accelerate our performance. Let's start with our response to the pandemic where unprecedented uncertainty, along with widespread shelter-in-place initiatives have changed our daily lives. At the onset of the pandemic, we created an enterprise crisis team to drive four work streams. First, keeping our employees safe and healthy. This has been and will continue to be our number one priority. Second, ensuring that we run the business effectively and continue to deliver for our customers. Third, keeping our workforce engaged and productive. And fourth, supporting our customers, our partners, and the communities where we live and operate. I'm proud of how our employees adapted to this sudden change and how seamlessly we transitioned our 10,000 person workforce around the world to a work-from-home environment. I'm even more proud of how in the face of uncertainty, our employees\u2019 commitment to customers has grown even stronger.  The challenges facing consumers and small businesses during this difficult time have inspired our teams to innovate with speed and apply platform capabilities to help to solve several problems caused by this pandemic. As a result, let me share three examples of how we're helping consumers and small businesses get access to aid and relief.  First, in less than a week following the IRS announcement, we introduced three free stimulus registration tools in partnership with the IRS. These offerings helped more than 10 million Americans not required to file a tax return to easily register with the IRS to get their stimulus money. We're proud to donate our time and expertise to help the IRS quickly disburse billions of dollars in stimulus payments to Americans. Second, we launched Intuit Aid Assist to simplify the process of quickly connecting small businesses to the right relief funding programs based on eligibility. Intuit Aid Assist uses artificial intelligence to distill the complexity of hundreds of pages of the CARES Act and convert it into an easy-to-understand user experience delivering a personalized and actionable recommendation. This new tool is based on the same knowledge engineering, which is used by TurboTax to simplify the tax code. Third, as of May 20th, Intuit helped make available over $875 million of improved small business loans to customers from the Paycheck Protection Program or PPP to QuickBooks Capital.  The team rapidly developed the solution to simplify and automate the PPP loan application process to help to very small businesses access this program. We've helped approximately 25,000 small businesses access loans with an average loan of approximately $35,000, keeping up to approximately 150,000 employees on the payroll. These offerings are a testament to our unique platform and technology capabilities, and we will continue to find new, innovative ways to help our customers during this time of need. Now, turning to the fiscal third quarter results. Through the first part of the third quarter, we saw a continuation of great momentum we built during the first half of the year, when revenue grew 14%. At the same time, the impact of the pandemic on taxpayers and small businesses is real. The extension of the IRS tax filing deadline and local shelter-in-place directive negatively impacted performance beginning in mid-March. As a result, our total revenue declined 8% in the quarter. Let me go into more detail with how the quarter played out, starting with our Consumer Group. The extension of the IRS tax filing deadline from April 15th to July 15th has shifted the timing of millions of tax filings to later in the season, resulting in 15% decline in Consumer Group revenue during the fiscal third quarter. Based on the latest IRS data, total returns are down 9.4%, reflecting the later July 15 tax filing deadline. The do it yourself software category is performing notably better than assisted and as the category leader we're driving category awareness and growth. So we are encouraged by this result. Through May 8, IRS data shows total e-file returns are down 9.6% with self prepared e-files up 2.2% and assisted e-files down 18.8%. Because this data includes stimulus filings for individuals not usually required to file a tax return, it is not comparable to prior year data.  As of May 8th our data also indicates a majority of expected April higher value customers with the most complex returns and those with balance due have yet the file. Therefore, we're proud of our progress so far and feel good about where we stand with the TurboTax online share and ARPC keeping us on track during the last two months of the season. Our strategy is working. We're accelerating our innovation and are well positioned for the remainder of the season.  We're making progress on serving fast-growing under-penetrated segments including Latinx, self-employed and customers with investments. We are focused on increasing customer confidence through access to experts with TurboTax Live and we're seeing a positive impact on both conversion and retention when these customers interact with an expert. The extension of the season has also given us the opportunity to run additional experiments to improve the experience, product lineup and pricing for the future. Let me turn to small business. We began to see an impact from COVID-19 on our business in mid-March as many small businesses began closing or significantly scaling back their operations, leading to loss of income and rising unemployment. Despite these headwinds, Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 11% an Online Ecosystem revenue grew 28%.  Let me share some of the recent trends in our business. During the second half of the quarter QuickBooks online new customer acquisition decelerated approximately 15 points versus the first half and retention within the existing customer base decreased by 2 points versus a year ago. We continue to expect the Small Business customer base and ARPC to grow in fiscal year 2020. The services offerings within QuickBooks Online have experienced an even greater impact. For example, after growing approximately 30% year-over-year through mid-March, payment charge volume was flat year-over-year during the second half of the quarter. Within our online payroll offering after an increase of 20% year-over-year and workers paid through mid-March, workers paid decreased 10% year-over-year during the second half of the quarter. Similarly, after the total number of companies running payroll grew 15% year-over-year through mid-March, the number of companies running payroll was approximately flat during the second half of the quarter. These trends could result in higher attrition and lower revenue in the future.  Despite limited visibility in near term, we are more inspired than ever to achieve our 2025 prosperity, reputation and growth goals. As a reminder, our prosperity goals are at a double household savings rate and improve the success rate of small businesses by 10 points better than benchmark for anyone on our platform. We will do so by becoming an AI-driven expert platform and doubling down on our five big bets. As we look into the future, we have resourced our big bets for acceleration. Let me share our progress on each of these bets.  Big bet number one is foundational to accelerate innovation across our platform. I'll come back to this one in a minute since it supports the other four big bets. Big bet number two is all about connecting people to experts. One of the largest problems our customers face is lack of confidence to do their own taxes and to manage our business. We're connecting customers to experts on our platform to solve this problem with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, allowing us to reach more customers, deepen engagement and grow ARPC. Within TurboTax Live this season, we've improved access to experts through real time chat and a floating live help button, contributing to improving customer conversion and retention.  On the expert side of the platform, we're using AI to improve the experience by automating repetitive tasks, and presenting experts with a contextual customer information, based on the location of the customer within the product experience. As a result, we've seen average session handle time decline nearly 20% this season, while at the same time providing a better experience for our customers. This season, we've earned the highest customer satisfaction scores for TurboTax Live ever. For QuickBooks Live, we're seeing promising early results. With the rapid shift to virtual solutions, we're seeing better-than-expected customer acquisition and we continue to experiment across the line-up. For example, we further refined the Set Up offering we introduced in January. We're seeing an encouraging number of customers who have used the Set Up offering to upgrade their monthly subscription, making us optimistic that's it\u2019s a great way to introduce customers to the benefits of QuickBooks Live. Our third big bet is to unlock smart money decisions for customers by connecting them to financial tools and partners that help put more money in their pockets. In its third season, we're on track to nearly double active use for Turbo. This suggests customers are finding value from our recently introduced innovations like mobile refund tracking and weekly credit card -- credit score updates. And in this challenging environment, our pending acquisition of Credit Karma is more important than ever because we help consumers make better financial decisions. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers sell in an omni-channel world, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence. We recently launched Cash Flow Planner in QuickBooks Online. Managing cash flow is the biggest problem our customers face, one that is only magnified during this difficult period. Cash Flow Planner is an AI-powered interactive tool that looks at small businesses\u2019 financial history to predict future money in and money out events, enabling a small business customer to forecast its cash needs more accurately. Within payments, we're offering our payments customers free access to instant deposits to put more money in their hands even faster. Since this free offer became available, the volume of payments received instantly by our customers has more than doubled. This offering is in its early days. Within payroll, we're enabling our small business customers to hold on to their money longer by using our money movement capabilities to pay employees next day. As a result, we've reduced the time between running payroll and paying employees by one-third, driving product recommendation scores up 10%. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the mid market with QuickBooks Online event, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. We developed this offering to help us increase retention of larger customers and attract new mid market customers, who are over-served by higher priced competitive offerings. We introduced several new features to help our customers individually tailor the product to their needs, including building their own dashboard and additional custom fields for expense transactions. We continue to work closely with partners to develop integrations that save our customers\u2019 time and improve their experience. Now more than ever, a cloud offering is needed by mid-market customers at a disruptive price.  Now let me wrap up our big bets by circling back to bet number one, which is our foundational bet to revolutionize speed to benefit for our customers. Our goal is to deliver benefits to our customers instantly and to make the interactions with our offerings frictionless by accelerating the application of AI. Earlier, I shared several examples of how we're using AI to provide customers access to help through Intuit Aid Assist and PPP funds through QuickBooks Capital or how our customers are accessing funds with instant deposit, managing cash flow with Cash Flow Planner or how we're improving the experience for experts with AI. We are uniquely positioned to use AI to unlock the power of data and service to our customers, both the velocity and impact of our innovation. Now, let me share our thoughts on the bigger picture in the current environment. We expect this environment to act as an accelerant to the best we've declared. First, we expect to see an accelerating shift to our virtual world. This aligns with our big bet to connect people to experts using technology to improve competence. Second, the need for small businesses to increase their online presence and commerce will become more essential, and this aligns with our big bet to be the center of small business growth by providing tools and visibility for customers to better manage their cash flow.  Finally, as we've seen in previous times of hardship, we expect consumers to put a high premium on offerings that can improve their financial health, which aligns with our bets to help consumers unlock smart money decisions. This includes helping our customers with saving more money and getting out of debt and becoming a trusted financial assistant in their pocket with our pending acquisition of Credit Karma. Our strategy in big bets position us better than ever before. We have a proven playbook that focuses our investments on accelerated innovation and what matters most. In that context, we have aligned the company to invest in what's most important for future growth, while delivering against our financial principles. We intend to play offense during this downturn by investing in the largest opportunities for the future, our big bets. When we do our job well, we believe we will come out of this downturn stronger than ever before. To wrap up, I'm incredibly proud of our accomplishments this quarter. We remain focused on what matters most to our customers and those things that we can control during this time of uncertainty. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by adding my thoughts on the playbook we're using to run the business during these challenging economic times and then provide an overview of our financial results this quarter. As Sasan shared, we've been through tough economic times before and have developed a playbook of principles for operating in a downturn. These principles are designed to accelerate our execution in the future and help both our customers and Intuit emerge from a downturn in a stronger position than when it began. One of those principles is focusing on controlling what we can, including discretionary spending to deliver bottom-line results, roughly three quarters of Intuit\u2019s expense base is variable over time. We're scrutinizing all expenses and carefully managing what we can control in this environment, such as travel, marketing spend, and hiring decisions.  Let me now turn to our results. As Sasan mentioned, we saw a continuation of the strong momentum we built through the second quarter, during the first half of the third quarter, followed by a slowdown in our business beginning in mid-March. For the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we delivered revenue of $3 billion, down 8% year-over-year; GAAP operating income of $1.4 billion, a 21% decrease; non-GAAP operating income of $1.5 billion an 18% decrease; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.11, a 21% decrease; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.49, a 19% decrease.  Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue was $1.8 billion down 15% in the third quarter. This decline reflects the delay of the IRS tax filing deadline to July 15th which is shifting revenue out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter.  We're pleased with what we've seen season to-date and do-it-yourself category continues to grow faster than assisted and we feel good about where we stand with TurboTax Online\u2019s share. With two months still to go in the season it's difficult to know if these trends will continue or whether more consumers will choose to file an extension. Either way, we expect the DIY category to gain share again this season as it has for more than a decade. And in the Strategic Partner Group, professional tax revenues declined 18% in the third quarter reflecting the impact of the delayed tax filing deadlines on the timing of consumer tax filings completed by accountants.  We grew Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue 11% during the third quarter, driven by Online Ecosystem revenue growth of 28%. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally.  Starting with grow the core, QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 36% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and to a lesser extent, mix shift. During the second half of the quarter, we saw the pace of new customer acquisition and retention both decline, especially among lower ARPC customers. Keep in mind that there is a lagging impact to QuickBooks Online accounting revenue, although we do expect both our subscriber base and ARPC to grow during fiscal year 2020.  Second we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue which includes payroll, payments, time tracking, and capital, grew 16% in fiscal Q3. Within payroll we continued to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full service offerings. Roughly two-thirds of online payroll revenue is generated from monthly subscription fees and one-third is generated from per employee monthly fees. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth along with an increase in charge volume for customers. During the second half of the quarter charge volume decelerated. Fewer workers were paid and fewer companies ran payroll. These leading indicators could result in higher attrition and lower revenue for these offerings in the future. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q3. Total international online revenue, again, grew over 50% reflecting subscriber and ARPC growth earlier in the fiscal year. However, this momentum has slowed and could resolve in decelerating revenue growth in the future. Desktop Ecosystem revenue declined to 6% in the third quarter. Desktop units declined sharply, reflecting lower sales through the retail and direct channels beginning in mid-March. This was offset by mid single-digit QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue growth.  Within our desktop payroll offering nearly 10% fewer workers were paid during the second half of the quarter versus a year ago. This compares to growth in the mid single-digits during the first half of the quarter through mid-March. Desktop payments charge volume growth declined just over 20% in the second half of the quarter. As we shared, Intuit is helping small businesses to obtain loans from the Paycheck Protection Program through QuickBooks Capital. We're working in partnership with an SBA approved bank and we're also directly funding a portion of these loans. We don't expect to hold these loans on our balance sheet and revenue from these loans was immaterial during the quarter. Let me turn to our pending acquisition of Credit Karma. We expect the acquisition to be accretive over time. But given the current environment, we don't have visibility into whether it will be neutral to accretive in the first full fiscal year after closing. We continue to expect the transaction to close during the second half of calendar year 2020, and we're excited about the unprecedented benefits we can deliver together for customers. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investments greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities as a company, with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment, although we recognize that we may not be able to achieve them in the current environment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. On May 7th, we drew down the full amount of our $1 billion revolving credit facility to maintain financial flexibility. We repurchased $40 million of stock in the third quarter, but have temporarily suspended share purchases in conjunction with the Credit Karma acquisition, as is typical during a stock transaction. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market in the future.  The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share payable July 20, 2020. This represents a 13% increase versus last year. We will not be providing guidance today. As a reminder, we withdrew our fiscal 2020 guidance earlier this month, reflecting uncertainty in current small business trends. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thanks, Michelle. We are uniquely positioned to make a positive impact on the world during this time. I'm proud of the actions that we've taken as a company to support our customers when they need us most. We've acted with speed, enabled our employees to be safe and productive working from home and continuing to innovate for our customers. We're using our capabilities to rapidly deploy solutions to help consumers and small businesses access the products and relief that they need during this fiscal time. I'm confident we will emerge an even stronger company.  So, with that, let me turn it over to you Latif. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Sasan maybe just to start with you. When you think about sort of this environment and what you all have to do to sort of help your client base out, is there anything you've done differently I guess in terms of either invoicing duration or obviously discounting? I guess, just how do you think about sort of, in balance, really the short-term versus the long-term? Obviously, you mentioned that the shift towards virtual is clearly going to happen faster and I think nobody would argue with you about that. But can you just talk about sort of how you're talking or thinking about your I guess pricing when it gets down to it and invoicing with your clients in this very difficult environment for a lot of them? Sasan Goodarzi : Let me take it in maybe two ways. One, maybe mid longer term and then the other is the here and now. First of all, we have a playbook for times like this and our playbook is really about focusing on customers, focusing on innovation and putting our investment dollars in the areas that matter the most. But then, as you heard from Michelle, being very diligent in terms of our expense, envelope. With that said, as we look at the long-term, we're actually quite excited about the current environment, not the health element of it, but the fact that it will accelerate folks moving to a virtual world, folks moving to having more online presence and commerce capabilities and then money has always been important. But we believe more than ever, ways to save money and get out of debt is going to be more important than ever before and our big bets are squarely focused on the things that matter the most. And we happen by the way to be going through our one and two year planning process, which literally was happening in parallel of when the pandemic started. And it was at that time where we actually used the opportunity not only to be clear about a conservative investment envelope for our next fiscal year, but to really ensure that we can take the dollars that we have allocated and use them as an accelerant for our bets and we just finalized our one and three year plan internally and have allocated our dollars to the big bets and the ones that matter most, and in fact, again, using it as an opportunity to accelerate. So, we actually feel good about the things that we can control and the things that we need to do for our customers to come out of this even stronger. With that said, and going to the very today here and now elements of your questions, part of our playbook is ensure that we really bend over backwards and do what's right for customers in this kind of an environment and beyond the innovations that you heard that we kind of turned on a dime to deliver like instant deposit for free, PPP, the free stimulus offerings that we referenced, brought to the marketplace. There are elements of things that we're doing for our customers such as we paused any price increases that we planned. We paused our full service payroll migration, which has significant benefits for customers and those that migrate to it at rave, but we didn't want to have our customers think about payroll migration in a time like this.  As we've communicated in the past, we have in essence launched in you line up in QuickBooks, one element of it being QuickBooks Advanced, which allows us to serve mid-market customers. That comes with very clear lines of number of users, number of invoices that you can pay, the number of transactions. And for now, we've actually paused that important line, where you have to migrate to QuickBooks Advanced, all of which at the right time we will put back in place. But we're being very diligent to do what's right for customers, and we're getting a lot of great feedback from customers, inclusive of some of the discounting that we put in place to acquire new customers in these very uncertain times. So those are just some of the examples of the things that we're doing. We have a proven playbook where really the team is actually getting quite well against it. Kirk Materne : And if I can ask just a really quick follow-up. I assume given what's going on has really no impact on serve your initial thought process around sort of the integration plan for Credit Karma. Is that correct? Sasan Goodarzi : It does not. We're actually more excited about what we can do with Credit Karma to accelerate helping customers, save money and reduce debt. So, it has not changed our plans. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Mark Rende : Hi. Mark Randy on for Keith Weiss here. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I want to dig in a little bit to the TurboTax side. So, obviously a big shift in revenues related to the filing extension. But have you guys seen any change in the mix of free files? Was that any reason for the kind of push of revenues? Any detail on the free filing that would be helpful. Sasan Goodarzi : So, Mark, thanks for your question. First of all, I'll just remind us that, when you look at the categories that we serve, the DIY category is about $3 billion in TAM. The assisted category is about $20 billion in TAM. And then the consumer finance space, which we're going to be able to accelerate serving with Credit Karma is about $57 billion in TAM. In that context, very specifically to your question, this is actually the part of the season that is our strength. Really the revenue that shifted into the fourth quarter is because of the fact that the IRS deadline shifted, and these are actually the more high value customers, the more complex customers and the ones that have balance due, and it's actually are our strength. This part of the season is our strength, because it's our customers with the highest retention over the years. And so, given where we are with the category growth and given that we're the champions of do-it-yourself category with the category growth and what we see with share and ARPC, we feel good about where we are and we're excited about playing our game in the last two months of the season which is our strength. And we've really not seen anything outside of what we would expected from an FSA perspective. So, really the revenue shift is entirely because of the shift in the deadline. Mark Rende : Excellent. Really helpful. If I could sneak in one quick follow up. So, there's obviously been a big uptake in share gains this season in DIY. How do you expect that? Do you expect it to normalize until the back half of the season as like shelter-in-place kind of restrictions come off and ease and people can go to a tax professional or a CPA or you see this being relatively durable throughout the rest of the season? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, I'll make two comments. One is, I think this pandemic will drive structural and behavior changes across many industries, whether it's education, whether how you get mortgage loans, to how you manage your business, to how you do your taxes. And the great news is we're positioned the well with our digital platform to serve customers with assistance to really take advantage of the opportunity. And there's just simply a tailwind of more and more folks wanting to be able to do their taxes themselves and if they need help to be able to get that assistance in the comfort of their home. We'll have to see how the season plays out. I don't want to second guess whether these current trends will continue or not. But what I would tell you is that the shift to a virtual world probably accelerated by five years across many, many different industries. And I think that will be the same thing that we'll see play out when it comes to doing your taxes and/or helping small businesses manage their books, which is where QuickBooks Live comes into play. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Many companies have been giving us a little bit of color into the current month on -- and I'm curious if there's any color about what you're seeing from the perspective of April turning into May, any notable items would be helpful? Sasan Goodarzi : So, what I would say is -- Id just touch on the first couple of weeks in May. We have seen a stabilization. To be specific we've seen stabilization in charge volume, the number of payroll companies that are paying their employees. We've seen stabilization and the number of companies that are tracking their time through TSheets. We've been seeing the same thing with acquisition of new customers and we've seen stabilization on the retention front. And on desktop, we've seen a little bit of an uptick because we deliberately slowed down the communication upgrades to our desktop customers, because the timing of doing so was really right in line with when the pandemic hit. And so now that we've started that communication, there's been a little bit of an uptick. I think what\u2019s really important, if I put all of this in a context, is it\u2019s several weeks of trends. And we want to make sure that we don't portray several weeks of trends into a trend, but we have seen a stabilization in the first two weeks, but we clearly want to see the economy come back and ultimately see small businesses open up and see if that trend continues. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Simmons with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Robert Simmons : So, can you talk about how you've adjusted with the amounts and the timing of your advertising spending and the overall -- across the different segments given the tax season is more spread out this year and other factors? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure, Robert. Thank you for your question. Let me make two points. One, when this pandemic hit beyond the fact that we were right in the middle of our two and one year of planning and it was a great opportunity for us to agree to a conservative investment envelope as we look ahead to really continue to build our muscle in terms of prioritization and resource allocation. We also then looked at that here and now and what changes we would make. And we did reduce discretionary funds in areas that we were very comfortable with. Of course travel is a given, but hiring and marketing across the board. And specifically in TurboTax both customer success and marketing, we of course needed to kind of lead time, which the team has done. We have a playbook around this and extended between now and July 15th. And so, we've done that. But I would say overall the company's discretionary spend are down because we lowered it for right reasons, but particularly in tax, we just simply extended it through the end of July. We expect, by the way, just sort of kind of black box that we'll need to spend up to $20 million in both customer success and marketing because of the extension of the tax season to ensure that we're there for our customers, but we've also reallocated dollars from other places in the company to make up for it. Robert Simmons : And then can you talk to how the economics of the PPP work for Intuit? Just like what kind of cut of the fees you keep and that sort of thing? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure. Maybe if I could just ask Michelle to take that. Michelle Clatterbuck : Absolutely. We haven't talked specifically about the monetization. As Sasan talked about earlier, we did say that we've provided $875 million of PPP Small Business loans, and we're working with an SBA approved bank to fund these loans. We're funding some directly, but it's a small amount and we don't expect to hold those. We will expect to earn about 3% to 4% including servicing on the loans themselves. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Tsung- Yao Chu : Hi, everyone. It's Yao Chu on for Brad Zelnick. Thank you for taking my question, and thanks for what you're doing for small businesses out there. I have a question as it relates to Intuit Capital and potentially Credit Karma. From my understanding, the business models of these segments rely on the algorithms that are basically a combination of historical behavior and real-time data. One of the criticisms of FinTech is that every crisis is driven from the next and that some of these algorithms may be built in data from the last cycle that may not be so relevant in the current one. As we work our way through this, can you share some thoughts on a couple of things. Firstly, how well these businesses and algorithms are working? And does the value proposition remain intact for these data-centric plays? And where the main gaps or differences in behavior where you may have needed to intervene? And I guess based on that, do you think managing through this crisis inherently increases the value of these assets in the longer-term playing through both the downswing and the recovery? Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you for the question, Yao, and good to hear your voice, and hope all is well. Let me make a general comment, maybe two general comments and get more specific to your question. I think that first of all, as you know, us and Credit Karma are operating as two separate companies, but what I can tell you from the due diligence that we did, we were very impressed with their machine learning capabilities, their ability to do quality checks to watch for bias, and adjust their models on a daily basis because they use 2,600-plus data points per customer to run their models and so they are always adjusting. But let me, that's in context of the due diligence that we did, and I would just say the second macro point is this is one of the reasons why we believe that this environment is actually an accelerant for us to find ways to help customers put more money in their pockets, save money, and get out of debt because all of the machine learning capabilities that we have and Credit Karma has and that we have that in this current environment, done the right way, actually allows us to adjust our models to better serve customers. Now, let me get more specific I think to your question around QuickBooks Capital. This QuickBooks Capital and the machine learning capabilities and the platform is something that we've been working on for years both cleaning up the data so we can use 26 billion data sources and the 360 information that we have from our customers and with their permission to be able to use to in essence know what loans that they can be able to take on, what capacity, the number of months, and how quickly we can adjust our dial. And one of the things that the team has done that's a wonderful progress is that we do checks for biases. Whether in this environment or in a different environment, we're always checking for biases so we can adjust the model. And the model's built in such a way where we can adjust it on a daily basis so we can learn very, very quickly, and what we see in this environment is that it's actually a great opportunity to accelerate our learning so that we can be much more pinpoint in terms of what we can do for customers and when we can do it for the customers. So I'm proud of our QuickBooks Capital team and what they've been able to actually accomplish, and we're learning and adjusting more daily. And by the way, those capabilities is not just for QuickBooks Capital. We use those same capabilities for Instant Deposit, same-day payments, we use those same capabilities for same-day payroll, and so these capabilities are truly platform capabilities that we can use across the company. Tsung-Yao Chu : And let me sneak one more quick one in. What are the main constraints in distributing PPP funds faster at this point? Sasan Goodarzi : I'm sorry. Could you ask your question one more time? Tsung-Yao Chu : Yes. I know you've distributed about -- a bunch of PPP funds to-date. Can you talk to the main constraints on the ability to distribute the funds faster to your base? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, first of all, we truly admire what the team in Treasury and SBA has done to make these loans available and all of the checks they've had to do on privacy and security to be able to distribute these loans, so they truly deserve an applause for the work that they've done. To get to your question, we actually have been able to move quite fast and quite rapidly because of the fact that we know our customers' data, whether it's QuickBooks and payroll customers or QuickBooks Desktop payroll customers, or Self-Employed that have actually filed their taxes with us and be able to very quickly help them apply for the loan. Really, the biggest inhibitor has been all of these that are applying for the loan and having to wait in line to be able to get the loans approved by the SBA. And so, really that's where the bottleneck is. And by the way, the SBA is actually moving quite fast. It's just the number of loans that's coming out of loan requests and how they have to process it and ensure that they reduce fraud. That's I think probably the most difficult part. But on our end, we've been able to move very, very rapidly and we don't really have too many obstacles in front of us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Sasan, you talked about one of the bets is in -- like selling in omni-channel world. In fact, we're seeing small businesses they're trying to have their online presence or moving to more of e-commerce environment. So could you give us some color like how Intuit can help and how big is an opportunity for Intuit for helping SMB moving to online? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, thank you for your question. Again, great to hear your voice, and hope you're safe and sound. When you think about Intuit's base, we serve primarily service base businesses, and one of the core drivers behind our bet number four which is being the center of small business growth and one element of it being really providing transformative experiences to make it easy for our customers to do commerce across multiple channels is to actually be able to accelerate serving and penetrating product-based businesses. But it's interesting what this environment is causing, so now let me get to answer your question in two ways. One is even service-based businesses, they're actually if you remember at Investor Day we shared last year that we have 400 million-plus invoices that our customers send out, but about 12% are payment-enabled. We're actually seeing more and more service-based businesses that are actually looking to make all of their payments payment-enabled so they can actually get paid online faster and be able to get out of the paper world. And so this is having, this is going to over time have an impact on service-based businesses to get out of doing manual payroll and doing it online because they've seen with the Paycheck Protection Program if you can't prove your payroll data, you're not really -- you're not going to be able to be first in line to get a loan. And so, it's going to impact more and more service-based businesses going online which is where our sweet spot is. The second element though is the question you asked which is omni-channel, and really the core problem that we want to solve based on well over a year of conversations with our customers is it's actually quite easy for our customers to get set up on different channels, whether it's Instagram, Facebook, Etsy, Amazon, that's not their biggest issue. Their biggest issue is they lose sight of which customer is coming from which channel, which customer is profitable, are they getting paid on time across the different channels, how that connects to their inventory, because clearly, you don't want to run out of inventory and fulfillment is critical. And so the problem that we want to solve is really if I put it in simple terms, having an app where you can actually see all the orders that came in through all the different channels in one place. You can ultimately over time see the profitability of your payments. It connects to the profitability of your customers. You can see how it connects to your inventory that automatically tells you that you're going to have to fulfill your inventory. We're in the very early stages of solving that problem, but we're very clear on what the problem is and we believe this environment will not only over time help us penetrate service-based businesses but it will position us bet number four, to serve product-based businesses. So that's the way we see it and that's the way we think about it. Siti Panigrahi : Yes, thanks for that color. And if I could ask one question on tax. This is unusual tax filing year, now it's shifted to July 15 from April 15, so what percent of the people have usually those file taxes if you exclude the people those who filed for stimulus check, what percentage have now not yet filed and moved to maybe for this quarter, and also, what are the changes you're seeing in terms of TurboTax Live adoption so far? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Well first of all, I'll start by affirming it is a very unusual season because I don't think we've been in a place where tax season has been extended. But in many ways, it's affording us new opportunities because our team is built for times like this and things like experimenting in ways that we otherwise wouldn't be able to. So our team is doing a wonderful job leveraging the current opportunity. If you think about last year, there was 155 million returns filed and I think there's 110-ish-million that have been filed already, and the actual specific numbers are on the IRS website, but nevertheless, that would tell you that you've got 40 million, 45 million customers that still need to file their taxes between now and July 15. So that kind of gives you a feel for what's left to come. In terms of TurboTax Live, we focused this year on improving first-time use. We're really focused on providing more access to experts because when our customers engage an expert, our conversion and retention goes up and we're really focused on improving the expert side of the platform, meaning that experts would contextually know where the customer is, and how to best serve them and help them very, very quickly. And so far, TurboTax Live is really delivering within the expectations that we have had for it, and we've got two months of the most complex filers that are still left to come, and so we're excited to serve as many customers as we can between now and then through TurboTax Live. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Ken Wong : And thanks for all the good color on the first half/second-half splits. Maybe I'll steer this question toward Michelle. So obviously lots of unknowns in kind of going forward, but as we think about your kind of ability to guide or I guess lack thereof, is this more a matter of kind of magnitude in terms if things could get worse, or just an issue of duration in terms of not understanding how long this might play out? Thank you. Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Ken. Thanks for the call -- question. First of all, I would say that as Sasan said, we are starting to see a few trends in the business that are stabilizing and he enumerated those a minute ago. But it just doesn't make sense off of two weeks of data to be able to predict going forward, so that is really the biggest issue there. But I would say don't confuse the lack of guidance with a lack of confidence in our business and our strategy. So in fact, we've never been more confident in our business, our strategy of becoming AI-driven expert platform, and the five big bets that we've declared. But confidence doesn't mean certainty, and we're in a very uncertain environment as we've discussed, and so that's actually why we're not issuing guidance. It's really around the uncertainty. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Jester of Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Another one on QuickBooks Capital, if I can? For the loans that you've made for PPP, how many of those customers were brand new and never really used the QuickBooks Capital loan program before? Maybe you can just kind of -- just in terms of repeat usage there would be interested to see if you're expanding the ability on the back-end of this to get people already in your system to use QuickBooks Capital. And then just are there any learnings either from the regulatory or the go-to-market there that could accelerate QuickBooks Capital on the back-end of this? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure. Thanks for your question, and Kim and/or Michelle will keep me honest on this. Our goal was to serve as many small businesses as we could, and of course, we started with our existing base and I believe that all of the current customers that we served are all existing QuickBooks customers. So I'll get confirmation if I got that wrong, but it's been primarily all existing customers. And I would tell you to the second part of your question, it's incredible the halo effect that we've gotten by all the things that I mentioned earlier, from very quickly partnering with the IRS to launch the stimulus offerings, to what we've done with the PPP program, to what we've done to fund and partner with Go Fund Me, which is a crowd-sourcing platform to help small businesses get access to money, which I think has been almost close to $40 million that small businesses have gotten access to. Just a number of things that we've done has gotten really a lot of attention for QuickBooks as a brand that can help customers. And I think this current environment and what we have to do very specifically around PPP just really made our machine model, machine learning models stronger which allows us to make our services stronger which allows us to really over time, helps us better serve payments, payroll, and ultimately QuickBooks Capital customers. Daniel Jester : Great. Thank you. And then on Turbo and Mint, I think you in your prepared remarks talked a bit about engagement. I'm just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color there. Does engagement mean clicks, or does it mean actually going through and purchasing a credit card or a loan through your partner? I'm just wondering if you could give some more color there. Thanks very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, yes, absolutely. So what we have seen, more demand, less supply. And so on the demand side means that customers are really interested in their credit score, they're really interested setting goals for their credit score, and learning from us how to improve their credit score by potentially making payments on time or checking on the status of their refund, and of course, more interested in them getting access to whether it's personal loans, credit cards, those sorts of things. What we've seen an impact on is on the supply side, because in this kind of an environment, although the digital platform is the highest return for financial institutions, we've seen some financial institutions pull back temporarily off of the Turbo and Mint platform. But it's also the first place qualitatively that they told us they want to come back to. They're just waiting for the current environment specifically unemployment to stabilize so that they can then come back on to the platform. So higher demand, less supply from a financial institution side, which means less monetization. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good afternoon, Sasan and Michelle. Thanks a lot. My first question is during fiscal 2009, the Global Financial Crisis, Small Business was relatively flattish. I think the revenue was down only 1%, and Sasan, I'd love to hear your thoughts, just high-level conceptually about just compare and contrast about that time versus this time, what we're seeing and what could be good case/bad case. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, sure. Well, what I would start with and to build on your point, in '08-'09 time frame, what you in essence saw was in essence, the total number of small businesses that went out of business it upticked a couple of points. The number of businesses that started downticked a couple of points. So there was kind of a 3, 4 point impact on the total number of small businesses. And the second thing I would say is things are in some ways very different than '08 and '09 on two dimensions. One is, '08 and '09 was actually a recession caused by the health of financial institutions. This is a pandemic that's health-driven where in essence, small businesses have been completely shut down. The economy was actually quite healthy, but now it's not because of the shutdown of small businesses, which has also caused a recession. So in some ways, they're very different, but in many ways, the impact that we're seeing is the same, which is customer acquisition as I mentioned earlier has slowed down, retention has down-ticked a few points, charge volume has down-ticked from being up 30 to now it's been flat post-mid-March COVID impact. And so that's the impact of course that we're seeing now, but our business is also very different. We have larger portion of our Small Business is subscription-based and it's in the cloud whereas back then, it was primarily Desktop which sees a sharper decline but also a sharper rebound. So with all of that said, those are the two or three things that from a from/to perspective are different. I would reiterate what I mentioned earlier. We are not trying to second-guess the market or meaning how fast things will rebound or how long this is going to, this impact will stay in place. So we're very focused on our controllables, which is accelerating our focus on our big bets, helping our customers in times like this just to ensure we're positioned to come out of this much, much stronger than when we even went into it. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. I appreciate that. And as a follow-up, over on the tax side, just curious what insight you have from the IRS thus far with regard to the stimulus filings? And I believe in your April 13 press release, you said you thought that would be for more than 10 million Americans, but not a very clear number. Do you have an idea what type of impact that number will be on the IRS volume results this year for tax filing? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. We of course as I mentioned earlier, the numbers -- the stimulus numbers are actually in the current filings and we believe at some point the IRS will hopefully separate them so there's visibility for our investment community, what the actual tax returns are versus stimulus returns. 80% of folks have actually been eligible for the stimulus money. The point that we tried to be clear about earlier is that there are 10 million people that don't typically have to file their taxes that are also eligible, and so they have to go through the stimulus offering to be able to get access to the funds. And we believe at some point by then the tax season, the IRS will in essence flesh that out and communicate what the actual tax returns are versus stimulus filings. What you should be left with is it doesn't change the perspective that we shared about the business. The do-it-yourself category is growing. We're seeing a larger and faster shift to the category. We feel good about where we are relative to our online share and ARPC, and this is the part of the season that's our strength and we're looking forward to finishing the next couple of months out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Michelle, you had mentioned earlier about three-quarters of the expense base is variable and it's taking some actions and been forced into some actions around travel and marketing and hiring. Can you give us a sense on what amount you're saving right now with those things? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Brad. Thanks for the question. What I would start with is I would say that we have principles around leading through a downturn and they have been proven out. One of the principles in our playbook, as I mentioned, is really around controlling what we can, discretionary spend, so that we can deliver our bottom-line results. We're looking at all of our expenses. Some of those that are easiest to control though are the travel, some marketing spend and the hiring decisions. I'm personally, along with everyone on Sasan's staff making sure that we're really thinking about what we can do in the short-term. But we're also taking a look at things that may have a longer-term impact, things like our real estate decisions and working remotely. As Sasan also mentioned a little bit ago, we will have some increases in expenses. That's for the tax season, the extended season, about $20 million that's marketing and customer success, but we have been able to offset some of that with the discretionary spend. We haven't given a specific number, but we feel very good about the actions that we've been taking in order to get our spend in-line and set ourselves up for next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Josh Beck : Thanks for the question, and congrats on all the great work you've done for your customers. Probably a higher level question for Sasan. You talked about this idea of virtual acceleration and just given your purview and that you see how businesses and consumers are behaving, I'm just wondering if there's any areas where it seems like it could be notably strong on potentially the other side of this pandemic. So any color you can give there would be great. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, sure. I'll start with what I think all of you see and then I'll make a specific to us, but as I talked a lot of my peers across many different industries whether it's CEOs of companies or investors in many, many companies across many industries, whether it's from how you used to get your workouts in and training, if you went to a trainer and how that is shifting to a virtual world, Peloton being one example of that where it's accelerating to an education world where now you have to figure out how to get your education online to more and more people now shifting to be able to engage for medical help online, so getting your taxes done, to being able to manage your business and bookkeeping, and so we believe that this pandemic will have a structural and behavioral impact in several areas. One is just you're going to first think about how to potentially engage in a virtual world, not in a physical world. It doesn't mean we won't go back to a physical world, but I think this will have a fundamental behavioral impact over time. Two is to ensure that you're doing most of your stuff online whether it's how you do payments, whether it's how you do payroll, whether it's how you conduct commerce, even if you're a service business, moving some of your things to now be able to conduct it online is going to be important. And then more important than ever, how do you ensure that you can save money and reduce debt? So we believe that structurally and behaviorally, those three areas are going to accelerate, and it's anybody's guess by how much. But literally, if you think about it overnight, these areas have shifted and I just think we've progressed five years in this area of moving to a virtual world the area of more being online, and the importance of money, and that's one of the things that excites our leadership team and the whole company around what is possible for us to accelerate to ensure that we can deliver for our customers given these shifts that we're seeing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Pfau : Thanks for fitting me in. Just wanted to ask on the QuickBooks business if you're seeing any difference in terms of behavior between U.S. customers or international customers and then Self-Employed relative to Small Businesses? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, thanks, Matt. Although our trends were all at the Small Business level, what I would just tell you is we've seen U.S. be a bit more resilient than countries outside of the U.S. and all those metrics that we shared. And then the second thing is on the Self-Employed side, what's interesting is although the macro numbers that we shared which is acquisition being down 15 points before and after, or after COVID, with some of the discounting that we are doing, we're actually seeing interest probably more than before on the Self-Employed side. That of course in no way covers the impact that we're seeing on acquisition, but we're actually seeing what we're looking to learn is are these new Self-Employed businesses being born and they're using our Self-Employed app, or maybe we're doing the analysis and looking at our data. But the bumper sticker is I would say U.S. is more resilient than countries outside the U.S., and we're seeing interesting acquisition trends on SE early days, we need to analyze it to understand where they're coming from. It doesn't change the bigger picture of what we shared, which is post-mid-March we were down 15 points and we've seen that stabilize, but SE is a little bit of a green shoot that we're looking to learn more about. Operator : Thank you. At this time, our final question for the session comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Bank of America. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : I have a couple of quick questions, and thanks for the extended time that you've spent on the conference call. Really appreciate it. One is, Sasan, what are the indicators you're looking for that Small Business activity could be starting to not just stabilize but starting to pick up some fundamental ground indicators that since you've been in the business such a long time, I'm sure that there are some things you're keenly watching for. I'm just curious what they are. And also, if you could share your thoughts, Michelle or Sasan, how to think about this year's unemployment because it's going to weigh on next year's taxes. I'm curious what are the things that Intuit can do because the story has been that you've been gaining market share every single year, but this year is an exceptionally bad year for unemployment sadly, and I'm curious, what is Intuit going to be doing differently to keep its growth profile as strong as it has been on the consumer tax side going into next year. Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, Kash. Great to hear your voice, and hope you're doing well and safe and sound. Let me start with your last question first, and you're very right. It is sad to see this kind of an unemployment rate and we are all hopeful that at some point things will rebound and folks will be able to get back to work. I think what I would say is because unemployment rate was actually very low through March, and when you get unemployment income, we don't actually foresee an impact to tax next year because you still have to do your taxes because you were employed and you have unemployment income and so which means you have to do your taxes. So we actually do not see an impact from the number of people that will need to file IRS, when I look at the total number of IRS returns, this shouldn't have a dramatic impact for the reasons that I mentioned. The second is we are very focused on how we help serve these customers through our Live platform, and we believe that this could really be an impetus to deliver a great experience to deliver higher confidence and for you to be able to do it from the comfort of your home. So that's the answer to the question around unemployment. Headline news is folks are still going to have to do their taxes because unemployment rate was so low for the first several months of the year and you have to do your taxes because of unemployment income. The second in terms of indicators that we're looking at, I would say there are a few. One is just the number of workers and employees that are for instance tracking their time or are tracking their time through TSheets or getting paid through payroll or the number of payroll companies that are paying their employees. That is one very important indicator for us. The second is just what happens with charge volume. That is a very important indicator because it shows the strength of consumer spending with small businesses and small businesses and small business spending. So that's the second. And then third is the rate of acquisition and the rate of attrition. Those are all the trends that we look at. And I would just highlight one subset of all of this which is how QuickBooks Live performs in this environment. It's less about just QuickBooks Live but the notion of getting help. Although very early days with QuickBooks Live, we've been happy with the as we said earlier, with the acquisition trend that we've seen because more and more folks are not only looking to do things in a virtual world but are actually looking in this time frame to get help to clean up their books to ensure they're compliant and to become far more effective and efficient in how they run their business because again, money matters more than ever before. So those are the three, four indicators that we are looking at, and doubling down on the bets that I mentioned earlier because we believe just there's a huge opportunity to help customers shift to online to help customers shift to a virtual world and to be able to find more ways to put money in their pocket. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, I will. First of all, thank you for everyone's time and for joining today and your thoughtful questions. I would like to just close by once again, thanking our employees for just the incredible work that they've done being by the side of our customers and being empathetic and compassionate for what they've having to go through and also just the partnerships with our partners. I wish all of you on the call well. Please stay healthy. Take care of yourself, and we look forward to talking to you at the next earnings call. Take care, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon. And welcome to Intuit\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. I am here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I will turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Kim. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. I hope you are all safe and well. We had a very strong fourth quarter, capping off a dynamic fiscal year 2020. Full year revenue grew 13% and operating margin expanded. Total revenue growth was fueled by 15% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, and 13% growth in the Consumer Group. QBO and TTO platform revenue totaled $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2020, growing 22% year-over-year.  With our AI-driven expert platform strategy and the focus on our five Big Bets, we are building momentum and accelerating innovation in the current environment, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. Since we just finished tax season, let\u2019s start there. This tax season was like no other and our team delivered a strong season in an uncertain environment by executing on our strategy of expanding our lead in the Do-It-Yourself category, transforming the assisted category, and disrupting consumer finance. Based on our estimates, excluding stimulus filings of approximately $7 million to $8 million, the Do-It-Yourself category share grew over 2 points this season. We grew our share of total returns and posted 11% customer growth, the strongest in four years, while growing revenue double-digits for the third year in a row. We grew the base of customers paying us nothing just over 20%, posted double-digit growth of new customers across underpenetrated segments including Latinx, Self-Employed and customers with investments, and we grew TurboTax Live customers nearly 70%. Now turning to Small Business, revenue for the Small Business and Self-Employed group grew 16% in the fourth quarter and 15% for the year. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 29% in the fourth quarter, including 4 points of nonrecurring revenue from the Paycheck Protection Program and 31% for the year. We are seeing the resiliency of our platform following a different demand earlier this year when shelter-in-place shutdown many Small Businesses. We are now seeing recovering trends across our platforms, including improved retention rates, payment volumes and employees paid with our payroll offerings, as customers continue to rely on QuickBooks as the source of truth for their business. With that said, there remains a great deal of uncertainty in the market, particularly for Small Businesses as the pandemic continues to run its course. Next, I will turn to the progress of our AI-driven Expert Platform strategy and how we are executing against our five Big Bets. These Big Bets focus on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. I will cover big bet number one last as it accelerates innovation across our platform and is foundational to the other bets. Big bet number two is Connect People to Experts. One of the largest problems our customers face is lack of confidence to do their own taxes and to manage their business. We are connecting customers to experts on our platform to solve this problem with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, allowing us to reach more customers, deepen our engagement, and grow ARPC. Within TurboTax Live, we had a terrific season. The number of TurboTax Live customers grew nearly 70%. We provided new ways for customers to access an expert throughout the filing process, contributing to first-year retention and conversion rates increasing several points. And almost 70% of new TurboTax customers who used our Live offerings came from an assisted method the prior year, a higher percentage of TurboTax Online. For experts on our platform, we saw higher satisfaction scores and lower attrition as we focused on improving the expert experience. For QuickBooks Live, we are proud of the progress we have made this year building on the virtual expert platform we created for TurboTax Live. With the rapid adoption of virtual solutions, we continue to see encouraging early signs for QuickBooks Live as we further develop the offering with a higher percentage than expected of customers upgrading to a monthly subscription from our setup offering we introduced in January. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions by connecting customers with financial offerings that help put more money in their pockets. In its third season, we more than doubled monthly active use for Turbo and increased customer retention rates as we grew registered users by 8 million to 22 million. This suggests customers are finding value from our recently introduced innovations such as refund tracking and goal setting. We expect our pending acquisition of Credit Karma to be more important than ever in this challenging environment as we work to help consumers save money, get out of debt and have faster access to money. We continue to expect the transaction to close the second half of calendar year 2020. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of Small Business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence, and grow in an omnichannel world. We recently launched QuickBooks Cash, a Small Business bank account that provides full visibility into Small Businesses current and future financial picture with the ability to move money instantly and to ensure this money is working for them, while leveraging the built-in accounting capabilities of QuickBooks.  The cash account earns an attractive interest rate and enables Small Businesses to set aside funds for upcoming expenses and envelopes and comes with a debit card. It\u2019s fully integrated with QuickBooks Payment and Payroll, enabling a Small Business to pay a worker or vendor the same day they receive the funds from a customer. It also includes an integrated cash flow planner to predict future cash needs. We are very excited to learn fast and scale this new innovation. We continue to support our Small Business customers by helping them access the Paycheck Protection program or PPP in QuickBooks Capital. As of July 31ST, Intuit helped make available just over $1.2 billion of approved Small Business loans to customers. We have helped approximately 37,000 Small Businesses access the loans with an average loan of nearly $38,000, keeping over 220,000 employees on payrolls. Finally, following the announced acquisition of TradeGecko\u2019s robust inventory and order management system, we look forward to sharing more with you at Investor Day about how we will integrate these capabilities into QuickBooks to help Small Businesses manage and grow in an omnichannel environment. Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the Small Business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, designed to address the needs of small businesses with 10 to 100 employees. Throughout the last year, we introduced features to help customers individually tailor the offerings to their needs, including workflow automation, build your own dashboard, custom fields for expense transactions, and batch invoicing and payments. We also continue to work closely with partners to establish deeper integrations with premium apps with the goal to save our customer\u2019s time by personalizing the offering and improving their experience. Now more than ever, a simple flexible cloud offering is needed by mid-market customers at a disruptive price. Let me wrap up our Big Bets by circling back to Big Bet number one, which is our foundational bet to revolutionize speed to benefit our customers. Our goal is to put more money in our customer\u2019s pockets, eliminate friction, and deliver confidence at every touch point by using AI and customer insights. Here are a couple of examples of the progress that we are making. First, we accelerated use of AI and increased the number of models deployed across our platform by over 50% this year. This increased use of AI drove a variety of customer benefits, including saving customers 25,000 hours with self-help and cutting expert review time in half, improving customer confidence.  Second, we completed the migration of our data centers to the cloud, while expanding our core technology capabilities. This enables us to decrease downtime by 30%, tripled the speed of delivery on our modern development platform and increased mobile applications deployments by 60%. We can now launch new features in a fraction of the time it once took to deliver customer benefits with even greater speed. As I shared earlier, we believe the current environment is acting as an accelerant for these bets. Most everyone is looking for virtual solutions, Small Businesses are accelerating their shift to online and omnichannel commerce, and both consumers and small businesses are looking for ways to put more money in their pocket. To wrap up, I am incredibly proud of our accomplishments this year. We remain focused on what matters most to our customers and what we can control during this time of uncertainty. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. We are successfully executing on the principles we laid out last quarter for operating in a downturn. These principles are designed to accelerate our execution and help both our customers and Intuit emerge from the downturn stronger than ever. Let me now turn to our results. As a reminder, fourth quarter reflects -- fourth quarter results reflect a shift of a significant portion of tax filings out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered revenue of $1.8 billion, GAAP operating income of $483 million versus a loss of $153 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $616 million versus a loss of $47 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.68 versus a loss per share of $0.17 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.81 versus a loss per share of $0.09 last year. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue grew 13% in fiscal 2020, TurboTax units grew 11% and our retention rate increased again this year for our online tax customers. There are four primary drivers in our Consumer business. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. Based on the latest IRS data through July 24th, we estimate total returns including paper filings grew 3% to 4%. This excludes approximately $7 million to $8 million stimulus-only filings. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using Do-It-Yourself software. Excluding stimulus-only filings, we estimate category share grew over 2 points this season, the fastest pace in 15 years. As a reminder, the DIY category growth is our largest revenue growth lever. The third driver is our share within DIY, excluding stimulus-only filings, we estimate our share of total tax returns grew over 1.5 points and our share of the category was flat. The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. The growth reflects the stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and minor price increases in the premier product and state attached. Turning to the Strategic Partner Group, we reported $493 million of professional tax revenue in fiscal 2020, up 4%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed group, revenue grew 16% during the quarter and 15% in fiscal 2020, including nonrecurring PPP revenue. Excluding PPP, Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 13% during the quarter and 14% in fiscal 2020, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on small businesses. Online Ecosystem revenue remained resilient, with growth of 29% during the quarter and 31% during the year, including nonrecurring PPP revenue. Excluding PPP, Online Ecosystem revenue grew 25% in fiscal Q4 and 30% in fiscal 2020. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Last quarter, I shared recent business trends and I\u2019d like to update you on those same trends compared to pre-COVID levels in the first half of the third quarter. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 34% in fiscal Q4 driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and to a lesser extent mix shift. During the fourth quarter, QBO new customer acquisition accelerated by approximately 10 points versus the second half of the third quarter, but it\u2019s still down 5 points from pre-COVID levels. Retention within the existing customer base improved during Q4, but full year QBO retention is down two points to 77%. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue grew 21% in fiscal Q4 driven by payments, PPP loans, payroll and Time Tracking. Excluding non-recurring PPP revenue, Online Services revenue grew 12%. Within Payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full-service offerings. The number of workers paid was roughly flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter, improving from a 10% year-over-year decrease during the second half of the third quarter, but still 20 points below pre-COVID levels. Similarly, the number of companies running Payroll grew approximately 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, improving from flat year-over-year in the second half of the third quarter. This is still 5 points below pre-COVID levels. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Payment charge volume grew 15% in the fourth quarter, improving from flat year-over-year in the second half of the third quarter. This is still 15 points below pre-COVID levels. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q4. Total international online revenue grew 31%, reflecting subscriber and ARPC growth earlier in the fiscal year. Desktop Ecosystem revenue was up 3% in the fourth quarter and roughly flat for the year. Excluding nonrecurring PPP revenue, Desktop Ecosystem revenue was flat in the fourth quarter. The decline in Desktop units moderated in the fourth quarter and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits. Intuit helped facilitate more than $1.2 billion in Small Business loans from the Paycheck Protection Program through QuickBooks Capital. This resulted in approximately $30 million in non-recurring revenue in the fourth quarter. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment, though we recognize that we may not be able to achieve them in the current environment. During the fourth quarter, we refocused our investments to ensure our capabilities are aligned against our AI-driven expert platform strategy and Big Bets. This resulted in the departure of over 700 employees and a one-time charge of $43 million in both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We plan to hire about 700 employees in our most strategic areas including systems, full staff and beta engineering, data science, customer success and sales. Turning back to our financial principles, our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can\u2019t invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $7.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. In June, we issued $2 billion in senior notes to fund a portion of the Credit Karma acquisition and for other general corporate purposes. These notes carry a blended coupon rate of 1.15%. Following the end of the quarter, we repaid the $1 billion balance on our revolver. We did not repurchase any stock during the fourth quarter, as we have temporarily suspended share repurchases in conjunction with the Credit Karma acquisition. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our authorization and we expect to be in the market in the future. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share payable October 19, 2020. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. Looking ahead to fiscal 2021, while we are not providing company level guidance today reflecting uncertainty in Small Business trends, we believe the current environment accelerated our consumer results this season, creating a more challenging comparison for next year. We see several scenarios for how the economic recovery may impact our Small Business performance and that we are considering as we run the business. The first scenario is that the pace of economic recovery continues at its current pace, reaching normalized growth in the spring of 2021. Under this scenario, we could see Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew high-single digits. The second scenario is a more gradual opening of the economy, including ongoing headwinds from Small Business failures. This W-shaped recovery assumes cases increase during the winter months coinciding with our peak season in the U.S. Under this scenario, we could see Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grow mid-single digits. The third scenario is a choppy recovery and more than one wave of Small Business failures or shutdowns, creating a double W-shaped recovery. Under this scenario, we could see Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue flat-to-up low-single digits. In addition, we expect a slower Small Business and Self-Employed revenue growth in the first half, as compared to the second half of fiscal 2021. We supported customers during the second half of 2020 by delaying price increases, migration to our new payroll offerings and upgrades to QBO Advanced. As a reminder, we began rolling out a QBO price increase in first quarter of fiscal 2020 and will start lapping the full impact of that increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Keep in mind that there is also a lagging impact to QuickBooks Online accounting revenue from the slower customer acquisition and higher attrition we experienced during third quarter. To reiterate, our long-term expectations include revenue growth of 8% to 12% for the Consumer Group and 10% to 15% for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. We continue to expect Online Ecosystem revenue growth of more than 30% longer term. Lastly, we expect a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for fiscal 2021. And with that, I will turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thanks, Michelle. I am very proud of the team and all that we have accomplished together in fiscal year 2020. We are uniquely positioned to make a positive impact on the world, as our mission has never been more meaningful than now to power prosperity around the world. I look forward to sharing with you how our strategy of an AI-driven expert platform and our five Big Bets are accelerating innovation at our virtual Investor Day on September 23rd. Let\u2019s now open it up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much, and congrats on a really strong finish to the year. Sasan, I wanted to get your take on some recent forecasts that have been made by the IRS, that there would be about 37 million fewer W-2 employee-classified jobs in 2021, with this lower level of employment persisting through 2027 and they also see fewer filings of 1099 forms and about 1.6 million more gig workers. So number one, how important or accurate do you think these forecasts are? And two, does this reality or environment impact how you will be thinking about the medium-term growth algorithm of the tax business especially as it relates to overall filings? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Thanks, Brad. I hope all is well with you my friend. Brad Zelnick : Likewise. Sasan Goodarzi : So let me -- I am aware of the stats, maybe if I can just touch on history and touch on how we think about the future. If I take us back to the recession in 2008 and the way that played out in \u201808 and \u201809, what we saw in filings was they were kind of flat to down just a little bit. And so even in very tough times, you saw a general flat environment when it came to number of filings. Now, these times are a bit different than \u201808 and \u201809, but history is always important to look at. When we look ahead, a couple of things, one is unemployment was very low at the beginning of this fiscal year and unemployment also gets taxed. And so when we think about 2021 and beyond, there may be -- the filings maybe down a bit, or they may be close to flat. It does not at all change our strategic focus. And just as a refresher we are really focused on expanding our Do-It-Yourself category. There\u2019s still a massive opportunity that I believe we are just getting started and transforming the assisted category. And so when you look at our penetration and the assisted category when you look at the opportunity we still have in expanding the Do-It-Yourself category, we believe that the long-term expectations of what we have set around 8% to 12% Consumer Group revenue growth still stands. So that\u2019s how we think about the couple of years that are upcoming given the number of folks that are unemployed. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much for that, Sasan. And Michelle, if I can just follow up with you on your comments about a difficult compare in tax into this year, specifically if we think about a very strong penetration and growth in TTL. Is it fair to say that investors should expect slowing of the penetration rate just because, I mean, this year seems to have been clearly a perfect storm if anybody were to enter the category and especially to try TTL, how are you thinking about that? Thank you. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Brad. I hope you are doing well too. I would say a couple of things, what Sasan just said applies to your question. Our strategic focus is not changing. We continue to focus on expanding our lead in DIY and also transforming assisted with the TurboTax Live product. There may have been some -- a little bit more of a challenge this year, more people filing from home. But we think that there\u2019s just a large opportunity for us to continue to focus on our strategy of bringing folks into the category and bringing folks into TurboTax Live. We are really proud of the progress we have made this year with the 70% increase in customers and we do believe that we will continue to build on the tailwinds from this year. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : One thing I will add, oh, sorry, Brad. Brad Zelnick : Yes. Sasan Goodarzi : Just one thing I would add that\u2019s complementary to what Michelle just shared. The facts are always friendly, right? And when you think about those 86 million folks in the assisted category, it\u2019s a $20 billion TAM and this is now heading into our sort of fourth year in transforming the category. We have not really even hit the inflection point of what\u2019s possible, so just it\u2019s an important reminder that we are in the early days of transforming the assisted category. Brad Zelnick : Perfect. Thank you again so much, and congrats again, and hope everybody stays well. Sasan Goodarzi : Okay. Thank you, Brad. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Ken Wong : Great. Thank you for taking my question. First -- the first question is for you, Sasan. In the past, you have mentioned, e-commerce as being a top priority, you guys made the acquisition of TradeGecko earlier. Just wondering kind of where we are in terms of that particular strategy, anything else that needed to be tacked on here? Just would love to get some color on kind of how you are envisioning that part of your business, especially with the shift to e-commerce so evident this year? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Ken, I hope you are doing well. In terms of the question around e-commerce, I think, the place I would start is one of the companies\u2019 five Big Bets is about being the center of Small Business growth with a particular focus on transforming omnichannel commerce. And the biggest thing that we have found in all homes and the tests that we have run this past year is for our customers is actually quite easy to launch on new channels, whether it\u2019s Etsy, whether it\u2019s Instagram, whether it\u2019s Facebook, Amazon. The biggest challenge they have is they actually choke their growth, because they really lose sight of which customers are coming from which channels, the profitability, the connection to their inventory and ultimately fulfillment. So the worst thing for a Small Business, particularly the ones that we serve is not being able to fulfill an order. So really our focus is to truly be an agnostic open platform to partner with the channels that are out there, again, the ones that I mentioned, also partner with those that provide websites and also the PLS providers, while really focusing on the core of what matters most to our customers and our core competency, which is around helping customers -- our customers with understanding the profitability by channel, connecting them to inventory. And so our acquisition of TradeGecko is, I think, a huge first step and we will share what we are launching at Investor Day, that really focuses on inventory order management and allows our customers to really take control of the thing that right now they don\u2019t have control of to give them the confidence to then open up across other channels. And so we will not only share what we are launching at Investor Day, but we will also reiterate the vision and where we are headed, what you can expect from us in the years to come. But this is a really important first step given all the work that we have done in the last year to be positioned to go after the, I would say, the highest order problem that our customers face. Ken Wong : Okay. Perfect. And then, Michelle, a quick question for you. You gave us a rough sense of what the PPP impact was on revenue, just wonder if you can maybe give us a sense of how that might have impacted margins and earnings just so we make sure that we don\u2019t kind of rattle through profitability that might be more one-time-ish? Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Ken. Yes. We are really proud of the work that the team did utilizing our platform and our modern technology to be able to turn so quickly to provide $1.2 billion in access to PPP loans for our Small Business customers in such a rough environment. As for margins, I would say, we really do manage our margins at the company level and that\u2019s really how we think about this $30 million of revenue. Also, I would tell you that, given the environment, the tightening of credit that we had done, this was really more of a trade-off for the QuickBooks Capital team and really putting the majority of their focus on PPP versus extending credit through QuickBooks Capital. Ken Wong : Got it. Appreciate that. Thank you, Michelle. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of RBC. Your line is open. Robert Simmons : Hi. This is Robert Simmons on for Alex. You kind of suggested this, but with the acquisition, can you talk about what else you need to do to deliver on your omnichannel plans? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Robert. Sure. I think, the way you ought to think about it is when you put yourself in the shoes of the Small Business. There\u2019s a few things that they need to be able to do. They depending on their products, may want to get set up on what we call mega channels. Again, it could be the walmart.com, Etsy, Amazon, Instagram. They may want to be able to also have their own store set up. They may want to ensure that they have a PLS provider to be able to transact with customers in a physical world. So then they also need to be able to manage all of their financials. They need to understand the profitability of their customers. It\u2019s got to be connected to inventory, so inventory can automatically remind them that they are about to run out of inventory and to order more and to be able to fulfill their orders on time and so shipments and delivery on time. And also ensuring that their accounting is done right, that they are compliant and if they need access to money and loans, that they have that ability, and in that context of making sure, when you think about our platform, we have really been positioned over the years to deliver for service based businesses and this is an area where we believe we have a right to win to deliver product for product based businesses when it comes to financial compliance. So right now our initial focus is really just nailing order management and inventory management. It\u2019s actually critical to ensuring that our customers have the confidence they can fulfill orders and actually understand their profitability, while we then establish partnerships beyond that with some of the channels that, I mentioned, the PLS providers and even some of the website builders. We truly want to be an open agnostic platform to focus on the problems that matter most and we believe an open platform is necessary to be able to ensure that customers have choice in how they choose to run their business. So initial focus is inventory and order management and this is really about rapid testing, experimentation and scaling what works well, and that\u2019s the way we are thinking about it. Robert Simmons : Got it. Great. Thanks. That makes sense. And then you also talked about what you have seen in terms of retention so far this fiscal year. I realize it\u2019s only been not quite four weeks, but have you seen it stabilize or has it improved and what you are expecting going forward? Sasan Goodarzi : We have as you heard Michelle talk to, we have experienced really all of our key trends improve and retention specific to your question has improved from what we talked about last quarter. We do expect that it will be down approximately 2 points for the year, but we have seen an improvement over the last quarter. And I think more broadly, I would say, that being the source of truth for our customer\u2019s business has always been the case, but I think this pandemic has actually even made us more relevant because the shift to online whether it\u2019s payments, payroll, accounting, compliance, it\u2019s just become even more critical than it was four months or five months ago and so that over time may actually even impact retention more so. But we expect to be down 2 points for the year, and again, the trends have improved. Robert Simmons : Got it. Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : You are very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just want to ask you, Sasan, on your Big Bet number two about connecting experts through a live platform. First on the TurboTax Live, I think, the question would be retaining those live customers, although, it\u2019s too hard to say at this point, but could you share what kind of Net Promoter Score or any kind of feedback that your experts took from those new customers? That would be helpful. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure. Good to hear from you, Siti, and thank you for your kind words. We are really proud of the progress in TurboTax Live. Just as a reminder, one of the biggest things that we learned last year was we needed to really improve the first-time experience and the first user experience for our customers. We need to make sure that they had really access to an expert throughout the offering and actually reminding them that they have an access to an expert along the way. And on the other side, making the experience just really drop-dead easy for our experts, making sure that at the fingertips of our experts is insight for our customers from the moment they engage them, whether it\u2019s through chat or through video that they can resolve their issue. This is really -- this is a digital platform and it\u2019s a service offering. So the experts play such a critical role in the experience. And I would tell you that across the Board, the metrics that we look at are retention, conversion. It\u2019s PRS, product recommendation score for both the customer that is using the platform and also the experts. The happier the expert is, the more they feel they can solve the customer\u2019s problem, the higher in essence the recommendation score they give. And then we also look at efficiency, are they effectively able to solve the customers\u2019 problem? And across the Board, across every metric, it\u2019s been up and to the right, and so we have a lot of confidence. We are better this year than we were last year and I have every bit of confidence that we will be better a year from now. But across all of those key metrics, we significantly improved and so I would just expect our momentum and the kind of focus that our employees have on our customers to deliver better experiences, both our customers and our experts. So that\u2019s a little bit of a snapshot as to the progress that we have made up and to the right on all of the key metrics. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for that color. And a quick follow-up on the QBO side, it\u2019s actually surprising to see that 10-point acceleration of new customer acquisitions. So this is your full quarter of this pandemic impact. I am wondering what\u2019s driving that new customer growth although it\u2019s still below pre-COVID levels, but it is more people realize the complexity of PPP or any other driver, that would be helpful? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. One of the things that we have seen and we are fortunate that our Big Bets are the core of the shift, which is we are seeing more and more folks shift to a virtual world. We are seeing more and more folks want to shift to online solutions and omnichannel solutions. And then third is money matters more than ever, whether you are a Consumer, Self-Employed or Small Business. And I think the thing that we are experiencing although to your point that we are not at pre-COVID level yet -- levels yet, many customers are seeing that using our cloud offering gives them the ability to be able to engage with customers in the cloud and to help them avoid interaction in the physical world, higher usage of payments and payroll potentially over time, and frankly being compliant, a lot of customers realize that they weren\u2019t compliant and it was hard for them to get access to loans. So I think this environment has just -- we are seeing that shift to the cloud, and I think, that\u2019s why we have seen an acceleration in our acquisition compared to where we were just a quarter ago, although still below the pre-COVID levels. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you so much, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : You are very welcome. Be safe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Sasan, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit on the Small Business side. Just how sensitive are customers to pricing changes right now given the economic backdrop and I guess how does that influence your strategy around maybe some of your higher value products like QBO Live and QBO Advanced as you go into fiscal 2021. Just trying to get a sense on does the macro dynamic have an influence on your strategy around that? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Kirk, good to hear from you and I hope you are safe and well. Particularly in the area that you asked the question, we are actually the low-cost alternative both with QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advanced. When you look at QuickBooks Advanced, first of all, this is one of the teams that just is innovating at a very rapid pace to ensure that our mid-market customers have all the capabilities that they need to be able to run their business, whether it\u2019s something we have built or other apps that our partners build on our platform, but in a very disruptive price. So I would say in some ways, QuickBooks Advanced becomes even more attractive than otherwise in this current environment because we are the low cost provider. And I would say the same thing for QuickBooks Live. These are folks that ultimately come to us that have been using bookkeepers and accountants and they are very dialed into what they have been paying and they really come to us because of the experience that they have had potentially with their bookkeepers and accountants, whereas we have a set of standards around what we expect in terms of the experience that our bookkeepers need to deliver for our customers. And so in that case, we also tend to be the low-cost provider and so we have become even more attractive in an environment like this. So that\u2019s the way we think about pricing. We believe that in these two areas, we are actually probably more attractive choice than others. Kirk Materne : Okay. And then just the second question from me would be just in the SMB sort of area of your business any major changes in what you are seeing in terms of either customer acquisition or retention rate when you think about the U.S. versus some of your smaller regions, the U.K., international regions, I was just wondering if you have seen any real differences from a geographic perspective? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Absolutely. From a geographic perspective, I would say, the U.S. is probably holding up the strongest, probably next followed by Canada and then the U.K. But I would say, U.S. is held up the strongest and I think a lot of it just has to do with the nature of how the health crisis is being managed and how open the economy is, because all these Small Businesses have one commonality across the world. They are passionate about what they do and it\u2019s the way they earn their living, but with that said, U.S. has been the strongest. And of course, from the trends perspective, as you heard from Michelle, we have seen across the Board our trends improve and now stabilize. They are not at pre-COVID levels. But I would say solid improvement just in the last three months as the economy has opened up a bit. Kirk Materne : Thank you. Stay well. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Hey. Good afternoon, Sasan. Just following up on Kirk\u2019s comments on SMB, I guess, you have seen such a surge in the front office with CRM, wicks, number of the companies doing extremely well and I think part of the logic many investors are following is that inevitably companies have to turn back to the back office at the end of the day and if you are driving all this online traffic, you have got to drive the back office as well and more around kind of the shape of the recovery and do you believe that you can benefit from the surge you are seeing in the front office that is an indication that it\u2019s good signs for your SMB business going forward? And maybe if you could just highlight where you think the biggest opportunities are? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Sure, Brent. Good to hear from you, and again, I hope you are safe and well. First of all, I would start with the point you made which is exactly right. At the end of the day, getting a store set up to be able to do business, you have to be able to accept payments, you have to -- you want to hire contractors or full-time employees, you have to use payroll, especially if you are a younger smaller business, you need access to loans and so then you need to make sure that you are compliant. And so that\u2019s where all of our services come in and why they -- why even in this environment as we look ahead, our services become even more critical to ensure a customer can be organized, get paid and run their business profitability. So with that as context, I think, the second context I would just bring up is, it is remarkable how resilient our platform and business model is. You saw what happened last quarter when we talked about some of the trends and how the trends had kind of fallen off given that we shutdown the economy in the U.S. and how they have bounced back. Again, all still not to pre-COVID levels but they have bounced back. And so really to, I think, the second part of your question, the way we are thinking about the future is in context of what you heard from Michelle. If the economy continues on the track that it\u2019s on and gets to normalized levels in spring of 2021, as long as Small Businesses are able to do business, I think, our platform is going to benefit. So a lot of our performance because the platform is resilient, the business model is resilient, it\u2019s more than ever it\u2019s times like this when customers need our platform. I think a lot of it will just depend on how the economy opens up because we are in the cloud, we have capabilities in the cloud, and our customers need our capabilities plus we are an agnostic platform. We believe the way you deliver for customers is to have partnerships with all these key players and I just think that that advantages our network, but that\u2019s the way we think about it. Brent Thill : Great. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Mark Rende : Hi. This is Mark Rende on for Keith Weiss. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong results. I just wanted to ask, you discussed the TurboTax share within the DIY category was flat year-over-year compared to I think prior years the TurboTax gained share. So what are you seeing in the competitive environment and just like the competitive intensity in the DIY online filing market? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Very good question. And it\u2019s actually we think about the category very differently now than we did four to five years ago and for us it\u2019s about the entire category of filers and not just about the Do-It-Yourself category. So just if I could refresh us on the fact that the do-it-yourself category is about $6 billion TAM, the assisted category is about $20 billion in TAM, and of course, what we declared in consumer finance is north of $55 million in the TAM. And so for us, what is most important is the share that we have in the entire category and so we are very, very pleased with the fact that our share of the entire category is up 1.5 points and that is really how we measure success, and that is really our goal line, because when you think about the dollar share of the Do-It-Yourself category, we have the majority of the share, we are focused on the assisted category, whether it\u2019s $20 billion of opportunity for us. Mark Rende : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And then maybe one quick one, just in terms of it\u2019s been asked a couple times, but to ask it slightly differently, have you seen a change in kind of the profile of new QuickBooks subscribers maybe post-COVID versus pre-COVID, like, for instance, has there been uptick in kind of acquisitions with QuickBooks Self-Employed, and kind of if so, what impact did that have an ARPC moving forward? Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : You are very welcome. So a couple of things I would say, one is, it is inspirational and remarkable how resilient Small Businesses are and how they are looking to adjust how they can still serve their customers. And I would just say, that\u2019s an uber point where if one door shuts for them, they open up another door to figure out if there is a different way to serve their customers. So that\u2019s really important to recognize and as long as they can manage their task load, they are going to find other ways to be able to serve their customers, which really gets to the second point and that is I think there -- it\u2019s become very apparent, one, how meaningful and relevant we are in this environment to help our customers operate in the cloud. There was an element of well, I can just manage through multiple different, use paper and pen and my bookkeeper to run my business. I think people are now seeing, hey, what, I can be far more effective invoicing and getting paid instantly, being able to do payroll and ensure that I am accurate in my payroll, so I am not paying penalties or ensuring that I am organized, so I understand my task force, especially with a lot of launches that we talked about with our QuickBooks cash and cash flow planner to be effective. So I think what you are seeing is I have an opportunity to much more effective and efficient with my cash flow using Intuit\u2019s platform and the cloud, and the resiliency of our Small Businesses just finding new and unique ways to do business, while we are I think experiencing the bounce back relative to the last quarter. Again, reminding us though that they are still not at the pre-COVID levels. Mark Rende : Got it. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Yeah. It was a really strong quarter in Consumer. I am curious kind of the high level question is how should we think about margin in that segment going forward? I see it was down about 100 bps year-over-year for the full year and I am guessing if you can elaborate you got some nice leverage in TurboTax Live staffing, getting more efficient there, and clearly, you have got good volume growth in revenue per return growth. But I know you spent a little higher marketing in the fiscal fourth quarter just due to the change in the year and then a lot more free file alliance clients this year, you addressed the percentage of folks that you serve free. So just if you can address how we would think about that going longer term and maybe some puts and takes in the quarter? Thanks -- or in the year, rather? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Yeah. Sure, Scott. Good to hear from you. Hope you are well. I would focus on the fact that we truly manage investments and margins at the company level. What really matters most is that we delivered 13% revenue and 17% operating income both GAAP and non-GAAP and EPS grew 16%. And so our leverage is more and more at the company level, because we are truly more and more building services across our platform at the company level. And so margin levels moving up or down a point, I wouldn\u2019t get overly excited about it at the segment level, because of the fact that we are making our investment choices the way we are running the company is more and more at a platform across the company. So I would really look at company level performance and not just segment level performance because of how we are making our investment choices and we are getting a lot of leverage because of the way we are doing it. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. And on a follow-up, it\u2019s kind of a two-part here and I am not sure how much you are going to address. But your main tax competitor mentioned that they probably leave or almost definitively would leave the free file alliance going forward, I am just curious your take on that program and obviously you addressed the free customers you served this year. And then also with Credit Karma, there are tax customers in that, just any comments about that and the deal that you could comment on? Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Absolutely. So let me just first share with you the objectives that we have that we shared in previous years when it comes to taxes. One is, we are a big believer in voluntary tax. Two, we are a big believer that those that are deserving whether it\u2019s income levels and military and we want to make sure that they can get their taxes done for free and in some cases philosophy. And last but not least is, we always want to enhance our reputation, so that\u2019s kind of one bucket of objectives to think about. The second is our strategy and it\u2019s very much intertwined. When we talk about the notion of expanding our lead in the Do-It-Yourself category transforming the assisted category and disrupting consumer finance, the core part of our strategy is actually for those that deserve it to give them the ability to do their taxes for free because over time they can not only grow with us but also we can solve other problems beyond tax. So that\u2019s the way we think about our strategy, that\u2019s the way we think about our innovation and we are very dedicated to helping those that deserve it most to get their taxes done for free. So that\u2019s -- those are the things that ultimately inform how we think about SLK. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I wonder if you could remind us what portion of the QuickBooks users also are using Payroll at this point? In other words, what visibility do you have in terms of the potential of impending business closures and when that kind of headwind might peak and start to subside for you? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Sterling, thank you for the question. First of all, we don\u2019t break out what the percentage of our base is that uses Payroll. But what I would share is some of the stats and take you back to some of the stats that Michelle shared, which is, we have actually seen a nice bounce back of companies in essence running Payroll. It\u2019s still below pre-COVID levels, but we have seen a nice bounce back. And they have less employees but the number of companies running payroll has bounced back nicely. I think that\u2019s one indication that we look at. I think the broader indication that we look at is really cash flow and when we look at across our base, remember, 70% of our base of service-based businesses, whether it\u2019s real estate, landscaping, bookkeeping, computer and software. We look across who we serve and we also look by state, which is very different. We are seeing a nice bounce back in places like North Carolina, Georgia, New Jersey and Arizona, but on the other hand states that are recovering slower New York, California, Michigan, just to give a couple of examples. And when we look across industries and across those states, this is based on our own analysis of those that have connected to QuickBooks their bank accounts. We see their bank averages could range from being down 10% to up towards 20%. So what we really monitor is cash flow, because that is ultimately the biggest indication as to whether or not are they going to be able to make it through these times and that is really what we are -- what informs some of the indicators that you heard Michelle talk to. And last but not least, we expect our retention to be down about 2 points this year given some of what we experienced with our customers being shut down. Sterling Auty : Understood. Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : You are very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Your question, please. Jennifer Lowe : Thank you. I just wanted to touch quickly on TurboTax Live and you gave a stat earlier about the very strong adoption you saw in TurboTax Live within customers that had converted off of Pro this tax season. This season was obviously a very unusual one all around. But I am curious if that uptake or that experience if you find some of the weighting between increased retention of existing customers and not having them go to Pro versus pulling customers away from Pro. Does that give you any conviction that maybe it\u2019s -- there\u2019s more opportunity to put a marketing push behind getting customers away from Pro and on to TurboTax Live than maybe you would have thought before the season? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Jen, thank you for your question and hope you are well and safe. We have never lacked conviction around TurboTax Live. We believe that we are just at the beginning of really creating a platform that goes viral, because the more people that do their taxes digitally with help coming to them in any frame that they need it, whether it\u2019s in their home or in their office, the more they are going to tell others and the more this will go viral. And I think, as I have shared before, based on the research and work that we have done, out of the 86 million folks that use an assisted method, about 70 million or so are willing to switch. So our focus has been experimenting, learning, looking at our results both in terms of how we raise awareness, how we bring folks into consideration and then the experience that we deliver on the platform. And I would just tell you that a year later we are a lot better than we were this time last year, particularly this extended tax season, albeit we all wished it would have ended in April given the tax put on our employees. We were able to actually experiment for another three months. So we ran a lot of tests on our platform and both in terms of how to raise awareness but also how to really nail the experience when customers come in. And as I mentioned earlier, all of our metrics, conversion, retention, PRS for both customers and our experts were all up and to the right. So based on what we learned this year, not just the results, but more importantly the learning, that actually gives us a lot more conviction of what we need to do for this coming tax season and even beyond. And so we feel blessed with the insights of learnings and we will absolutely be leaning in. But not just because of our results. We have had a lot of conviction, but just because of our learnings it allows us to be clear in terms of where we point our innovation. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : You are very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open. Michael Millman : Thank you. So do you believe that assuming businesses have a tough time going forward if the virus continues that many of those unemployed will turn to being Self-Employed and in fact that your numbers will actually increase? And also on the tax, do you believe that people who have done their taxes at home this year are unlikely to switch back if indeed they are physically able to switch back? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Michael, thank you for your question and I also hope you are safe and well. Let me hit on two things. I mean, I think, one, what I would say based on history. We know that we are a globe of entrepreneurs. And sometimes it\u2019s out of passion for an idea that you have and sometimes it\u2019s because you need to figure out a way to create income. And so at the end of the day, we don\u2019t build our business on hoping that there will be a lot of SMB new starts, but certainly in an environment like this could be a trigger for new Self-Employed and Small Businesses, and we certainly, want to be there for them the moment they have an idea and a passion to pursue something. And as you heard from Michelle earlier, just a lot of it depends on just how we see the health crisis play out and therefore the impact on the economy. On the tax side on your question about the experience that folks may have gotten whether or not they would be unlikely to switch back to their old method. The thing that we have learned over the years, this isn\u2019t the first year that we have gotten a lot of our customers from the assisted segment. It all comes down to the experience. And the confidence that they have in doing their taxes right, the confidence that they have in getting their maximum refund and we feel good about the experience that we delivered this year for customers based on our product recommendation scores. And so we also learned a lot in terms of what we need to do to continue to improve our platform. So we would hope that our retention rates play out next year the way they have in previous years, but it\u2019s primarily because of the type of experience that we deliver and of course this time next year will be far better in terms of the experiences that we will deliver, that we are even now given our rapid testing and learning mindset. So that\u2019s the way I would think about your two questions. Michael Millman : Thank you. Appreciate it. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Michael Millman : Be safe. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Thank you. You too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Michael Turrin : Hey, there. Thanks. Good afternoon. We have touched on margin a few times, but we were impressed you were actually able to expand margin this year given the extended tax filing season even with the PPP offset, was that within your own internal expectations given the spillover on the tax side and is there any additional color you can add around whether that improvement could prove more durable as you continue to drive towards delivering higher value on both segments? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Michael, thank you for your question. First of all, I would start with the principles that Michelle talked about earlier and I will just touch on a few of them as a starting point to answer your question, because it is how we run the company. And ultimately our principles are we want to grow revenue double-digits. We want to grow operating income faster than revenue. We want to make sure that we get 15% return on our investments and ensure that we solve our customer\u2019s most important problems. In that context and you have heard Michelle and I talk about it in the last year that we are really just continuing to be at the beginning of our platform journey. And that journey really means that we are going to continue to get better at building services one so that they can be used across the company. You heard some of our metrics around 50% increase in the number of AI models we have deployed this year, our velocity being up 3X compared to last year. That\u2019s all innovation. But that\u2019s also efficiency and effectiveness. And although, we don\u2019t set out a specific goal of increasing operating margins, because we want to make sure that we can simply deliver against the principle of operating income growing faster than revenue, I think, the result of becoming more effective and efficient could suggest that over time our operating margins will expand. And as you said yourself, we did actually spend more money in tax this year because of the extended season. It was both in marketing and customer success because we wanted to be there for our customers, because in essence we had two tax seasons in one. So we actually did spend more money. And as you saw, we expanded our operating margins because I think we are starting to see the leverage of our platform and that was not by accident. Michael Turrin : That\u2019s great. Thanks. Nice close to the year. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Josh Beck : Thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about QuickBooks Cash. It seems like an interesting extension of your services and really gets you a little bit more into banking and debit card. So it\u2019s probably a little too early, I am guessing to talk about the adoption curves. But would love to hear just kind of your ambitions for this product and where it could go over a multi-year period? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you for your question, Josh, and hope you are safe and well. First of all, you said it, we are very, very early. We have been working on this for some time, but we are very early, but we are very excited and I wouldn\u2019t think about QuickBooks Cash as a service. I would think about it as a very disruptive way for achieving this notion of truly being the source of truth for a customer\u2019s business. And just think about it in terms of a place where you can receive and send money. So when you do work for a customer and you invoice them, it automatically gets dumped into your QuickBooks Cash account where you can in essence have interest that you gain on your money, a place that you can just pay your employees right out of your QuickBooks Cash account, a place where you can buy inventory from your QuickBooks Cash account, a place where you can get access to capital from your QuickBooks Cash account. And while you are doing all that, because it\u2019s all happening in your QuickBooks Cash account, the accounting is actually getting done for you and so you don\u2019t actually have to do a bunch of reconciliation. That\u2019s really what we are focused on really creating in terms of a benefit for our customers and something that customers won\u2019t tell you that they need this, but when you really listen to what gets in their way, it\u2019s just can I have something that everything gets done for me and that\u2019s really the intent of QuickBooks Cash. We are just excited with the launch. We are excited to learn, to adjust, to test and to scale this very fast and it\u2019s something that we are going to talk about our virtual gallery walk at Investor Day in September. So hopefully that entices you to show up. It should be fun. Josh Beck : Yeah. That\u2019s a great pitch there for the day, so excited about that. And just quickly on Live, the 70% growth, nearly 70% in customers, seems like a really good result. So I am just curious was that ahead of plan and anything that stood out to there, and maybe how we could think about the retention of Live customers from a prior season versus the kind of net new that you get this season? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. I would tell you that as tradition would hold for Intuit, we always set very, very ambitious goals for ourselves for the near-term and for the long-term, because it really just forces us to take bigger swings for our customers. So I won\u2019t get into how we did versus our internals. But what I would tell you is that we feel truly terrific about the results, because literally on every dimension that you look at it, new customers growing 70%, 70% coming from the assisted segment, conversion being up year-over-year, retention being up year-over-year, PRX being up for our customers, PRX being up for our experts, our experts actually being very efficient delivering the 60 million hours that they engaged with our customers. We are really happy with the end result because it was truly an end to end experience that the team delivered. And we learned a ton, we learned what was not working. We learned how to be more effective. We learned how to deploy our AI models even more effectively, so that we can have the insights at the fingertips of our experts so they can deliver for customers. This is truly a digital service experience and so we are excited for next year and the next five years to come. Josh Beck : Really helpful, Sasan. Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : You are very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hi, Sasan. Interested in your thoughts on QBO, I think, you and Michelle talked about price increases and obviously they are going to be a little bit more difficult in the upcoming fiscal year and I am wondering at what point do you feel comfortable increasing prices on QBO SKUs? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Kartik, good to hear your voice and hope you are also keeping well my friend. So I think the uber point, I would say, is we are just obsessively focused on our customers. When you think about what our teams did in the last 12 weeks with PPP, with the GoFundMe platform that funded $37 million, with our Instant Deposit being free through July. Just to name a few, extending the deferred payment of our QuickBooks Capital customers, those that were really struggling and needed the help. We will make the right choice for our customers, and ultimately, we want to make sure that the value equation makes sense based on the rapid progress of our innovation and the fact that our speed of innovation is up 3x versus last year. So we always want to make sure that the value equation makes sense. But we are just going to see how the health crisis plays out and how the economy plays out and make our pricing decisions based on the principles that we have at the right time and this isn\u2019t the time to share when that is, because we really want to see how things play out. But that\u2019s principally the way we think about it. Kartik Mehta : And then just as a follow-up, Sasan, in the past, you have always had capability to QBO making the product better and better. If the economy doesn\u2019t allow for a price increase, would you continue to add capabilities and try to capture the value at some later point? Sasan Goodarzi : Absolutely. And in fact, I would tell you that we play the long game here when it comes to our R&D investments, and as I mentioned earlier, I think, we are just picking up momentum truly operating as a platform company and the innovation that we delivered this year was just -- got accelerated from just even a year ago. And by the way, that\u2019s been the trend we have been on for the company for the last 37 years and so we are actually -- we use opportunities like this to accelerate innovation and become much more effective, because we know one day we are going to get the value for it, for our customers and for shareholders. So the short answer or the long answer, I should say is, absolutely yes. Kartik Mehta : I appreciate it. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. You are very welcome. Stay safe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. And just following up on the last line of questioning, Sasan, from a high level, as you add more product to the QuickBooks platform. How do you decide what should be bundled and what should be charged for? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Hi, Brad. Hope you are well and safe. Ultimately, it\u2019s the test that we run. It is very similar to what we do in TurboTax and across the Live platform. At the end of the day, it comes down to understanding the benefit that you are delivering and whether or not a customer is willing to pay for it. But we also think about it relative to the impact on retention in the long-term. And so based on those in essence levers that inform the things that we test inclusive of even tests to come where we may choose to have accounting being free but then charge for services. So it really comes down to the experiments that we run and we let the data help inform strategically the choices that we make and that\u2019s primarily the way we have operated for years across the company. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much Sasan Goodarzi : You are very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I am not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. I will. Just wanted to thank everyone for your time and all the great questions today and I want to just close by once again thanking our employees and our customers and partners. We would not be where we are without the incredible stakeholders that we serve and we look forward to seeing all of you at our virtual Investor Day in September. Until then be safe and be well. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Latif, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon. And welcome to Intuit\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2021 conference call. I am here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2020 and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thanks, Kim. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. I hope you are all doing well. We had a very strong start to fiscal year 2021. First quarter revenue grew 14%. Total revenue growth was driven by 13% growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, while Consumer Group and ProConnect Group revenue was in line with our expectations in a seasonally small quarter. This is a great start to the year in a challenging environment, which reinforces the resiliency of our platform. We\u2019re growing more confident in how our business is performing in the current environment, although macro uncertainty remains. We continue to see recovering trends across our platform with many QuickBooks indicators back to pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, I\u2019m happy to announce that we will provide guidance for fiscal year 2021, which Michelle will cover in more detail later. At our September Investor Day, we shared the acceleration of innovation, driven by our AI-driven expert platform strategy and our 5 Big Bets, highlighting our growth potential. During the Platform Immersion Experience, we demonstrated progress against each Big Bet. What I\u2019d like to do is highlight a few of the innovations and cover Big Bet number one last as it accelerates innovation across our platform and it\u2019s foundational to the other bets. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We\u2019re solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. We grew the number of TurboTax Live customers on our platform at nearly 70% last season while increasing our expert product recommendation scores by 4 points. The team is hard at work as we prepare for the season ahead. We\u2019re also proud of the progress we\u2019ve made with QuickBooks Live, which is built on the same expert platform. We already have more than 600 experts serving customers today, with some of these experts serving both Taps and small business customers. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. We expect our pending acquisition of Credit Karma to be more important than ever as we work to help consumers save money, get out of debt and have faster access to money. We expect to complete the acquisition before the end of this calendar year. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow. QuickBooks Cash helps small businesses manage working capital by providing visibility into their financial picture while providing them with the ability to move money instantly and ensure their money is working for them, all while leveraging the built-in accounting of QuickBooks. We launched QuickBooks Commerce in September to better serve the 1 million product-based businesses on our platform by providing inventory and order management tools they need to grow their businesses in an omnichannel world. We\u2019ve also identified 6.4 million product-based businesses in the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia that could benefit from this solution. And we\u2019ll innovate with high velocity to take advantage of this market opportunity. It\u2019s still early with both QuickBooks Cash and Commerce, but we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing. Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced and the features that we\u2019re introducing to individually tailor the offering to the needs of small businesses with 10 to 100 employees at a disruptive price point. We doubled our QuickBooks Online Advanced customers to 75,000 in fiscal year 2020, and we\u2019re continuing to build on this momentum. We continue to pursue our premium app strategy and introduced integrations with Salesforce and HubSpot. We now have two of the largest CRM solutions available for our customers. And finally, our first Big Bet, revolutionize speed to benefit, enables us to put more money in our customers\u2019 pocket, to eliminate friction and deliver confidence in every touch point by using AI and customer insights. Last year, we increased use of AI and increased the number of model deployed across our platform by over 50%, tripled the speed of delivery on our modern development platform and increased mobile application deployments by 60%. We\u2019re building on this momentum this year as we innovate rapidly to solve our customers\u2019 biggest problems. Across all of our Big Bets, we\u2019re building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth into the future. We also believe the current environment continues to act as an accelerant to these bets. Most everyone is looking for virtual solutions. Small businesses are accelerating their shift to online and omnichannel commerce. And both, consumers and small businesses are looking for ways to put more money in their pockets. So, to wrap up, I\u2019m excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us. And now, let me turn it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021 : we delivered revenue of $1.3 billion; GAAP operating income of $209 million versus $10 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $334 million versus $129 million last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.75 versus $0.22 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.94 versus $0.41 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 13% during the quarter. Online Ecosystem revenue was up 24% during the quarter. Growth slowed from Q4, reflecting the lagging impact of lower retention during fiscal 2020 and the lapping of price increases, which began during the middle of Q1 last year. Additionally, Q4 included 4 points of growth from nonrecurring revenue from the Paycheck Protection Program. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Our longer term expectation remains 30% or greater Online Ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both, customers and ARPC. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 28% in fiscal Q1, driven mainly by customer growth and mix shift. We began lapping a partial quarter of a price increase last year, driving slower year-over-year growth versus last quarter. Second, we continue to focus on connecting ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital, grew 17% in fiscal Q1. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payrolls, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix shift to our full service offering and growth in payroll customers. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q1. Total international online revenue grew 51%. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 3% in the first quarter, while QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits. Desktop Ecosystem revenue growth also reflects the benefit of additional revenues from license updates and tailwinds from previously announced price increases in various products, not fully reflected in the year ago quarter. We do not expect these tailwinds to recur in future quarters. Consumer Group revenue grew 19% in Q1. Looking ahead to the upcoming tax season, we continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY, transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live and disrupt consumer finance. Turning to the ProConnect Group. Revenue grew 21% in Q1, in line with our expectations. Let me turn to our acquisition of Credit Karma. I\u2019m looking forward to welcoming the Credit Karma team to Intuit, and we\u2019re excited about the unprecedented benefits we can deliver for customers. I want to remind you that we continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive over time. However, Credit Karma\u2019s business was negatively impacted over the last seven months as lenders tightened access to credit due to economic uncertainty related to the pandemic. The business continues to recover after reaching a low point in June, with monthly revenue in October close to pre-COVID levels. Therefore, we expect the acquisition to be modestly dilutive to non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2021 and neutral to modestly dilutive to non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after close in fiscal 2022. We\u2019re looking forward to all the innovation that we can deliver together for customers. Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment, though we recognize that we may not be able to achieve them in the current environment or directly following the close of the Credit Karma transaction. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can\u2019t invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $5.8 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We expect to use approximately $3.6 billion of cash to fund part of the consideration for the Credit Karma acquisition. We did not repurchase any stock during the first quarter as we temporarily suspended share purchases in conjunction with the Credit Karma acquisition. Approximately $2.4 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market in the future. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share payable January 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. As you may have seen, we reached an agreement to settle the class action litigation regarding the IRS Free File program. We have agreed to pay $40 million to put this matter behind us. By entering into this settlement, which is subject to court approval, we\u2019re not admitting any wrongdoing. Also, as I shared at Investor Day, Intuit is the target of a law firm whose standard approach seems to involve making a demand that companies pay a settlement amount to the law firm instead of paying fees associated with arbitration. An increasing number of companies are facing similar attacks by the same law firm. We recorded approximately $10 million in arbitration fees for Q1 of fiscal 2021 and $14 million in fiscal 2020. We\u2019ll be disclosing in our 10-Q that Intuit could incur arbitration fees of approximately $400 million related to those claims in future periods. We\u2019re in the process of disputing these fees, and we believe this is an abuse of the arbitration system. If the court approves the settlement that I mentioned earlier, we believe it may significantly reduce exposure to mass arbitration claims being brought against us. Moving on to guidance. While macro uncertainty remains, we\u2019re growing more confident in how our business is performing in the current environment. Our guidance for fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 8% to 10%, GAAP earnings per share of $7 to $7.15 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.40 to $8.55. Our fiscal 2021 guidance includes 110 basis points of operating margin expansion, as we\u2019re starting to see the leverage of our platform, which I shared at Investor Day. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 23% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% for fiscal 2021. This compares to a GAAP tax rate of 17% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for fiscal 2020. These increases are driven primarily by state and IRS changes to the R&D tax credit and expected decrease to our excess tax benefits for share-based compensation. This equates to an impact of $0.53 to our GAAP earnings per share and $0.11 to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for the higher tax rate. Our Q2 fiscal 2021 guidance includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.89 to $0.92 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.34. You can find our full Q2 and fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. One final note on Q2. We\u2019re lapping a full quarter of a price increase in Q2, which we expect to negatively impact Small Business and Self-Employed revenue growth by a couple of points. Also, shortly after we close the Credit Karma acquisition, we will hold a call to discuss our revised guidance. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Michelle. Team, I\u2019m very proud of our organization and all that we\u2019ve accomplished together, and I\u2019m very optimistic about the future. So with that, let\u2019s now open it up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Ken Wong : Great. Thank you for taking my question, and a really solid start to the year, guys. When looking at the guidance, specifically the SMB guidance, one might infer that you guys have removed the W and double W macro scenarios off the table. Is that the right way to think about it, or is it just purely that your business has held up much better, and the realities are we still may run into those. But if we do, it will tilt towards this new 8% to 10% lower end? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Hey, Ken. Good to hear from you. I think, the best way I would describe it is, one, we\u2019re actually seeing how resilient our platform is and how small businesses are using our platform in this pandemic. I think to -- because of that, it just gives us confidence, as we look ahead in terms of how small businesses are going to be able to maneuver through this current environment. So, we\u2019re primarily going off of the key indicators that we see that are both,, leading and lagging, and that is really what has given us confidence to provide the guidance that we\u2019ve given. Of course, we\u2019ll have to wait and see how things play out with the health crisis and the impact of the economic crisis. But given just what we\u2019re seeing in our business, that\u2019s really what\u2019s informed our guidance that we shared today. Ken Wong : Got it. And if I could squeeze one in for Michelle. You mentioned the EBIT guidance is -- it looks like the margin expansion will be, give or take, 100, 110 basis points. And you did previously mention seeing more leverage going forward. Is this the right level of margin expansion that we should be expecting as we look ahead? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Ken. Thanks. Going to our financial principles, that really is the long-term commitment that we have and that includes growing revenue double digits and growing operating income faster than revenue. And so, we -- as I mentioned, yes, we do expect to see 110 basis points of expansion, excluding Credit Karma. As I shared at Investor Day, though, as we continue to evolve to more of an AI-driven expert platform, we do see opportunities for margin expansion across the P&L. And those opportunities can be in the areas of technology, where we\u2019re increasing the velocity of development on our actual technology platform so we can deliver faster and also using products and services across the company. We also see that in customer success, where we\u2019re scaling a common customer success platform, that drives efficiency and effectiveness serving across all products. And then, also in go-to-market, we\u2019re able to leverage a common infrastructure so that we can more effectively target customers and manage our sales and marketing processes. So, we do continue to see opportunities for us to expand margin going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. First question I was hoping to ask, I\u2019m not sure if you guys are going to comment on this, was just a current status update on your expectations on timing for Credit Karma, number one. And number two, whether all the sort of constituent pieces of Credit Karma are expected to come along because there was some speculation in the press that they might be selling off their tax business. Any chance you could comment on either of those? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Keith. Good to hear from you. First of all, we do have pretty high confidence that we will close Credit Karma by the end of calendar year. So, that\u2019s the first point. I think, the second point is, as you know, we don\u2019t comment on rumors. But, it\u2019s important to reinforce that the whole premise behind the Credit Karma acquisition was what we could do together to create a consumer finance platform, and it wasn\u2019t for the tax business. And so, I think, I will just leave it at that. But nevertheless, we\u2019re really excited and can\u2019t wait to close this, so we can start doing amazing things together for consumers. Keith Weiss : Got it. If I could maybe sneak one last one since that last one is like half of the answer. In the broader platform within SMB, when you\u2019re going into stuff like cash, when you\u2019re trying to do more of the commerce back-end, how is this changing your competitive environment? Have you seen a significant sort of change in kind of who you\u2019re going up against or sort of how you have to position the solutions for these newer solutions? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Hey Keith, thanks for calling me out, buddy. In terms of your question, it\u2019s interesting timing. We had QuickBooks Connect yesterday, which is where we have thousands of small businesses and accountants and partners together. And of course, this one was far, far bigger than it ever has been because it was all virtual. And we rolled out a lot of our innovation. But particularly, to answer your question, we also rolled out QuickBooks Commerce and QuickBooks Cash to our customer base or at least gave visibility and awareness. And the feedback was just through the roof. Because if I start with accountants, accountants were very excited because now they can recommend QuickBooks to product-based businesses, and they love how QuickBooks Commerce works for product-based businesses, and they love the fact that they can, in essence, help a small business run their business through the platform. And two small businesses that were product-based businesses, they love Commerce, and by the way, we got raving reviews on QuickBooks Cash, and it\u2019s just a simple app where you can send and receive money to be able to run your business. And so, I would say from a positioning standpoint, we\u2019re not doing anything differently in terms of going up against others. What we\u2019re really focused on is the customer problem and how we\u2019re raising awareness. And in fact, our team has done some great work in the months and the year ahead, what you\u2019ll see is we\u2019ll be, in essence, going to market with digital assets that helps small businesses understand that we can truly be the source of truth for their entire business versus the source of truth for their books and from an accounting lens. And so, it\u2019s more about what we\u2019re doing to raise awareness and shape the market versus doing anything differently, given who we\u2019re going up against because it\u2019s, frankly no different than what it\u2019s been in the past. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of WF Securities. Michael Turrin : On guidance and the decision to bring that back, obviously, the bigger focus now is on Small Business. But looking ahead to tax, I mean, you\u2019ve previously mentioned tough comps from the strong top-of-funnel activity you saw last year, still guiding for 9% to 10% growth as a starting point there this year. Can you just help maybe frame out the base case there and maybe your confidence around ability to further monetize that uptick you saw this past year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Michael. Very good to hear from you. First of all, as we talked about last quarter, our biggest uncertainty was around the macro environment and the impact to small businesses and how our platform would perform in the times of uncertainty. So, we\u2019ve just learned a ton. One, all the credit to small businesses in terms of just their passion to do whatever it takes to survive; but then two, us better understanding how they use the platform to be able to deliver for customers. And so, given that and given that we started experiencing businesses opening across the Company and our confidence is at an improved level than it was a quarter ago. With that said, to your question around tax, we\u2019re bullish about our strategy, and we\u2019ve continued to be bullish based on the results that we\u2019re seeing. And particularly, it\u2019s driven by two primary areas. One, it\u2019s who we focus on; and then, the second is the how. So, who we focus on is, we\u2019ve doubled down several years ago on serving investors, serving self-employed and serving the Latinx market, all of which we are underpenetrated. And then, two, really going after the market, the assisted market, and those that are looking for more confidence with TurboTax Live. And so, although our comps compared to last year are tough comps, we do have confidence in our execution, our trajectory. And that\u2019s really what informed the guidance that we provided. Michael Turrin : Got it. That\u2019s all clear. Certainly a nice start to the year. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Jennifer Lowe : I wanted to drill down on the international growth because of the 51% was a pretty impressive number. And I think at Analyst Day, you exited fiscal \u201820 with around 14% growth in subs. Obviously pricing has been a pretty strong lever. So, can you just maybe break down or sort of decompose the components of that 51% growth? How much of that is potentially an improvement in the subscriber count that you\u2019re seeing there versus just continued success on pricing initiatives? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Hi, Jennifer. Good to hear from you. It\u2019s both. Very consistent with what we shared at Investor Day. We continue to see strength in the UK and Canada. And we\u2019re seeing some of the emerging markets that we\u2019re focused on, like Brazil and France, really start their acceleration even in this current environment. And so, really, it\u2019s a combination of being very-focused on who we pursue with what products we pursue and then also really intentional about pricing, and frankly, a lot less discounting, especially in places like Canada and UK, where we created a network effect with small businesses using us, recommending us, with accountants using us and recommending us. And so, we don\u2019t have to discount as much to get our name known. So, it\u2019s very similar to what we talked about, which is it\u2019s a combination of customer growth and ARPC growth. And the ARPC growth is a lot to do with what we\u2019re selling and a lot less discounting. Jennifer Lowe : Great. And maybe just one more for me. So, a little while ago over the summer as the world was changing with COVID-19, you, like many other companies, took some actions to sort of deemphasize some of the less growthy businesses and then plan to bring back the head count over time in some of the growthier parts of the business. I\u2019m just curious where you are in that process at this point. And maybe specific to the margin guidance, what\u2019s the assumption on the pace of getting back into the hiring groove on your business and cost structure? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure. Just for a quick context, there are a couple of areas where we felt like we needed to double down in context of the bets that we\u2019ve declared. It\u2019s the type of talent that we\u2019re pursuing, both in creating a modern operations and our customer success, but also the type of experts that we want to bring into customer success. And then, in technology, it was more systems engineers, infrastructure engineers, cloud engineers that have lots of experience in building complex systems in the cloud. And we are aggressively hiring in those areas because they ultimately are very important in serving the bets that I talked about earlier and a lot of our innovation, we\u2019ve been talking about like commerce, cash advance, et cetera. So, we feel good about our hiring ramp. And I think, I would just really focus on the guidance that Michelle talked about, which includes about 110 basis points of margin expansion. And all of our approach to hiring is all embedded in the guidance that we provided. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Sterling Auty : Just one question from my side. You talked about the headwind from renewal rates from previous quarter impacted this quarter\u2019s revenue. Can you just give us an update, what did you see in terms of renewal rates through this quarter in the Small Business franchise? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. They\u2019re actually the tailwinds -- or the headwinds are in three buckets. One is, overall, as we shared at Investor Day, our retention dropped by a couple of points based on what we saw in the March, April, May timeframe. That, along with lapping a price increase and actually not taking price action deliberately, plus the impact from acquisitions in those same months, is really what impacted our growth rate for the quarter that you see here. And our view is, effective the second quarter will be probably the lowest point of the year for the Small Business Group for the same exact reasons that I just mentioned. As you know, we don\u2019t break out quarterly attrition and retention rates. We share once a year at Investor Day. So, those are the main drivers of it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Brent Thill : Sasan, if you could just talk about the shape of the recovery in SMB that you\u2019re seeing and the conviction level you have that that continues. Can you just give us a sense of how you\u2019re seeing that progress? And then, I just had a quick follow-up. You were showing the TurboTax full opportunity set on your website. You removed it. It seems really interesting in terms of the opportunity to outsource everything to you. Can you just walk through your intentions for that solution this year? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Brent. Good to hear from you. In terms of the shape of the recovery, it\u2019s actually quite consistent with what we shared at Investor Day. May -- most of our indicators are back to pre-pandemic levels, but charge volume is still several points lower. The number of companies running payroll is still several points lower. So although things have recovered, the reality is things are still below pre-pandemic levels. I think, where we have more confidence, Brent, is now we are actually seeing how our platform is -- really how resilient it is and how it\u2019s delivering benefits for customers in these very tough times, plus the innovation that we have across the platform. So, just seeing how our platform is playing out and seeing the impact of our innovation is actually what gives us even more confidence. And from a recovery standpoint, not much has changed in the last six weeks and what we shared at Investor Day. To turn to your second question, we\u2019re actually -- when you think about transforming the assisted segment and really helping customers do their taxes with confidence, there are those that choose to do it themselves. But, at one point in time, they may want to hit a button and get an expert to come, talk to them, review their return to gain confidence. So, those that from the beginning may choose to have help along the way and pick TurboTax Live as an actual offering right off the bat. And then, there are those that may start and decide, you know what, I just want you to do my taxes for me, which is a lot of what we were testing in the last several months. And our plan is to actually launch the platform with all of those capabilities come -- this coming tax season, which by the way is right around the corner. Operator : Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Siti Panigrahi : I just want to ask about trends you are seeing in terms of new customer acquisition. Because we saw this recent Q3 data, census data, there\u2019s a record number of small business creation, in Q3, I think, 1.6 million versus average of 800,000. So, I guess most of these could be potentially QuickBooks customer. So, how should we think about this opportunity and the current trend of this new customer acquisition? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Siti, good to hear from you, and a really good question. As I mentioned, there are a few of our key metrics that have recovered quite nicely, but they\u2019re still below the pre-COVID levels like charge volume and payroll. Acquisition is one that\u2019s actually rebounded quite nicely, and we\u2019re actually benefiting from some of what you shared, which is more new business formation. So, that\u2019s probably a metric above and beyond all of them that is probably more in the green, and we\u2019re benefiting from some of that recovery. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Yaoxian Chew : Hi, everyone. This is Yao on for Brad. Thanks for my taking my question. It\u2019s a little bit specific but also philosophical here, and it\u2019s around QuickBooks Commerce and the specific topic of discounting. I understand it\u2019s a new solution, and you want mass market adoption, but when I go to the website, it shows 92% of monthly list price for the first 12 months of service. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that in software before. I guess, what\u2019s the thought process here, especially as it sounds like you\u2019re being more thoughtful around optimizing for discounts in other areas of your business? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Yao, good to hear from me and very good question. Two things I would say. One is, we are actually very intentionally qualifying customers on top of the funnel to ensure that we only bring in customers that we can deliver against their expectations, given just we literally just launched the platform. Interesting enough, one thing that we\u2019re seeing is customers want to use it so bad, they go back to the top of the funnel and change their answers, so they can qualify for it. So, the demand is quite high. I think, you may have fallen into one of our test cells. There\u2019s a lot of different things that we\u2019re testing, different business models, different pricing. So, I don\u2019t know exactly what you fell into, but it sounds like you fell into a test cell. Yaoxian Chew : Got it. The other bit I guess around the 9% to 10% -- I\u2019m sorry, the QuickBooks and Small Business growth scenario there. Just thinking about exogenous factors that may result in upside or downside, does -- a hypothetical government stimulus package, how does that help churn or business creation and how to think about that flowing through to your model? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. The stimulus, I would say, no pun intended, is not really going to be a big stimulus for small businesses. It\u2019s not going to make a difference between them going out of business or not. I\u2019ll hit on one element of your question, which is the range of the guidance. The low end of the guidance is really driven from how restrictive the states becomes, how restrictive the country becomes beyond what we\u2019re all seeing, which is you now no longer -- although every x state is a little different, you no longer can go into a fitness center, it\u2019s only if it\u2019s outside. You can\u2019t go eat inside at all. Now schools like the New York public schools just closed again. So, everybody has to go from home. That has implications to the local economy. So, the low end of the guidance is more how restrictive things get and then the impact on small businesses, because we feel quite confident in our execution. And of course, the high end is the -- I would say the trends that we\u2019re experiencing and seeing right now. That\u2019s how we thought about it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani of Piper Sandler. Arvind Ramnani : I just wanted to -- one of the tone changes I picked up at your recent Analyst Day was kind of really focusing on increasing revenue per customer. I just want to see if that was kind of something that you are looking to do to really increase revenue per customer, and how you\u2019re planning to approach it over the next couple of years. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Arvind, good to hear from you. Let me just play back to your question because you were cutting in and out. I want to make sure I\u2019m answering the question that you\u2019re asking. I think, your question was, we talked about revenue per customer increasing at Investor Day, and you were just wondering how we plan to achieve that. Did I play that back correctly? Arvind Ramnani : Yes. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. I would say a couple of uber messages. The first one is, it\u2019s because of the incredible innovation and the acceleration of the innovation from the team that\u2019s really going after delivering benefits that that customers care about most. So, if I decompose that with a couple of examples, what I would share is, QuickBooks Live is -- has the potential to increase revenue per customer. The volume is not, of course, at the same rate, but the revenue per customer is. When you look at QuickBooks Advanced, which comes with it serving much larger customers, that has an opportunity and does move the needle when it comes to revenue per customer. And then, there\u2019s the services, the services that go with QuickBooks Live, the services that go with QuickBooks Advanced.  And then, within all the services that we provide, payments, payroll, TSheets and now with the integration of TSheets and Payroll Full Service, these services and the innovation and the impact themselves also deliver more revenue per customer. So, when you put all of those together, those are the biggest drivers of increased revenue per customer, which is just driven by the innovation that the team is delivering for customers. Arvind Ramnani : Great, terrific. And just a quick second question for me. How transformative is your relatively new integrated CRM solution? Should we expect this to be a big revenue growth driver, or is it just another proof point of differentiated offering? Sasan Goodarzi : I think, it\u2019s just another important innovation and benefit for customers on our QuickBooks Advanced platform. Again, when you think about these customers -- because I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about like HubSpot and Salesforce. And these customers that are between 10 to 100 employees, and even larger than that. They are looking for CRM solutions. So, we invested quite a bit of time with, I\u2019ll use HubSpot as an example, to really deeply integrate. In fact, I was reviewing the demo several days ago, and it\u2019s a really cool experience for our customers. So, this is -- it just positions us and allows us to not only serve our existing customers with QuickBooks Advanced, but also penetrate and get new customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : I was hoping, Sasan or Michelle, if you could elaborate please on the mix shift driving in QuickBooks Online accounting. If you could delve in a little deeper, primary drivers and sustainability you foresee there. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, Scott. I\u2019ll jump in, and if there\u2019s anything Michelle wants that she can jump in. It\u2019s very similar to what I just shared with Arvind. First of all, I\u2019ll start with the headline that it\u2019s very sustainable. We\u2019re just getting started. And when you look at the mix that gets driven by the platform with QuickBooks Live, it gets -- another one is QuickBooks Advanced. And both of these come with them services, like payments and payroll and TSheets, and then apps like HubSpot, as an example, that allows us to drive a mix shift. And so, those are just examples. And then, QuickBooks Commerce, which really gives us the opportunity to serve product-based businesses that we served for years in desktop, the million product-based services that we have on desktop. Now we have an opportunity to serve these customers with QuickBooks Commerce. So, those are the drivers. And then, the last one I would say is countries where we get the product market fit, like Canada and UK, we have an opportunity to expand the services that we provide and at higher prices and don\u2019t have to discount as much because our names are out there, the experience goes viral, and therefore, more customers want to use it. So, those are the drivers of the mix shift and the ARPC shift, and that\u2019s quite durable. Scott Schneeberger : And then, as a follow-up, I\u2019m just curious, just from view points on Small Business failures. Obviously, you feel confident enough to give guidance and we\u2019ve heard a lot of good things in discussion of stimulus as well. But, just anecdotally, what are some of the things that you\u2019re seeing, and do you feel that the economy is around the corner, to the extent you can speak for that? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Two things I would say. I think, the most important lever for small businesses is we got to lead thoughtfully through this health crisis, because leading thoughtfully through the health crisis will enable the country and the globe to actually bring jobs back and reduce unemployment. Those are the two largest levers that will impact Small Business failures. And as we talked about at Investor Day, our retention dropped a couple of points because of the failures that we experienced. I think, those two levers that I mentioned, plus a fiscal stimulus, not just more stimulus money but a fiscal stimulus, along with getting out of this health crisis, and ultimately, getting back to lower unemployment is going to really drive the long-term health of small businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. Kirk Materne : Sasan, I was wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper into the sort of announcement today of HubSpot. And maybe just your view on whether or not small businesses are now looking a little bit more for a one-stop shop. I mean, you guys obviously have financials, you added commerce, and this obviously expands you into CRM and marketing with them. So, is the feedback that you\u2019ve been getting that this is, look we want to only to let one vendor to really help us manage our business from customer acquisition through finances, through commerce. I mean, because that\u2019s what it sort of seems like. And do you think the market is moving there in a faster way due to COVID? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. You\u2019re very welcome. I would focus more on the customer pain that we are after. One of the things that we\u2019re really focused on is, one, to help our customers grow; and two, to be able to serve product-based businesses. Because even in service-based businesses, traditionally, we\u2019ve not solved the problem of helping them grow and get more customers well. And so, this integration with HubSpot, with Salesforce is really an example of solving the problem of -- with our platform, we can help you grow your business. We can help you get paid. We can help you do payroll. We can give you access to capital. We can help you with time tracking. Of course, now we can help you set up on multiple different channels and be able to run your product-based business. So, we\u2019re really focused on the customer problem. And one of the things, I preach probably more than that ward wants to hear it at Intuit is, let\u2019s not focus on just creating a one-stop shop because that\u2019s not how a customer think. The customer thinks, I need to solve my problem. Can you solve it for me? With that said, we are seeing more and more customers begin to use our platform to be able to run their business. And we\u2019re seeing more and more customers tell us, hey, can you do some integrations with the following applications to be able to help me grow my business? So, those are the -- it\u2019s very customer-back-driven. And it\u2019s now several years of us being in the cloud where we\u2019re building out the platform to the point where you don\u2019t need to go anywhere else. You can run your entire business on our platform, which is exactly the same thing we\u2019re looking to do on the consumer side. We want a consumer platform where you can do your taxes, get early access to your paycheck, connect the financial products that are right for you and truly reach financial freedom. And so, it really is -- it\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re trying to do across the Company for customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Sasan, you\u2019ve talked about QuickBooks business and not raising prices, obviously considering the economic environment we\u2019re in. Do you think that same philosophy will apply to the tax business, or is the tax business different? And do you think there\u2019s some different leverage points and price would be available for the upcoming season? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Kartik, good to hear from you. I would think about this in a couple of dimensions. Both, [Technical Difficulty] and small businesses, we actually now have offerings that are disruptive, and they disrupt higher-priced alternatives. So, when you look at QuickBooks Live, the price that customers have to pay with QuickBooks Live is actually a lot less than what they pay with if they have to go directly and find their own bookkeeper or enrolled agent. And you look at QuickBooks Advanced, we are actually at a disruptive price but yet have a lot of opportunity in terms of what we can do with pricing. Same thing goes for TurboTax Live, where a much lower cost alternative than going to somebody\u2019s home or store to get your taxes done. So, I think the way I would think about it is, there are segments of customers we may intentionally, given the environment, not do price increases, but then there are certain segments of the customers where we will because we\u2019re actually very disruptive and far lower price alternative. So, that\u2019s the way we approach it and think about it internally. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs. Chris Merwin : I think, you all talked about the Online Ecosystem getting back to 30% growth over time. And I guess, if we look at the \u201821 guidance for the segment as a whole and we assume desktop is flat, I think, it wouldn\u2019t buy that QuickBooks Online would be maybe high-teens growth for this coming year. It sounds like the trends are very much getting back on track for QuickBooks Online. So, just curious how we think about the progression back towards 30%-plus growth over time for that segment. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Chris. First of all, as you heard Michelle mention, we have every intention over time to get to back to 30%-plus online revenue growth. And that will happen really by two levers. One is, our continued innovation to deliver value and the portfolio we now have; and two, it\u2019s the recovery of small businesses. Although our platform has demonstrated to be resilient, it\u2019s important to know that we\u2019re not out of this pandemic. And we need to make sure that we get through this health crisis and get unemployment back down and get to a more healthy economy. And I think, the combination of our innovation and getting to a better place in terms of the economy will allow us to get back to that 30%. And a lot of that is what informs the guidance that we provided. Chris Merwin : Okay, great. Thank you. And then, maybe one just quick follow-up. I wanted to ask about QuickBooks Advanced just in terms of how that\u2019s doing relative to your expectations in the current environment. Are you seeing customers holding back on some of the larger system upgrades, say, relative to SMB? I mean -- or is that not the case? Just curious how you\u2019d characterize the strength you\u2019re seeing in that business right now. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. I would say it\u2019s actually doing well. At Investor Day, if you recall, we talked about now we have 75,000 customers, and that\u2019s 100% growth year-over-year. And we\u2019re seeing both, customers upgrade to QuickBooks Advanced that are existing customers, and we\u2019re actually seeing new customers come in that have been using a bunch of different apps and manual processes. And they use QuickBooks Advanced, and they see it as an advantage to be able to grow their business. So, we\u2019re actually -- and because it\u2019s disruptive in terms of price versus alternatives, we are not seeing any holdbacks. And we\u2019re actually seeing the benefit of what a platform can do that\u2019s a disruptor, especially those small businesses that are deciding, you know what, me manually running my business is no longer going to work. I need to move to the cloud, especially because of the COVID environment. And QuickBooks Advanced becomes an accelerant. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Michael Millman : So, if I\u2019ve done the numbers roughly correct, there\u2019s about 100 million taxpayers who pay about $0.25 trillion, that\u2019s -- was a T like TurboTax dollars, for no or zero return. Just kind of wondering with this kind of opportunity maybe for you, what if anything you\u2019re doing now to get some of this money funneled into something that\u2019s earning or Karma Credit -- Credit Karma doing anything? Does the IRS kind of stand up there and say, don\u2019t you dare fool with all this money? Maybe you can help us think about this. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, Michael. Let me take a shot at this to see if this addresses your question. First of all, we do see a very large opportunity. But, the way we look at it is that there are about 86 million people that go to somebody else to have their taxes done. And they spend about $20 billion or more to get those taxes done. We just see a huge opportunity to be able to serve those customers with a digital platform where we can bring the help to their place of home or office at their convenience at a much lower price and provide them the confidence that they need to get the maximum refund. So, we do see the same opportunity that you do. Our figures are a bit different than what you were articulating, but that\u2019s really what we are pursuing with our Live platform. Michael Millman : I was actually kind of thinking of no refund. Don\u2019t pay more than you need to. Invest that money. Sasan Goodarzi : Oh, got you. I think, I understand what you\u2019re asking. The whole purpose of our vision of what we want to do to create a consumer finance platform is to give consumers choice. It\u2019s to give them choice to connect to financial products like loans and insurance and credit cards that are right for them. It\u2019s to be able to give them choice when they get their tax refund, if they want to put it in a high-yield savings account, if they want early access to their tax refund, and so actually want early access to their paycheck. To give them more choice because we have the ability with using their data with their permission to give them insights that otherwise they wouldn\u2019t get. Plus, by the way, if they wanted an expert to help them, will provide some advice, we can also help them with that. That\u2019s our vision of what we want to -- what we want to do with our Big Bet three, which is unlock smart money decisions. And of course, that\u2019s where Credit Karma comes in and can really fuel that vision. And we\u2019re excited about it. Michael Millman : So, you\u2019re thinking more of after tax payers get a refund, rather than saying you shouldn\u2019t -- there shouldn\u2019t be a refund. You should be using that money more productively than lending it to the IRS? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Well, the refund of the consumers\u2019 money. So, what we\u2019re -- it\u2019s money that\u2019s theirs and they earned it and they should get their refund. It\u2019s about how we help the consumer with what they can do with their refund is really our mission. Michael Millman : I see. Okay. And just quickly, the guidance you gave that is before Credit Karma, or does that include Credit Karma? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. That is excluding Credit Karma, because we have not yet closed Credit Karma. And as Michelle mentioned, once we do close Credit Karma, we will actually have another call. And we will update our guidance and it will include Credit Karma. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019m not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. I\u2019ll be brief. Thank you everyone for your questions. And wish everyone that celebrates Thanksgiving a wonderful and safe Thanksgiving. And we\u2019ll speak to you very soon. And enjoy your holidays. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Latif and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2021 conference call. I\u2019m here with Intuit's CEO Sasan Goodarzi and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2020 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Second quarter results reflect strong momentum across the company. Small Business and Self-Employed Group grew double digits. Credit Karma performed very well and we are encouraged by our early results this tax season. We are on track for Intuit to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth. We are confident our game plan to win is durable, accelerated by digital tailwinds given the pandemic. Our platform is well positioned to help customers take advantage of a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omni-channel capabilities, and new ways to reduce debt and save money. The velocity of our innovation is helping our customers at a time when they need us most, and positions us to accelerate growth in light of these structural and behavioral changes. We closed the acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3rd, and welcomed 1,300 Credit Karma employees to the Intuit family. We bring together a large customer base of 110 million Credit Karma members and 57 million Intuit customers to help them unlock smart money decisions. Credit Karma\u2019s data platform creates powerful network effects through personalized financial offers \u2013 benefitting members and partners \u2013 while adding a new monetization engine to Intuit. We are off and running executing on our innovation roadmap which I will touch on shortly. Since we\u2019re in the middle of tax season, let\u2019s start there. We are very confident in our strategy and momentum extending our lead in the Do-It-Yourself category and transforming the assisted segment. We are making great progress serving fast growing underpenetrated Latinx, self-employed and investor segments. This season, we also expanded our free eligibility to better serve customers receiving unemployment benefits. We continue to aggressively transform the assisted segment by reshaping how 86 million filers can get their maximum refund with confidence virtually. We feel great about how the season is progressing. Let me now shift to our Big Bets. We are seeing strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the business with our AI-driven expert platform strategy and five Big Bets. These Big Bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face, and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. I will highlight our progress, covering Big Bet number one last as it accelerates innovation across our platform and is foundational to the other bets. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We are solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we are transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing the 86 million filers, the opportunity to access tax experts on our platform. We continue to lead the way in shaping the category, helping customers understand how they can get their taxes done in a new way with our marketing campaigns and for a limited time, offering free Live expertise to filers with very simple returns to attract them into the category. We have significantly improved the TurboTax Live platform by making it easier for customers to access an expert throughout the filing experience, and now with our innovative full service offering, our customers can hand-off their return to an expert who will prepare it and file it for them. We continue to make progress with QuickBooks Live, which is built on the same expert platform. Entering our second peak season with QuickBooks Live, our customer base has doubled from a year ago and retention rates are improving. Although it\u2019s early days for QuickBooks Live, we are confident in the long-term opportunity to penetrate non-consumption. Our third big bet is to unlock smart money decisions. We are making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, puts more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. Our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans and insurance; and develop emerging verticals, focused on money innovation, including savings and checking accounts. As we make personalized financial offers to customers across our platform, Credit Karma provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. We\u2019ve made great initial progress combining our capabilities to fuel success of the Credit Karma platform. First, to create a complete financial profile for existing and prospective members, with customer consent, we combined income data from 26 million TurboTax returns with Credit Karma. The combination of verified income data with credit history will enable Credit Karma to better personalize offers, driving engagement and creating a win-win-win for our members, partners and us over time. This enables us to grow in our core verticals for credit cards and personal loans and growth verticals for insurance and mortgages. Second, we integrated Credit Karma Money into the TurboTax filing experience, providing approximately 36 million TurboTax customers ability to deposit up to $88 billion of tax refunds into a no-fee checking account. And third, we are migrating Turbo users to Credit Karma. We are excited about the journey ahead of us. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we are innovating with velocity to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. We are making it even easier for customers to get paid fast with tools like payment-enabled invoices, by auto-enabling new customers to accept payments immediately, increasing our charge volume. We continue to innovate with QuickBooks Cash, a small business bank account that helps our customers manage working capital by providing visibility into their full financial picture, along with the ability to move money instantly and ensure their money is working for them. Now taking advantage of the built-in accounting of QuickBooks, we integrated Bill Pay into the offering this quarter. We are seeing growing adoption and active use of QuickBooks Cash, including a meaningful increase in activation rates. We are making good progress with QuickBooks Commerce, launched last September. QuickBooks Commerce is designed to better serve the 1 million product-based businesses on our platform and 6.4 million product-based businesses in our core markets. The offering provides inventory and order management tools small businesses need to grow their businesses in an omnichannel world. We continue to add new partner integrations, enabling a streamlined experience. We\u2019re further bolstering the offering with the acquisition of OneSaas in early February. OneSaas is an infrastructure platform that integrates data streams from multiple sources of e-commerce platforms. This will help our customers see a complete view in QuickBooks. It\u2019s still early for both QuickBooks Cash and QuickBooks Commerce, but we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. The features we are introducing individually tailor the offering to the needs of small businesses with 10 to 100 employees at a disruptive price point. We continue to build out the offering and innovate to better serve these mid-market small business customers, by adding more deeply integrated partners, important to both acquisition and retention. And finally, our first big bet, revolutionize speed to benefit, enables us to put more money in our customers\u2019 pockets, eliminate friction and deliver confidence at every touch point by using AI and customer insights. In TurboTax, we\u2019re leveraging advanced models to proactively offer customers the right resources at the right time to keep them engaged and give them confidence to file their taxes. And in QuickBooks Advanced, we\u2019re using AI to detect anomalies in price and quantity on customer invoices, saving our customers time and the frustration of having to resend an invoice. Our Live offerings are benefiting from a common AI platform that is creating efficiencies at scale, driving profitable growth. Across all of our big bets, we are building momentum and accelerating innovation which we believe positions us well for durable growth into the future. I\u2019m excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us, and I\u2019m proud of the progress we are making as a team. Now let me hand it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $1.6 billion, GAAP operating loss of $25 million versus operating income of $270 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $235 million versus $384 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.07, versus $0.91 a year ago. The GAAP earnings include a $30 million gain from the sale of a note receivable that was previously written off and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.68, versus $1.16 last year. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue declined 71% in Q2, driven by the later IRS opening this year. We continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. We remain confident in our plans and guidance of 9% to 10% growth in fiscal 2021. Turning to the ProConnect Group, revenue declined 8% in Q2, reflecting a delay in forms availability. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 11% during the quarter, while Online Ecosystem revenue was up 22%. Our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. Our longer-term expectation remains 30% or greater online ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both customers and ARPC. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 22% in fiscal Q2, driven mainly by customer growth and mix-shift. We lapped a full quarter of a price increase last year, driving slower year-over-year growth versus last quarter. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital grew 20% in fiscal Q2. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix-shift to our full service offering and growth in payroll customers. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q2. Total international online revenue grew 44%. The slower growth from last quarter was driven by lapping price increases a year ago, and the lingering impact from lower retention and customer acquisition at the beginning of the pandemic. Desktop Ecosystem revenue declined 2% in the second quarter, inline with our expectations for the business to decline longer-term. Within this, QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits. Small businesses are resilient, and we continue to help them put more money in their pockets when they need it most. We are pleased to see most QuickBooks indicators are back to or better than pre-pandemic levels. This includes growth in customer acquisition, the number of companies running payroll and payments charge volume. This reinforces the digital tailwinds and positioning of our platform and Big Bets Sasan touched on earlier. We closed the acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3rd, resulting in revenue of $144 million for the partial quarter. Our strategic focus with Credit Karma is to grow the core of credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals such as home loans, auto loans and insurance; and develop emerging verticals, focused on money innovation including savings and checking accounts. I\u2019ll share more detail on each of these strategic focus areas. First, our focus is growing the core. We are seeing new credit card and personal loan partners onboarding while overall partner activity continues to recover. Adoption of the industry-first Lightbox continues to grow. Lightbox enables Credit Karma to more tightly integrate with its financial partners which helps match members to the products that are right for them. This now represents approximately 40% of credit card transactions and approximately 30% of personal loan transactions, up substantially year-over-year. Second, our focus is expanding growth verticals. Although it's early days, we're seeing strong growth in auto insurance followed by home loans and then auto loans, January revenue in the growth vertical is up over 1.5 times year-over-year, it's a high watermark. During the quarter, we introduced Karma Drive providing members an easy opportunity to qualify for an auto insurance discount based on actual driving habits. Third, our focus is developing emerging verticals, particularly money innovation, and we're just getting started with Credit Karma money. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue, double-digits and growing, operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we're starting to see the opportunity for faster margin expansion over time. And I'm proud of the progress that team is making. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate and opportunities that yield an expected return on investments greater than 15%. We continue to focus on reallocating resources to top priorities, with an emphasis of becoming an AI driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment. Our first priorities at cash regenerate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we repurchased $175 million of stock during the second quarter. We have approximately $2.2 billion remaining on our authorization and we expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share payable April 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, while macro uncertainty continues, we remain confident in how our business is performing in the current environment. Our guidance for third quarter fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 53% to 55%, GAAP earnings per share of $5.85 to $5.95 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.75 $6.85. You can find our full Q3 and reiterated fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great, thanks Michelle. I'm very proud of our team and all we've accomplished together and I'm very optimistic about the future. So with that said, let's now open it up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much, good afternoon. I'm going to ask on tax since we're in that season. And I'm just very curious on, if you're seeing any activity pick up from all the new brokerage accounts opened in 2020, if you're seeing a lot of activity in your Tops business from corresponding tax reporting from that. And just Sasan, a few thoughts on that, is that going to trigger more volume or do you think it's more likely something that will trigger an increase in the revenue per return since such transactions might come in at a higher tier of offering. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you for your question, Scott. If I would take you back to what we declared several years ago, one element was under-penetrated segments. The investment community was one, of course Self-Employed and Latinx. And the other element of course is about transforming the assistant segment, which also helps us serve that community. Well, if they need expertise or if they want us to do their taxes for them. And what I would tell you, we all see the same stats, there is then really a significant increase in retail investors using all the different tools that are out there and not just in the United States, but particularly in Brazil, India, and the U.S. And, so I feel good that we're very well positioned. And all of those segments that I mentioned, Latinx Self-Employed and Premier, we are actually experiencing the kind of growth that we expected and probably, a kick-up on our Premier offering, which really serves our investment community. So we are experiencing an accelerated growth and it's really all sort of in context of what we had declared, and we'll have to see how the season plays out when we tally up our results, what it all looks like, but we're very, very pleased with the fact that we really positioned ourselves to serve the segment a few years ago. And I think we're positioned well for delivering for them this season, both with live platform and if you want to do it yourself. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. I appreciate that, Sasan. And then staying on taxes, I'm just curious, kind of a high-level question, and you get this throughout the preseason, but now we're into the tax season. What type of February returns do you expect this year versus last year? I saw recently that Texas, because of what's gone on there in the last couple of weeks has gotten into way to June 25. So with that into account, and then just the warm tax season last year a condense for most States tax season this year, what are you expecting just for an industry growth year-over-year and anything that you're seeing in the early season to support that view? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. A couple of things, I would say, one, the assumptions that we made coming into this tax season is that IRS returns would be sort of flattish and we expect to be able to grow our share of the total number of returns, and particularly because of our focus on the under-penetrated segments that I mentioned and transforming the assistance segment with our live platforms, really for us, it's about growing our share of the entire category and as, we have such a massive opportunity with $86 million filers that today go to somebody else to do their taxes. And the fact that we have an opportunity to help them get their taxes on with the expert at their fingertips with any time that they needed. So really our role is about growing the category and in context of a flattish IRS returns. All of our guidance, just \u2013 we made the assumption that is April 15 finished, we contemplated the Taxes announcement that was made yesterday, we\u2019re really just looking at past situations where there is been a disaster where IRS has extended the filing date. The behaviors are very different net-net, we feel very good about our progress, we feel very good about our momentum and really good about the potential that we have this season and the context of the guidance that we provided. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your question, please. Ken Wong : Great. Thank you for taking my question. The first one for you Sasan also on tax, as you think about TurboTax full service, I\u2019m not sure if you guys are starting to see some good traction there, but we'd love to get a sense of what kind of customers you're seeing, utilize that particular product, is it guys coming from accountants? Is it kind of net new filers who may have the greatest level of uncertainty? Is this across the board? Any color you can give would be fantastic. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, Ken. Good to hear from you. It's important just to remind ourselves that we're \u2013 in the assistant segment, the biggest problem that we're solving is competence. These $86 million filers need to know that they can ask a question from an expert at any time that they need to and have the ability to turn over their return if they so choose. And we are getting very good traction with full service, but it really plays, I would say, a Halo effect. What customers want to know is that, they can come in and if they choose to ask for help that they can get it, and somewhere in the experience, if they choose to just say here, let me give you all of my documents digitally that we can do it for them, or even if they choose to make that choice upfront. So full service beyond the actual number of customers that will end up using full service really is playing a Halo effect, which is what we learned in our test results last year, it really builds confidence for filers that are coming from the assisted category that I can get my questions answered, there's always going to be an expert at my side. And as a reminder last year, we experienced 70%-plus growth in TurboTax Live, and a majority of those customers actually came from the assisted category. So it's playing the role exactly as we had assumed that it would. And so far so good this season in terms of the traction that we\u2019re getting. Ken Wong : Great, great. That's super helpful. And then a quick one for you, Michelle. You touched on Lightbox and seeing I think 40% of transaction, 30% of personal loans. Just wondering kind of where do you think those numbers could trend up to? And then as far as monetization, any color on kind of how monetization has improved for customers that are utilizing Lightbox? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hey, Ken, thanks for the question here. Lightbox is a great technology that really is \u2013 enables us to have a winning experience for both the customer and for our partners, our financial institution partners, as well as us. There is nothing more frustrating than for a customer to come in and not be able to get access to a financial product that they thought they would. And so, it enables the financial institutions to be able to better target the products that they have and then customers are much more likely to actually be approved. So with the metrics that we have right now, we'll have to see how those trends over time, we're very excited about it, we want to continue to have more and more transactions go through Lightbox, because as we said, it's a better experience for the customer and it also is a better experience for our partners. Ken Wong : Great. Thanks, Michelle. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Sasan, we heard from Michelle's comments that many of the small business indicators, such as customer acquisition, number of companies running payroll, payments, charge, volumes, things like that are all trending positively. Can you maybe expand it a little bit more on the indicators that they're looking at in terms of small business health and from your perspective kind of where we are in terms of small business recovery? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure. Let me start Brad with the actual recovery, depending on the geography United States versus UK or different States within the U.S., every geography is performing differently. And just to use an example, we've got places like Florida, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, but have actually recovered quite nicely. And then you have places like Michigan and Washington, California and New York that are lagging. And then within that, you have industries that have come back all the way and industries that haven't. It\u2019s the natural ones that you would assume, it's fitness, restaurants, travel. I\u2019d bring that up in context of yet another data point, which is when we look across the data points that we see about a 25% of our customers, their net dollars in their bank account is down nearly 50%. So I give you those data points just to say that small businesses are still working hard to come back to where they were, and they're not all the way back. That's really important context relative to how our trends are doing. And what you heard from Michelle, which is, we watch acquisition, we watch retention, of course we watch our payments charge volume, the number of companies running payroll, the number of employees per company using payroll time tracking et cetera. And all of those indicators are at or above pre-COVID levels except the number of employees at small businesses. And that really tells you a lot about just the innovation that's happening on our platform, the power of our platform, and the fact that in times where small businesses are actually doing worse than they were prior to COVID are actually platform metrics are at or better than pre-COVID. And so that actually really bodes well for us to not only deliver for our customers, but the growth rates that we would expect as we look ahead. So good momentum and actually bullish about where we are in the opportunities for the future. Brad Zelnick : Thanks, Sasan. That's very helpful. And maybe just to follow one for Michelle, Credit Karma is off to a really strong start, and you're now just migrating Turbo users over, and you've got so many growth opportunities ahead that you've talked about in your remarks. Can you just remind us perhaps of the seasonality of this business, because if we just start annualizing the last two months, I think we'd all be getting a little bit ahead of ourselves, what should we keep in mind relative to what we've seen out of the gate versus what you're guiding for the full year? Michelle Clatterbuck : Yes. Thank you, Brad. Good question. We are off to a strong start with Credit Karma, feel good about the progress that they're making. We're seeing the business bounce back more quickly from the pandemic than we had expected, not all the way back to pre-COVID levels, but definitely making progress there. When you think about seasonality in the business, they do see a little bit stronger in the January, February time period, but there isn't a huge seasonality in the business. But I would say in January, February is a little bit more of an uptick. As people are coming into the new year and some of those new resolutions and so forth, but that's what I would say you guys should expect. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted to expand a little bit on Brad Zelnick\u2019s question. Can you help us understand now that the indicators are at or above kind of like the pre-crisis levels, how should we think about the mechanism of how those indicators and the timeframe for when those indicators will translate into kind of the revenue growth rates that you guys have got it to longer-term and that we're expecting. So like how should we moderate our expectations on to how quickly do indicators become sort of the actuality in terms of what we see on the income statement? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, thanks for your question, Keith. And in context of being a subscription business, a lot of the growth rate we're experiencing now is the things that were happening almost a year ago this time. And in context of slower acquisition, retention, dropping a couple of points starting in March of last year. And also, there are a number of things that have huge benefit for customers that we paused, things like payroll full-service, migration, we have a line for where you have to upgrade to QuickBooks Advanced we sort of dropped that line for a while. So it was the combination of acquisition or retention along with very intentional decisions we made around pricing and migration that has had an impact on the growth rates that we're seeing now. And in addition to all of that, we're lapping price increases that we had done the same time last year. So the long answer to your short question is, what we are starting to see now, we should expect the growth rates to be impacted in the year ahead, because a lot of the metrics and the trends that we're experiencing now, we'll see the follow-on benefits in the quarters ahead. But I would say almost think about a year out or so is the way \u2013 is the best way to think about it. Keith Weiss : Got it. Got it. And if I could ask a follow up to Michelle on the margin side of the equation, really appreciate the continued kind of balance between good growth and faster margin expansion over time. Great to see that as part of the corporate philosophy. This quarter in particular we saw the SMB contribution margin up nicely on a year-on-year basis. But I know a lot of companies are talking to us about kind of one-time items or sort of crisis related expense savings that we saw in the year past that might not sustained the year forward. Anything we should be aware of in terms of sort of expenses that might come on board that could upset or not upset, but could temporarily sort of reverse the margin expansion that we've been seeing? Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks for the question Keith, first of all. For us as we've been thinking about margins and margin expansion, really the biggest driver of any of that is us becoming more and more of an AI driven expert platform. And so you may see some expenses here, there, and obviously you see margins move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But I would say really focus on our guidance, which is after last year expanding margins a point. This year we expect margins to expand approximately 110 basis points, once you're excluding Credit Karma. And that is really us continuing to evolve, to being more of a platform company and seeing those areas for us to drive margin expansion across the company everything from technology to customer success to go to market. And so that is the biggest driver of margin expansion for us across the company. Keith Weiss : That\u2019s it. Thank you so much guys. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi guys. I think in some of the prepared remarks and press release, there was the talk of the cross-sell of TurboTax going to Credit Karma, but I'm wondering what the expectations are in terms of the cross-sell and marketing that you could do to Credit Karma users for TurboTax for this tax season? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure, Sterling. Let me just if I could take it up one notch and I'll come back specifically to answer your question. There are a number of things that we have launched. We've launched Credit Karma Money at the end of the TurboTax experience where migrating, Turbo customers that with Turbo being deprecated to Credit Karma. And of course then, to your question launching TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. So there are a number of big things that we're doing and all of them Sterling, I would think about them as long-term opportunities with our focus being testing and experimenting right now to really nail the experience. So I wouldn't expect a really big impacts from those in the near term, but we do expect these to deliver significant customer benefit and growth in the future, because we're really just testing and experimental and really nailed experience before we launch things at scale. So hopefully that answers your question. Sterling Auty : It does. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter. Sasan, on the Analyst Day, you talked about a $24 billion U.S. tax opportunity. And I'm wondering what have you learned from live? And what are the things that that you need to add to live in terms of capabilities, to be able to address this in a larger scale. And also in the same vein as you look at QBO advanced, what are the things that you've learned with that product out at the higher end of the SMB market that you've traditionally played in? And what are the things that you've looking to introduce in the product to make it address the full breadth of the TAM? Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Kash. Let me hear from you. Let me start with live and the 86 million customers that today go to an assisted method. Based on research and work that we did several years ago, one of the learnings that we had is over 70 million of these 86 million customers are actually willing to use a digital platform as long as they can get a health and expertise to be able to file their taxes with confidence. And in fact, they would like to get help beyond taxes, which is where Credit Karma comes in. And so to your question of what we have learned with our beginning our fourth year with the live platform, we're more bullish about the opportunity ahead of us than we were even four years ago when we launched TurboTax live. Because in essence, what we've learned and that's informing what we're executing this season is one, we have 86 million folks that we need to get to consider the fact that there's a digital platform with an expert at their fingertips. And the fact that they can actually hand everything off digitally for an expert, which is where you see what we're doing in our marketing campaigns. And you may only see what we're doing off air on TV, but we've got an incredible campaign in educating our customers in multiple different digital channels to help them understand how this works, because we're really shaping and reshaping the category. So one is about education which is where a lot of our investment is going. The second is when they come in, really nailing the first-time use. Immediately when they come in, to help them understand how to get access to an expert, engaging with an expert, exchanging a document visually and seeing how easy it is. And then with now the launch of full service, if you choose to upgrade the full service or you come in and choose full service, how do we deliver instant benefits. Instant benefit by the way is confidence that there's an expert there. Now, which gets me to the other side of the equation, which I haven't mentioned, and that is our expert platform. That's really where we have advantage. A lot of our AI investments are actually improving our expert platform around scheduling, document exchange, making sure that we connect the right expert to the right customer. Ensuring that we deliver insights to the expert because of our machine learning capabilities, so that when the expert is talking to the customer it actually, they deliver confidence with their know-how and their knowledge, and then being able to, by the way the culture we're creating with the experts that we have on our platform that love the input culture or the income that they make and love the fact that they get to deliver for our customers in the comfort of their home. So those are the areas that we are focused on. And frankly, every day in the season we learned and we adjust and we love our momentum and the opportunities ahead. And what we'll learn over time is we're launching TurboTax Live as part of the Credit Karma platform. And what's unique in launching that as part of the Credit Karma platform is we'll actually be able to deliver a personalized experience because we'll know that you were a prior-year assisted customer. And that again will pay off in the long-term, but those are the things that we're testing now. In terms of your question around disrupting the mid-market with QuickBooks Advanced is a couple of things that we've learned. Frankly, we believe that we can even go higher in the market beyond 10 to a 100 employees. Now, our focus right now is 10 to 100 employees, but as we see the power of our platform and the ability for it to scale, we believe that we can actually serve even bigger mid-market customers at a disruptive price. And to your question, the things that we're continuing to add are things around like workflow management, automated invoice approvals batch in the saying, getting very deep integrations of critical apps that these customers need to be able to grow their business and run their business, some of which Michelle actually mentioned in the script around like DocuSign, HubSpot, Salesforce just a few example. And every day we're learning what we need to add to the platform, but it's a lot of what we do today, just a much, much higher scale. And the confidence has given us is not only being able to go up market, but we're actually \u2013 we have now 70% of the customers that we're getting are upgraders and 30% that are new to the franchise. And we're actually seeing our new to the franchise growing even at a faster rate than what we thought without the focus yet in place to be able to go after new to the franchise. So those are the few elements that I think are worth sharing Kash. Kash Rangan : Very insightful. Thank you so much, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Good afternoon, back on small business. I just wanted to drill and there were a handful of investor questions related to your comments around the pipeline yet Q1 to Q2, the growth rate is decelerating small business. I think many believe that they would stabilize or build, and I just want to make sure we're truly understanding this bet, I mean the comments, the color that you're seeing in the pipeline and close rates, and things behind the scenes are showing a much better growth rate than what that reported number is indicating. And I just want to make sure if there's any anomalies or any differences that investors should be aware of. There's a number of questions just disconnect from the comment relative to the reported number. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure, Brent. One of the things that we've been pretty consistent in communicating is that our growth rates would decline sequentially before they start bouncing and going back up. And that's really what we saw in Q2. It is very consistent with what we expected. And it's consistent with what we expected on a couple of fronts. One, because this time last year or starting in March for several months both acquisition slowed, but also our attrition popped, but in addition to that, there are things that as I mentioned a few moments ago that we paused, like full service migration, we paused our QuickBooks Advanced lineup for those upgraders. We didn't ask them to move up because we didn't want to have them experience that in the early COVID times. And so what we're experiencing now is just a reflection of some of those key indicators that we experienced earlier in the year. And we are on top of that lapping a price increase that we did last year that we didn't do this year. So you've put all of that together. We're actually quite pleased with the growth rates that we experienced in the quarter. Although we expected it to be lower than the last quarter. And then as we look ahead, as I mentioned in the coming quarters and year ahead, a lot of the indicators that Michelle and I shared will start turning into revenue growth, but everything is per our expectation. I think the only thing that's not per our expectation is the business is actually performing better than what we thought in the pandemic and therefore we're bullish about the future. Brent Thill : Great. Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : You're very welcome, Brent. Operator : Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI, your question please. Kirk Materne : Yes. Thanks very much. Actually Sasan, I wanted to actually \u2013 maybe it\u2019s for Michelle, just to per Brent's question, didn't you get four points of benefit from the PPP program last quarter in your 24%. So if we sort of normalize and I guess, did you have any this quarter, because if you normalize for that, you would actually have accelerated from doing the math right from 2022 this quarter. So I guess just keep talking about the PPP program helped the QBO ecosystem at all this quarter? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, I would headline, but I would say \u2013 Michelle, please go ahead. Michelle Clatterbuck : No, that's okay. I was just going to say, Kirk actually the PPP revenue that we got that was actually in Q4 we saw that. And so we did have about a four point decline, if my memory serves me correctly, 28% Online Ecosystem revenue growth in Q4, which then dropped to 24% in Q1 and that actually had a PPP in it, but we didn't have anything material in Q1. Kirk Materne : Okay. That's fine I just wanted to double check that. But Sasan, I guess just sort of on the small business, another question would be on the international growth. Clearly the UK was under a pretty severe lockdown for a lot of this quarter. Did that impact you all at all? I guess international growth is still very strong in the mid-40%. But I was just kind of curious if that was one of the regions that perhaps it was still, maybe taking a little bit longer time to recover. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Kirk it actually has. I mean, I would say if I look at it across the globe, the United States has really not just bounced back nicely, but just the resiliency of our platform. The innovation on the platform is really allowing us to see all the indicators get back to or better than pre-COVID levels. When we look at outside of the United States, countries like UK, Australia, France actually were hit much harder and to your point, they are still, specifically in UK and France in a lockdown so that has impacted the growth rate relative to what we see in the United States. But all of that is within the context of the guidance that we have provided, it has seen a hit. Kirk Materne : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you all. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo Securities. Your question, please. Michael Turrin : Hey, there. Thanks and good afternoon. Going back to Credit Karma, it looks like that segment outperform what we were expecting on the partial quarter. Looking at what\u2019s implied for the rest of the year. It looks like it\u2019s still below the billion dollars that businesses at in 2019. Can we just go back to what some of the factors are that could drive outperformance from that beyond what\u2019s assumed in your current outlook. And then on the margin there is the 26% segment margin, they\u2019re a good building block for us to be thinking about or is the seasonality Michelle referenced somewhat impacting that number as well? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure. Good to hear from you, Michael. Just as a quick refresher, there are three elements around growth in Credit Karma. It\u2019s going to core, which is credit cards and personal loans. It\u2019s expanding our growth verticals, which is auto and home loans and insurance. And then emerging verticals, which is really all around assets, which is money innovation. And none of this is really coming from the third bucket. And the second point I would make is, we sort of have a 75-25, about 75% of the revenue is coming from in the credit cards and personal loans and 25% coming from the growth verticals, which is auto and home loans and insurance, which is actually really improved versus about a year ago, where it was 95% at credit cards and personal loans. And specifically, would that context to answer your question. We\u2019re seeing more partners come back on the platform, we\u2019re seeing new partners come on, we\u2019re starting to see higher spend and because of just the innovation with LightBox and does better matching, we\u2019re getting more customers to actually get connected to the financial products that are right for them and partners are benefiting from it. So the performance we experienced this quarter is just we\u2019re seeing stronger momentum, when it comes to credit cards, personal loans and then the growth vertical specifically around auto insurance. And when we \u2013 look ahead, our overall guidance was just based on the trajectory that we assume for the year, and we\u2019ll just have to continue to see how these verticals play out, but we liked the momentum that we see, but that could be the reason in the long-term for over performance to your question. Specifically around margin, it really important to note that one, we manage margins at the company level. And so really pay attention to the guidance that we provided the company level. Two, we are investing in Credit Karma. It is a \u2013 we see it in the long-term as a big growth engine for the company. The penetration, when you think about the 110 million members that Credit Karma has the penetration with all these different financial products that I mentioned, it\u2019s actually still quite low. So it\u2019s actually quite exciting, as we look ahead the possibilities of increasing penetration. So we are investing dollars in Credit Karma, all within the context of the guidance and margin expansion guidelines that we have provided. So I wouldn\u2019t get too anchored on the current quarter margin rates. It was more because it performed better than what we thought and some of the investments and hiring shifted between quarters. I would more focus on company level operating income that we provided and margin rates that we provided. Michael Turrin : That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Your line is open. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. Just first one quick clarification from me relative to the question that Kirk asked earlier. Michelle, you\u2019ve clarified that, Q4 had the PPP impact and by Q1 there wasn\u2019t one. But given that, that program reopened, I think in earlier this calendar year, can you just confirm whether there was an impacting Q2? Michelle Clatterbuck : No, Jen. That program \u2013 the new PPP program has been moving, you may have seen it in the process and moving much more slowly than anyone had anticipated, and now we don\u2019t have anything in that material on that Q2 results. Jennifer Lowe : Perfect. And then it just pulling on some of the questions around the trajectory in small business, there\u2019s a couple of different factors that you called out. There\u2019s first, the fact that, the economic indicators have improved, but maybe not, everything is back to pre-COVID levels. And then there\u2019s also sort of this lagging effect from some of the subscription businesses or some of the pauses that you took as everyone sort of navigated a very uncertain time. So I just want to clarify if you think about the 30%-plus type aspirations for the online ecosystem component. Is that something you can get back to in the current environment? And it\u2019s just a function of working through some of these sort of leftover impacts from the last six to 12 months. Or do you need to see continued improvement in the broader small business economy as well, to get back to pre-pandemic levels to support that 30%? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Jen. Thanks for your question. What I would say is, the economic indicators are still below pre-COVID levels. It\u2019s more our own indicators and the performance of our platform that has bounced back and in many cases better than the pre-COVID levels, which gets I think the essence of your question, and that is, our goal in the long-term has not changed. We believe that we will get this business specifically, the online revenue growth back above 30% and we just need to keep executing our game plan. And I would tell you that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s heavily relied upon how the economy bounces back, because if you look at where we are today versus six months ago, a lot of the performance that we are talking about is based on the performance of the platform at our execution and the innovation on our platform. Now, at the end of the day, this economy does need a stimulus \u2013 fiscal stimulus to get people back into jobs, but that is not the anchor for us to get back to the growth rates that we believe we could get back to it. It\u2019ll just take some time. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your question, please. Kartik Mehta : Hey, Sasan. When you look at the QuickBooks business, obviously, you\u2019re lapping a price increase, but you haven\u2019t stopped innovation. I\u2019m wondering what metrics you\u2019ll look at to feel comfortable to adjust pricing. Sasan Goodarzi : Kartik, thank you for your question. Our main focus around pricing will be, when we believe it\u2019s the right time given how small businesses are performing and given the pandemic. It is actually not related to our innovation, but as you know, we now have innovation that allows us to go up market with both QuickBooks Advanced and QuickBooks Live, which is a much higher ARPU offering. We have the ability at the garner higher price from customers, but from a price increase perspective, it\u2019s less about the metrics and indicators that we see with our own platform, but more when we believe is the right time to raise prices with customers given, what they\u2019re experiencing and the challenges that they\u2019re experiencing for their business. So the two are in many ways unrelated in terms of the way we think about it. Kartik Mehta : And then just finally, when you look at the Credit Karma customers as far as tax customers is the mix of the products they\u2019re using different than the core TurboTax customers, please, what you\u2019re seeing early on. Sasan Goodarzi : What I would share with you that we\u2019ve learned about the Credit Karma base as a big portion of their customers actually use an assisted method. And that is actually what is exciting to us now. Because they have 110 million members, you can imagine that a strong cross section of folks in the U.S., whether Latin ex, self-employed those that are retail investors. So that cross section is generally consistent with the customers we serve in TurboTax today. What different is, we\u2019ve got a good majority of those customers that in the prior year used an assisted method. Kartik Mehta : Thank you. Appreciate it. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for taking my question. Wanting to ask about the feedback you got from that product based businesses, mainly, QuickBooks Commerce that you launched few months back that seems like that\u2019s an acquisition from TradeGecko mainly has order inventory. I\u2019m wondering, like, how far you can expand that offering, it feels like you can become the back-office platform for this kind of businesses. So what sort of opportunity you are seeing and what sort of feedback you got so far. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure. Thank you, Siti. First of all, we\u2019re very excited about QuickBooks Commerce and it\u2019s also very, very early innings with QuickBooks Commerce. And the acquisition we just made with OneSaas actually allows us to bring data into the platform from marketplaces, from POS providers, from fulfillment apps. And so it really actually helps us \u2013 help the customer understand how they're doing and their profitability, which is what\u2019s most important to the customers. We actually had to restrict the top of the funnel to ensure that we can nail the customer experience. And so our focus first was ensuring that we can serve new customers that don't use our inventory today. Our next focus will be existing QBO customers that don't use any of our inventory capabilities. And then third will be existing QBO customers that actually do use our inventory capabilities. And the reason that's important is we want to ensure that if a customer already has inventory, that we can easily sync all the product catalogs and their product numbers, and to keep their books clean. So net-net, we're just getting started. We had to restrict the top of the funnel because of the demand and the excitement that was out there because we want to be very intentional in terms of building out the capability. Very early indicators are positive with the number of customers that we have on our platform. But again, think about QuickBooks Commerce, think about QuickBooks Cash as these are long-term plays in terms of when and how they will deliver growth, but so far we're bullish about the early indicators. Siti Panigrahi : That's great. Thank you, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : All right. Thank you, Siti. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Michelle, as we think about free cash flow generation overtime, is there any reason that shouldn't closely mirror operating income growth? Michelle Clatterbuck : I'm sorry. Can you repeat that, Brad? I didn't hear the last part of it. Brad Reback : Sure. As we think about free cash flow generation overtime, is there any reason that shouldn't mirror operating income growth? Michelle Clatterbuck : No. No. There shouldn't be any real big reason why you shouldn't see that. No. Brad Reback : Okay. That's great. And then maybe one quick tactical one, Sasan. You talked about QuickBooks Live retention getting better. Is that meaningfully different than QuickBooks Online retention right now? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. The biggest thing, well, first of all, it's very early days. So we look at more cohort of customers versus the aggregate numbers. The biggest reason we're so focused on retention right now with QuickBooks Live is we're focused on understanding customer needs and really nailing the experience, because QuickBooks Live there are customers that come in to get set up. There are customers that come in that want us to provide them advice. And they're just \u2013 they're looking for bookkeeping advice and there are our customers actually want us to do their taxes for them and run their books for them. And what we're really being intentional about is understanding what are the needs, what are the experience that we need to deliver? And what does that look like on the platform, which is why you heard me mention retention. Retention right now is more focused on cohorts. And it is a lower than QBO only because we're looking at different cohorts of customers and their needs are very different. And before we really open up the top of the funnel, we want to make sure that every customer loves the experience that they're getting from us on QuickBooks Live and the team is just innovating like crazy to close some of the gaps in. So we're excited about the possibilities. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Arvind Ramnani : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on a question that was asked earlier around kind of the increase in brokerage accounts. And I just wanted to ask what potential lift from crypto users, this would be the first time these users will need to do some of them \u2013 will be first-time filers, but many of them will certainly be adding the \u2013 kind of the added product for capital gains or losses. Are you seeing any kind of lift from this segment of users? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Arvind, it's not particularly just from the crypto users, we're just \u2013 there are just millions more of customers that are doing their own trading in the U.S. and outside of the United States. And come tax time, they need to be able to do their taxes. And so we're just seeing increase in our Premier product, both with live, because if you need assistance, you can use live. And if you want to Do-It-Yourself, you'd just use force our [ph] Premier Do-It-Yourself product. So we're seeing an overall increase based on an increase in retail investing. I think call out something that's material on the crypto side. Arvind Ramnani : Great. Great. And when you think about the kind of the lift in revenues, I mean, I'm not looking for a specific quantification, but directionally, are you expecting more of a lift from increased ARPU or increased users? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. The way we designed our long-term growth rates is under-penetrated segments, which is investment community, self-employed and Latinx and its TurboTax Live. And with TurboTax Live, just by design, it has a higher ARPU. Now \u2013 right now we are so early in the shaping of the category and being able to acquire our customers that the best thing for you all to anchor on is what we shared at Investor Day, which is our long-term expectations just on the tax side is 8% to 12%. And probably the largest driver of the higher end is ARPU. And just know that we're being very intentional about right now, raising awareness close with our campaigns, but the free expertise that we're providing for those that have very simple returns, just to create awareness in the category, but in the long-term, it's ARPU because of the assistant segment. Arvind Ramnani : Perfect. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : You are welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open. Michael Millman : Thank you very much. A couple of questions. You talked \u2013 you mentioned that Credit Karma was getting some business from assisted. Can you talk about if that normal switching around between different methods or if this is particularly a Credit Karma-type business activity. Secondly, can you talk about and maybe you do this, whether you can use RALs to kind of speed up some of this movement, particularly from assisted and I guess let's talk with those. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure Michael, thank you for your question. The point I made earlier was twofold. One that this is a learning year for us in launching TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. And we're just running a lot of experiments to make sure that we can deliver a fantastic experience before we go big in the out years. But the second comment that I made is that that a good portion, we've not divulged the number of Credit Karma members use the assisted segment. And it's very much connected to when you look at there's $155 million or $160 million IRS returns, $86 million are in the assistant segment, proportionality is the same thing within the Credit Karma base. So that's the point that I was making earlier. To your second question about RALs, really the biggest driver of getting a customer to use a digital platform is actually confidence, not early access to their money. They have to first have confidence that they can get their taxes done right with you, which is where our experts and expertise comes in. And that's really where a lot of our investments are going. We also provide early access to your refund, but really the big driver is about ensuring that we deliver confidence to our experts. Michael Millman : Do you see big opportunity added money to move with confidence over to eliminating RAL kind of money? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, first of all, we're really focused on getting these customers to come to our platform by ensuring that they know that they can get access to an expert. So confidence is first and foremost, and of course our different methods that we can help these customers get early access to the refund. That's very, very consumer friendly. So the answer is yes, but it's secondary to providing expertise to these customers to use the platform. Michael Millman : Great. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : All right, Michael. Michael Millman : And stay safe. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you so much. Thank you. You do the same. Sasan Goodarzi : And thank you everybody. I know we ran a little bit over. I appreciate everyone's questions. I wish everyone well stay safe until next time. We'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you, everybody.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins. Kim Watkins : Thank you, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2021 conference call. I\u2019m here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2020 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong third quarter. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue accelerated to 20% this quarter, and Credit Karma performed very well with revenue at an all-time high for the quarter. Our tax results through the May 17, IRS tax filing deadline reflect another strong season. As a result, we are raising our revenue, operating income, and earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2021. Let me start with tax. We are proud of how we delivered for our customers, and executed our strategy of expanding our lead in the Do-It-Yourself category and transforming the assisted category. Based on our performance through the May 17 IRS tax filing deadline, we expect our Consumer Group revenue to grow 11% to 12% during fiscal year 2021. We expect total IRS returns to be up approximately 1% and our share of total returns to expand an estimated 1 point for the tax filing season. This results in expected total customer growth of 6%, and double-digit revenue growth for the fourth year in a row. The average revenue per return increased, reflecting a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix-shift to our Premier offering used by investors. We made significant progress this season. Within the Do-It-Yourself category, we continued to double down on underpenetrated segments, including LatinX, Self-Employed, and investors. We saw a significant acceleration in investor customer growth this season and expect it to more than triple over last year. We expect the base of customers paying us nothing to grow 6% this season. Within transforming the assisted category, we continue to make progress connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live. We expect customers to grow more than 90% this season compared to 70% growth last year, and TurboTax Live customers new to Intuit to be up more than 100%. More broadly, our AI-driven expert platform strategy and five Big Bets are driving strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the company. These Big Bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. As a reminder, these bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'll highlight the notable progress we've made this quarter on three of these Big Bets, and we will provide a detailed update on all five Big Bets at Investor Day in the fall. Our third big bet is to unlock smart money decisions. With Credit Karma\u2019s data platform and powerful network effects, we are making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. To deliver on this goal, our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans; expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans, and insurance; and develop emerging verticals focused on digital money offerings such as savings and checking accounts. Credit Karma also provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. Credit Karma achieved its largest quarterly revenue ever in Q3, while the number of members, monthly active users, and frequency of member visits reached all-time highs. Within the core, credit card and personal loan revenue was at a record high on a combined basis, reflecting an increase in both the number of partners and member engagement. The growth verticals also achieved all-time-high revenue, reflecting strong momentum in auto insurance followed by home loans and auto loans. And we are developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, part of our digital money offering. We continue to make great progress combining our capabilities to fuel the success of Credit Karma. Since the acquisition closed, TurboTax customers and migrating Turbo users accounted for 40% of new Credit Karma members, significantly accelerating new member growth. We are pleased with the initial performance of Credit Karma Money, which we integrated into the TurboTax filing experience, offering approximately 36 million TurboTax customers the opportunity to deposit up to $88 billion of tax refunds into no-fee checking accounts. Providing this product integration helps members achieve their financial goals, drives member engagement, and creates a new revenue stream for the company in the future. The more we successfully innovate for Credit Karma members, the more times members visit the platform, and the more opportunities we have to offer members products that are right for them, resulting in more monetization opportunities for Intuit. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we are continuing to innovate to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. We are excited about our progress with QuickBooks Cash, a small business bank account that helps our customers manage working capital. QuickBooks Cash presents a full financial picture along with the ability to move money instantly and ensures that their money is working for them, while taking advantage of the built-in accounting of QuickBooks. We achieved a milestone this quarter as QuickBooks Cash balances surpassed $100 million, and we\u2019re seeing strong active use among both new and existing customers. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. The usage of services such as payments, payroll, and time tracking with QBO Advanced customers is more than 30% higher than the next QBO offering in our line-up, contributing to higher ARPC while overall engagement is up over ten points year-to-date. We are very pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plan to win, accelerated by digital tailwinds. Across all of our big bets, we are building momentum and accelerating innovation which we believe positions us well for durable growth into the future. Now let me hand it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $4.2 billion, GAAP operating income of $1.9 billion versus $1.4 billion last year, non -GAAP operating income of $2.2 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.30 versus $4.11 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.07 versus $4.49 last year. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue grew 34% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. The revenue we are reporting today is for our third quarter ending April 30. That said, based on our performance through the May 17 tax filing deadline, we are raising our Consumer Group revenue guidance to 11% to 12% growth for fiscal 2021, up from 9% to 10% previously. There are four primary drivers in our Consumer business. Note that these levers exclude approximately 8 million stimulus filings last season. This data reflects our expectations for the season through July 31, 2021 versus the prior season through July 31, 2020. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS, which we expect to be up approximately 1% by the end of the season. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to be approximately flat by the end of the season. The third driver is our share. We expect our share of total tax returns to expand one point this season and our share of the DIY category to be up approximately one point. The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. This growth reflects a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix-shift to our Premier offering used by investors. Turning to the ProConnect Group, revenue grew 22% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. For the full year, we expect ProConnect Group revenue growth of 2%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 20% during the quarter, including one point from approximately $10 million of non-recurring Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, revenue. Online Ecosystem revenue was up 28%, including two points of growth from approximately $7 million of PPP revenue. Our longer-term expectation remains 30% or greater online ecosystem revenue growth, driven by 10% to 20% growth in both customers and ARPC. We expect to return to 30% online ecosystem revenue growth at some point during fiscal '22. Our strategic focus within Small Business and Self-Employed is to grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 24% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by customer growth and mix-shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking and capital grew 34% in fiscal Q3, or 31% excluding PPP revenue. Within payments, revenue growth reflects continued customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continued to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from a mix-shift to our full service offering and growth in payroll customers. During the quarter, we began migrating customers once again to our new full service line-up. This did not have a significant impact on revenue during the quarter. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q3. Total international online revenue grew 38% on a constant currency basis. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 9% in the third quarter, including approximately $3 million of PPP revenue. As a reminder, in the third quarter last year the desktop business declined sharply, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits in Q3. Note that we discontinued the TurboTax and QuickBooks Self-Employed bundle this year. We remain committed to serving the self-employed segment. However, after years of experimentation, we determined that serving self-employed customers through separate TurboTax and QuickBooks offerings is most effective. There was no material impact to revenue or operating income from this decision. Moving on to Credit Karma, revenue was $316 million in Q3, as the business continues to gain momentum, reflecting growing members, member engagement and expansion of new and existing partners across verticals. Revenue reached a record high in the quarter. We are also seeing engagement reach a new high watermark, with both monthly active users and frequency of member visits at all-time highs, giving us more opportunities to offer members products that are right for them. Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I\u2019ve shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities, with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We return excess cash that we can\u2019t invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $380 million of stock during the third quarter. We have approximately $1.8 billion remaining on our authorization, and we expect to be in the market each quarter this year. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, payable July 19, 2021. This represents an 11% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance. Our guidance for fourth quarter fiscal 2021 includes revenue growth of 26% to 28%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.78 to $0.83 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.60. We are also raising our fiscal 2021 guidance following strong performance in the first three quarters of the year. Our new guidance includes revenue growth of 22%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 17%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.96 to $7.01 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.32 to $9.37. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of 21% in fiscal 2021. You can find our full Q4 and updated fiscal 2021 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Michelle. I\u2019m very proud of our team and remain optimistic about the future. We have a large addressable market with secular tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities, and digital money offerings. With our strategy of becoming an AI-driven expert platform and five Big Bets, we are positioned well for accelerated innovation and growth. Let's now open it up to your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. Very nice quarter. Good to see momentum really across all parts of the business heading into your Q4. Two questions, one for Sasan on Credit Karma. You talked a little bit about starting to see some of those revenue synergies between Credit Karma and TurboTax. Can you dive into that a little bit more in terms of versus your expectations, how well have those offers been working? I mean, I saw them when I was doing my taxes in TurboTax and saw the offers for Credit Karma. Have you you've been taking it, taking you guys up on that, has that been a material contributor as of yet? And are there like kind of linkages that we should be thinking about on the QuickBooks side of the equation where you're starting to create those connections as well? And then maybe one for Michelle? Now, we're looking for 100 basis points of margin expansion this year in the revised guidance. That's awesome. Does this take away from future years? Are we getting sort of a pull forward of operating margins or could we see consistency in this operating margin expansion on a go-forward basis? Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Great Keith, thank you for your question. I've one clarifying question for you. You asked about QuickBooks, was the QuickBooks question connected to Credit Karma or was that a specific question? Keith Weiss : The gist of the question was around Credit Karma, like the linkages between Credit Karma and TurboTax, and then if there are any linkages between Credit Karma and QuickBooks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, got it. Very, very helpful. So, I think the place I would start it is, if you go back a year plus from the time we've been working with Credit Karma, really their focus even during the pandemic was to deliver benefits for customers from the perspective of how to manage their money, credit scores, how to get some of the COVID-19 Relief Act help. And one of the things that happened based on just the obsessive focus on customers is their engagement increased at a time where the pandemic was impacting the supply side of the equation. In addition to that, their investment in Lightbox and getting our partners to really understand Lightbox, the value of Lightbox, how it's good for consumers and how it's good for partners whether it's financial institutions and insurance companies is now really paying off, because what you're seeing now is because the member engagement was up and to the right, we have more transactions that are happening on Lightbox, which really for the consumer means a much better match and eligibility for the partner. It means they are able to also make a perfect match. All of those things is really what's resulting in the momentum that we see right now not only in the quarter, which is credit cards and personal loans and the area where the company has been investing 13-plus years, but also in the last year plus new areas which is auto insurance, auto loans, and home loans, so that's the acceleration that we're seeing. And, a lot of the synergy opportunity are going to pay off in the future. And particularly, there are several, one that we've talked about is ensuring that we with customers\u2019 permission move all their data records from TurboTax to Credit Karma, so that they can get much more personalized offers that are right for them on the first click.  The launching of Credit Karma, both in the TurboTax experience, but also launching TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. This is really all about a learning year. We ran 40-plus experiments, Keith learned a ton, made a number of adjustments, and I think it positions us for the months and the years ahead. So, a lot of the opportunities that we think about are better synergies between the two companies are coming in the future, and that really is what's exciting. What I would say has been a near-term impact is the fact that 40% of the new Credit Karma members actually came from either TurboTax and/or the fact that we deprecated Turbo, and that has been an instance, sort of a thrust for Credit Karma, but a lot of what I just described is yet to come, which is what's exciting about the platform. Specifically, to your question around QuickBooks, that has been sequenced for some time down the road. Keith, we're very focused on what's most important, the biggest drivers of innovation and benefits for our members, and QuickBooks is going to be something that we'll think about down the road, but it's been very intentionally sequenced, so we don't distract the team. Keith Weiss : Got it. Super helpful. Michelle Clatterbuck : And Keith, your question on margin expansion, we do believe that over the long-term the platform leverage is real enabling us to expand margins. Last year, we had a point of expansion. This year before Credit Karma, we had guided 110 basis points of expansion, and now our updated guide with Credit Karma is 90 basis points of expansion, so whether that's looking at technology or customer success or go to market, there are opportunities for us to continue to leverage the platform. However, I would remind you that this year is just very unique. We were deep in the pandemic at the beginning of the year, and we were conservative with our spending. Specifically, if you look at something like Credit Karma, it really took a while even though they really started to bounce back much more quickly than we anticipated, but it took us a while to be able to ramp up the spend when we saw that, and we do feel like we will continue to invest to drive accelerated growth in there. So, I would just say this year is a little bit a unique year with the pandemic. Keith Weiss : Got it. Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Keith. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Ken Wong : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Sasan, I wanted to dive into TurboTax Live a little bit. You highlighted seeing 90% growth, a really nice step up from the 70% last year. How should we think about where these customers came from? Is it from the assisted category? Was it from just upselling your existing base? And then any color you can provide on this initial year of full service? What that adoption rate looks like? And then for Michelle, just also a quick question on spend. It looks like R&D saw a really big step up this quarter, looked like roughly 30% year-over-year. How should we think about kind of where those investments are being funneled? And is that kind of the right pace of growth, at least for the near-term future on the product side? Sasan Goodarzi : Great, Ken. Let me let me take the first part of your question. And thank you for the question. The thing I would start with is, I would want all of you to think about TurboTax now as a platform, and it is a platform that allows you to do your taxes yourself, or we give you the opportunity to provide an expert to help you get your taxes done with you, and/or you can, in essence hand everything off to us and we'll do your taxes for you completely. And so really the momentum of accelerating from 70% growth to 90% growth is the fact that we are continuing to build momentum. We're improving the platform. We are doing a far better job raising awareness, more folks are considering getting help in this world in a virtual world. And we're delivering really excellent experiences where our product recommendation scores are continuing to be one of the best that we've seen across the company. So, I bring that up just to say that what you're just experiencing, and what we are experiencing is momentum. And full service just plays a halo effect our role, the fundamental problem that we are solving for customers is one of confidence. And they want to know that if they need help, that they can get access to an expert or even the midstream, if they want to just hand everything off to somebody else to do their taxes, they can do it right off the bat. And so it provides a halo effect for the entire franchise that I can get my taxes done with TurboTax. And whether or not I delegate everything now and next year, perhaps just ask for an expert or even the year after that I do it myself, that all helps the franchise. So that's the role that it's playing, which is why we're seeing the accelerated growth. And, we'll share some of the specific metrics perhaps at Investor Day, but the majority of these customers are continuing to come from the assisted category. Michelle Clatterbuck : And then Ken, your question R&D. First of all, I would not focus too much on what you see just quarter-to-quarter changes. It can really get a little confusing when you do that. I'd look more at the year-to-date span. But, as for where we're investing our R&D funds, when you look at the increases year-over-year, it's really around how do we continue to make investments in the platform. And that will help us drive the big bets so we can accelerate growth across the company. And so that's really where we're tending to do more of the increases in our investments with R&D. Ken Wong : Great. Thanks for the clarity there, Michelle. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne : Yeah. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Sasan, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the QBO business this quarter, just in terms of what you're seeing maybe geographically in terms of the reopening? How that's impacting, not only new business formation, but the willingness for people to take on some of your higher order services, whether it's payroll, payments, even commerce or really that one early on. Or just give some more color on that that would be great. And then maybe just a quick comment on the desktop side is actually a really strong quarter for desktop. So just curious to know if there's anything sort of seasonal about that, that we should be keeping in mind. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, sure. Thank you for the question Kirk. A couple of things, I would say, one biggest thing that we've learned in the last year is just how resilient the platform is, and how much customers needed in very tough times. And so we are seeing usage of our services across the board up into the right and better than pre-pandemic levels. And up into the right, pretty much across all industries. We're pleased with not only the existing core platform, but some of the new innovations that we have inclusive of things like QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advanced, which go after a certain segment of customers, but also have a higher ARPU. What I would say is, outside of the U.S. and Canada, recovery has been slower. So from a geographic perspective, the strength is really U.S. and Canada. And then particularly answer your question on desktop, I think, as Michelle said, it's less about seasonality but more from the perspective of desktop also saw a very deep decline this time last year, and what we're seeing is just a rebound compared to a weak quarter. But overall, we're very pleased with the Small Business trajectory and where we're headed with all the innovation. Kirk Materne : Super thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. Let me quote my congratulations to Sasan, Michelle, and the team here. Two questions, one as you march up the full chain, if you will, on a QBO Advanced, I'm wondering if you have a perspective on how digital transformation on the back office is percolating into your end of the QuickBooks ecosystem? And also secondly, as a company, what are the things that you've learned during the pandemic that has caused you to accelerate your own digital transformation, internal Intuit? Any lessons that we could take from your experiences as you digitally transformed yourself? Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, thank you for the question, Kash. A couple of things I would say, one, we are pleased with what we're seeing not only with our move up market, but some of the higher ARPU offerings. As I mentioned earlier, QuickBooks Advanced is not only the team doing a great job with penetration, but also our services, the usage of our services is up 30% compared to any other QBO in the lineup. What that is an indication of is just the size of the businesses that we are serving. But also, in some ways, the digital transformation for the mid-market is the same, if not a little bit behind the smaller businesses, which is why we're so excited about the possibilities with QuickBooks Advanced to truly give them a customer as a platform that becomes the source of truth for their entire business. Specifically to your question around internal, I would say that from some of the decisions that we made years ago, with a lot of the tools that we use internally, one our shifted AWS, the collaboration tools that we use internally, these were decisions and choices that we made three to four years ago. And we're fortunate that we're now using a lot of these digital tools internally, along with, of course, our shift to AWS. I would say that, although the usage went up in the pandemic, it didn't inform a different set of decisions, because I think as a team, these decisions were made proactively four to five years ago. Kash Rangan : Wonderful. Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I got two quick ones. Maybe Sasan, first, from a big picture perspective, if you zoom out and put this tax season into context for us comparing it to last year, and then pre-pandemic, as well as how to think about it for the next few years around both unit versus ARPU growth. Clearly, this year ARPU growth was a big driver with live and assistant. But just stepping back kind of put it into context for us what do we learn? And how should we think about that algorithm going forward? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, thank you for the question, Alex. Big picture, we're very pleased with what we experienced this season. And it's consistent with what we declared several years ago. Our biggest opportunity for continued growth is to be able to transform the assisted category. There's 86 million folks that, in essence, get assistance to get their taxes done, it's more than $20 billion in size. And beyond that, there's about an $8 billion business tax segment. The second is under penetrated segments, which is investors, self-employed and LatinX. And when you look at our results this year, coming sort of out of the pandemic, our TurboTax Live platform accelerated to 90%. We saw our investor segment actually grow triple what it did last year. We always want to continue to grow units, which will then result in ARPU. I think given that our biggest opportunity is not only underpenetrated segments and transforming assisted, we may just see more ARPU than units. It's more a result of our strategy and where we are focused and where the biggest opportunity is. So if I put this season in context of our strategy, I would say it is absolutely in line with our strategy. And it's for us, it's more about just continuing to accelerate in the areas that we declared several years ago. Alex Zukin : Perfect. And then on Karma. Clearly, I think, just to Keith's point, are you seeing the synergies come sooner than you thought from the rest of the business? Is it more around improvements in the macro economy, loosening lending standards? What is causing Credit Karma to be so strong so soon? And in your mind, the biggest driver for that both for Q4 and beyond from here help us model it, because the seasonality can be clearly the series a little bit unique with that respect. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. If you just step back, what really drives Credit Karma's growth is the number of numbers, the number of transactions per member, and then the revenue per transaction. So that's sort of big picture metrics. The second is if you think about Credit Karma, it's got well over 110 million customers, and it's a data platform that creates a powerful network effect. And really, it's technology driven via Lightbox. And really our opportunity is to continue to not only grow the products that we have today, which is credit cards and personal loans, but also the new products which is auto and home insurance and home loans, but also the new areas that we're moving into, which is Credit Karma Money that we've talked about, which is savings, checking, early access to wages, and then ultimately, you can also get your taxes done on Credit Karma. And by the way, there is no boundary to what product verticals that will launch over time, because we've got a relationship with over 100 million customers. We deliver personalized experiences, and they know that, we're there for them. And we're putting the power of their data in their hands. So I bring that up to say that during the pandemic, we were obsessively focused on benefits, even though the market was sort of in shambles. When I say the market because of the health crisis. So what you're seeing now is, one, the benefit a lot of the work that we did during the pandemic, launching these new verticals, delivering benefits to customers that was about how to manage their money in their credit score, and our really member engagement went up and to the right, even during the pandemic. And so now, with coming out of the pandemic, and more financial institution being in Lightbox, we're actually seeing more transactions in Lightbox, which makes a more personalized match for not only the consumer, but it benefits significantly the financial institution. So, this is not just a macro recovery, it's an end. And looking ahead, we believe that the combination of what I just described and being able to leverage our distribution of customers, combining the data that we have, that we can continue to sustain the growth in Credit Karma and of course, we'll talk more about that at Investor Day. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you, Alex. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Sasan, on small business online, I was curious if you could just drill into international. You did see a pretty big deceleration from 51% growth in Q1 to 38%. And I'm just curious, going back to, I think your earlier comment about the U.S. showing a good recovery. Is there anything going on there that is Intuit specific or is this more specific to what's happening in the unevenness of those recovery of those small businesses? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, actually Brent the latter part of your comment, we continue to invest in international in fact, very similar to what I just described with, we were heavily focused on delivering for customers and Credit Karma during the pandemic. We're really doing the same thing in international. It's really two big things, one, the lapping price increases, and two, the recovery is just simply much slower outside of U.S. and Canada, and it's not Intuit specific. Brent Thill : Great, thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Well, very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for taking my question. Sasan on the QBO side 28% growth with no lapping price increases. That's impressive. Just wondering what you're seeing in terms of new customer acquisitions given that in the U.S., we saw a new business creation was phenomenal last three quarters. And also be interesting to hear what you're seeing on the retention side, as well in the small business. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, thank you for your question. Both new acquisition and retention is very strong, both in U.S. and Canada. And we're seeing continuing to see an acceleration in both areas. And the businesses that tend to typically come to QuickBooks, they're a little bit more mature. So it's not directly tied to new business formations. This goes back to what I've been talking about for the last, frankly, two years before the pandemic, which is we're seeing a shift to a virtual solution, a shift to online and omnichannel and a shift to digital money offering. And I think what we're just seeing here is the pandemic accelerated that five plus years and so both new acquisition and retention continues to be strong. Based on a lot of our innovation and just the economic recovery, we've seen that same strength in payroll and payments in time tracking, which is why as Michelle mentioned earlier, we actually expect sometime in our fiscal year '22 to be at or above our 30% online ecosystem growth. Siti Panigrahi : And then quick follow-up on the TurboTax Live full service. I'm wondering do you have any kind of technology advantage in terms of processing it faster, given that like all your competitors asking to drop it into the Dropbox or anywhere. So is there any sort of technology advantage you guys have versus your competitors there? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, let me just -- I'll talk about us, and that is that our biggest advantage is the technology. We have been building this platform and these capabilities for eight plus years. And particularly, it's in the area of machine learning, knowledge engineering and natural language processing. And everything that we are doing in TurboTax Live, whether it's providing you help with an expert or full service is all technology led. Our machine learning and knowledge engineering capabilities not only continue to make the platform easier for the consumer, but also much, much easier and insightful for the expert, which means that our experts are far more effective, far more efficient, can focus on the value that they bring to customers. And really a lot of our investments that we make in R&D go into our Live platform, which by the way, also benefits QuickBooks Live. So, we believe we have a significant technology advantage. We've been adding over the last several years process engineers that are also helping us improve our processes. And that combined with technology is really what's giving us the advantage that we have and the type of growth that we are experiencing. Because we measure not only recommendation scores by our consumers, but also for our experts, and our recommendations scores for our experts are also often to the right because of the ease of the platform. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much, and good afternoon. And congratulations, great job across all the segments. I'm going to focus on the tax segment. First off, Sasan, you all chose to wait until next quarter to depict your unit volume and your metrics in tax. And I assume that's largely because of the economic income payments from last year making it tricky. But the question embedded here is, what type of activity do you expect to see maybe as a percent of overall from May 18 to July 31 this year thinking back to past years? How much do you know is what I'm asking of the season now that you've seen the end of the tax season, when you extrapolate this guidance to the end of July? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, sure. Scott, I'll say two things. One, we have pretty good visibility to the end of the tax season, or through the end of our fiscal year, July. The main reason we didn't provide the table is the tax season is not done. Places like Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas, their deadlines have been extended to June 15. And last year, those were 10.5% of all of the Federal filings. So it's a pretty significant amount of the Federal filings. And so that was really why we wanted to provide the table when everything is conclusive. With that said, we feel good about what we see, because in some ways 90% of the season is behind us. At the same time, the season has not done yet and we're continuing to focus on winning every filer that's out there. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. And then really a two parter for my follow-up. One, I'd love your view on category shift this year. We've seen for years DIY pay category shift, and it sounds like it's going to be flattish this year. So just your thoughts on the year-over-year comparison, and it's probably something having to do with that. But your thoughts on that this year and then going forward? And then the second part of the question is, with everything you've said about 90% up in TurboTax Live customers and the Premier category tripling, really implies a lot of revenue per return growth. I'm guessing that's being offset by free of which you had a lot. So the second part of the question is your thoughts on free this year and going forward? Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Sure, Scott. First of all, the way we keep score now is the total IRS returns. What we're really focused on is what is our share of all the returns. And so we're actually quite pleased that our total share of all of IRS returns is up one point. And the reason that's the way we keep score now is because of our TurboTax Live platform. So that's the first thing. I think the second thing I would say is, if you look at last year, IRS total returns were up about 3% to 4%. And then the Do-It-Yourself category actually grew about two points. And this year was flat. And so when we think about the category, we actually look at it over a two year period because it's really not comparing apples to apples. It was a very unusual last year with all of the folks that came in because of the stimulus check. So, we're actually quite pleased that when you look at this year in context of last year, that our share of total IRS went up one point, the categories stayed flat, and then our share within the category went up one point. So we're very, very pleased with the results. But I also wanted to just emphasize how we really keep score. I think the second thing I would say is, our free grew 6% this year, the pay nothing customers. And that compares to 20% growth last year. So we actually feel like free moderated and it's in the vicinity that we would have predicted and assumed and really, our growth came from the areas that are very strategic, which is both transforming the assisted category with TurboTax Live and then the under penetrated segments, which is what we expect for continued growth as we look in the years ahead. Scott Schneeberger : Got it. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo Securities. Your question, please? Michael Turrin : Hey, there. Thanks. Good afternoon. My congrats on executing through, it was certainly a unique year here as well. Online ecosystem showing signs of rebound as we get through the course of the year 26% ex-PPP, sounds like there's still confidence and ability to return to that 30% plus target level. Anything else you can add just around what provides confidence in reinforcing and getting back to that level of giving increasing scale? And maybe how we should think about the mix between services and QBO? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, sure. Michael, thank you for your question. What really gives us confidence is, the fact that when you look at the total SMB market, nearly 70% of that market is service based businesses and about 30% are product based businesses. And the majority of all of those customers are what we call non-consumption, they're not using a digital platform, they're managing their life and their business through a shoebox, or a Google Sheet or an Excel spreadsheet. So what gives us confidence is really the innovation and the focus of our innovation in the last several years. One, we are now positioned to continue to deliver for service based businesses, all of our innovation. We now have QuickBooks commerce, that gives us the opportunity to also serve product based businesses. We're able to disrupt from the bottom with QuickBooks Cash, which is a business banking account. And really, we're able to go after non-consumption with QuickBooks Live, which really solves the confidence problem, and provides access to an expert for our customers, whether one-time or ongoing basis, and we're positioned to go up market with QuickBooks Advanced. And within that, what I didn't mention is, of course, all of our innovation and payments, payroll, time tracking, et cetera. So, what really gives us confidence is the fact that we're positioned well to serve the market in a meaningful way. We've continued to improve the experience of our platform. We have more partners on our platform, and we're a true open platform. And really, we are rethinking our go to market, both from a sales and marketing perspective. So it's really our innovation and transformation of sales and marketing that gives us confidence. Now that the economy is starting to come back, that is really what sort of is the ultimate confidence factor as we look at 30% plus online revenue growth. Michael Turrin : That's all very helpful. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jackson Ader : Great. It's Jackson Ader on for Sterling. Thanks for taking our questions. Actually, just a quick one from us. And it's on the investors. So tripling the investor base is certainly positive. And I'm just curious what that retention rate looks like for those TurboTax Investor customers relative to maybe the entire TurboTax space? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, sure. In looking at history, those that have used our Premier offering have actually had one of the highest retention rates, because of just the type of customer and the complexity of the customer. This tripling this year was both new customers coming into the franchise and actually existing customers that upgraded to Premier, because they in essence took on investments that they may not have done in the past. If we just look at the experience that we delivered for them, the product recommendation scores in history, we would feel good about the retention going forward. Jackson Ader : Okay, all right. Great. That's all we had. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Maybe pushing on the retention theme a little bit. Sasan, as you think about the early cohorts of TurboTax Live customers, have they for the most part remained in the live skew? Or, is it a fluid situation with some years they take it, some years they move back to Quick TurboTax. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Brad, it's actually somewhat fluid and we like it. Now that we're in our fourth year of TurboTax Live, one of the things that we love about it is customers that come in that we typically would have lost because they wouldn't have access to an expert will upgrade to TurboTax Live. We've not divulged the percentages, but good percentage will stay in TurboTax Live the second year, some actually go back to TurboTax. And now this year, we saw some that started in live the year after went back to TurboTax and this year came back to TurboTax Live. We've not divulged any of the percentages. But what's great about that is, back to the Uber point, which is we are solving a major confidence problem. What we really care about is that we can solve the customer's problem and the confidence factor, and that they stay in the franchise. And going back and forth between Do-It-Yourself, I need help with an expert or here's all my stuff just do it for me is the cycle that we are seeing. We're actually pleased with what we're seeing. Brad Reback : That's great. Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Jester of Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe if I reflect on that 90% growth in live obviously QuickBooks Live is also growing. To your comments, the economy's reopening, the macro economy looks better. How are you going to keep your expert partners on the platform in the year ahead? I suspect over the last 12-months is pretty easy to get folks in the door. But maybe talk about your retention strategy to keep those expert partners on the platform in the year ahead. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, thank you for your question, Daniel. In fact, I would share with you that the last couple of years, it's not been easy, because everybody is -- and I don't mean in our space, but everybody's actually trying to find ways to shift to a virtual world and the pandemic just simply accelerated. So, as we look ahead, we're not looking at headwinds, because we've actually been dealing with a market that's really going after these type of experts in multiple different industries. There's a couple of things that not only helps us retain our experts, but acquire more and this is, of course based on verbatims and talking to our experts. One, it's our culture, it is the way we treat employees, it's the benefits that we deliver. It's the overall employee experience that they have. And they're truly able to work virtually with the setup that they need and to do what they love, which is deliver for customers and not have to market their services. We are unique in that. We don't ask our experts to sell, we ask our experts to do one thing, which is deliver an awesome experience for our customers. We've had a quite high retention rate. We have been able to recruit the best of the best. And by the way, we actually have very high standards. We have what we call A for A process, which is assessing for awesome. They have to pass certain hurdles to be able to join us. We measure the recommendation scores. So there's a service standard that they have to be able to deliver against. And now we also provide certifications. And so we help them with education to get certified and to actually be able to grow their careers. So we really treat our experts like the way we would care for and treat employees, and that is I would say the differentiator beyond the course the benefits that we provide. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your question, please? Kartik Mehta : Hey, Sasan. I wanted to go back to your Credit Karma comments and new customer growth. And I'm wondering, if you look at the new customer growth that you've seen in the most recent quarter, or maybe the last few months, are you kind of back to the pre-pandemic level? Obviously, not when Credit Karma started but as the company matured and kind of if you look at 2019 and compare it to where you are today. Sasan Goodarzi : Kartik, good to hear from you. I think without getting into the numbers, which again, we'll talk about more at Investor Day. The place I would start as Credit Karma, significantly during the pandemic reduced their marketing and really focus on the 100 million customers that they had to really focus on ensuring that they could manage through the pandemic, which is a lot of the reasons why we're seeing the type of bounce that we're seeing now, because they truly took good care of their customers during the pandemic. And really the big thrust is now we're starting to do marketing with Credit Karma not only within app, but also outside of the app, and 40% of the customers that came in or members that came in were all Intuit customers that chose Credit Karma. So, I would say in some ways, we're probably above pre-pandemic levels, and we're excited about the possibilities as we look ahead. Kartik Mehta : And then just on the TurboTax full service solution, which you're having very good success with. As you look at the type of customers that are drawn to that solution, what's kind of the breakdown? Or, what are greater number of customers? Are the ones that are using more simple services? Do they have very complex returns? Sasan Goodarzi : It's a variety, Kartik. It comes down to confidence. Those customers that -- let me actually take a step back, out of the 86 million folks that use an assisted method based on our own research that we did several years ago, 70 million are willing to switch to a digital solution as long as they can have access to an expert. So really, these are folks that are choosing to use a digital platform, as long as they can get expert help and their needs could vary. So it's not just the simple filers, it's really an individual that chooses to use a digital platform with expertise. And so we're getting all kinds of variety of folks that are choosing to come to TurboTax Live, and not just TurboTax full service. Kartik Mehta : Well, thank you, Sasan, I appreciate it. Sasan Goodarzi : You're very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Please go ahead. Matt Pfau : Hey, thanks. Just had a question around the free users that you've added over the past two years, a big part of the model has been the ability to bring customers in through free and then have them move up to other tiers, as they experienced certain life events. Are you seeing any difference in the cohorts that you've brought in over the past two years in terms of that ability to potentially monetize these free users over time? And then, are you also able to market Credit Karma to these customers? Or, are there some restrictions around that, depending upon how they come into the Intuit franchise? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Sure, Matt. Our strategy is unchanged. We want as many free customers as we can get for exactly the reasons that you mentioned. One, we want to serve those customers, but then, two, over time, as a life situation changes, they may have different tax needs. But now with Credit Karma, we have an opportunity to provide other benefits beyond taxes. So our strategy is unchanged. I would say, if I use this year particularly as an example, we have end to end focus on free, and particularly with TurboTax Live basic, where we got quite a bit of folks that came in, that were from the assisted category that we love, because ultimately, it's about transforming the assisted category. So, our strategy is unchanged. And the growth that we saw was really in line with what we would have expected. There are no restrictions with Credit Karma. As I mentioned earlier, we have one launched Credit Karma as a test as part of the TurboTax filing experience. And we have launched TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma platform. And we ran 40 tests this year, just to learn to understand how we could really nail the experience. And we're going to be able to now given our learning scales to a different level, as we look at it, but there are no restrictions in terms of what we can and can't do. It's really all focused on the customer experience. Matt Pfau : Great. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Oh, great. Thanks, guys. And congratulations on a real nice quarter. I wanted to ask about QuickBooks Advanced. You've obviously seen some real traction there. And it's an effort to kind of move up market. Is there a limit where perhaps, you draw the line north of which it's going to be difficult for QuickBooks to kind of go? Or, is this really an opportunity, maybe even to go into the next year, maybe in the lower end of the mid-market at some point as you kind of move up market with QuickBooks Advanced? Obviously, there's that balance between optimizing for the Small Business and then features for larger organizations. So how are you thinking about that balance? And where would that limit potentially be? Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Sure, Brad. Thank you. First of all, our initial limit that we set just for the sake of focus and really nailing the experience has been small businesses that are between 10 to 100 employees. We are very pleased with our progress. We're continuing to build out the platform to be able to continue to move up market, even within that 10 to 100 employee segment. With that said, to your question, we don't believe that there's a limit other than what we don't want to do is serve the Intuit's of the world. We don't want to get into a place where we're serving a company the size of Intuit. And we don't want to get into a place where we get into professional services, and we're having to customize the platform. We want it to be something that we can scale, and that is durable. So, the limit will not stop at 100. We put that limit on ourselves to ensure that we can really nail the experience and be very intentional and focused around our scaling. And at the right time, of course, we'll communicate to you all when we choose to go beyond 100. But we believe that there's an opportunity beyond the segment that we serve today. Brad Sills : That's great, Sasan. One more similar question on TurboTax, with the progress you're seeing in full service, do you feel you have the talent base within your CPA pool to be able to kind of go into even some of the most sophisticated tax returns, as you move up into different tax brackets and complexity for returns? Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, sure. We do and we're providing our own training and certification, because one of the things that's really exciting and unique about what we're doing is, we are going after a confidence problem for both consumers and small businesses. So as we recruit, we're not only recruiting to ensure that we have the right expertise that can deliver for customers need to get their taxes on, but also for small businesses that not only need advice, but need to get their quarterly taxes done. So in addition to hiring the best of the best, and looking at partners that are in the marketplace, we also are building our own capabilities around training and certification. So with both those dimensions, we feel really good about the type of skill that we'll be able to acquire and retain, but also how we can grow those skills. Brad Sills : That's great. Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open. Michael Millman : Thank you. I guess, it's a question of what accelerated means. So, can I look at your bottom line and expect accelerated earnings? By that I mean, one year at 15%, next year at 17% and so on. Second question, sort of unrelated to that is on the TurboTax Live. How many returns did you actually report as assisted this year? And how does that compare with last year? And where do you think that number is going? Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Michael, thank you for your question. A couple of things. I would say, one, of course, we've provided guidance for the remainder of the year and we're very excited and pleased that we were able to raise our guidance. And we'll talk more at our Investor Day around guidance for not only FY '22, but one thing Michelle and I will do as we did last year is beyond guidance, just talk about our long-term expectation. So, I think I would say, let's wait till Investor Day to have the conversation beyond the fiscal year that we are in. In terms of TurboTax Live, we intentionally do not report the actual numbers in TurboTax Live other than just our growth rate. I would just reiterate that it is the fastest continues to be the fastest growing platform and products in the company. We're very pleased that it actually accelerated growth from last year on top of a very good year last year. And then majority of these customers are coming to us from the assisted category that are -- and one thing we're pleased about is, we had a growth of 100% of customers that are completely new to Intuit that came to TurboTax Live. So those are some of the stats and numbers that we've chosen to share publicly, and we'll look forward to sharing more at Investor Day. Michael Millman : Can I assume and roughly it's a wash so is coming from assisted to you on one hand offset of those going into assisted? Sasan Goodarzi : No, I wouldn't call it a wash at all. It's actually why we're able to grow our total pace base of customers year-after-year. So no, no it is not wash. And the metrics that I shared earlier, when you look the total number of IRS returns, our share of that total actually increased one point, which means that our base continues to increase. No, it is not a wash, it is an increase in share by Intuit. Michael Millman : Okay, thank you. Appreciate your information. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Josh Beck : Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask maybe a two parter team. One is around Credit Karma Money, certainly you had a really good progress. I think you offered 36 million direct deposits. I'm just wondering, how important is it for you to really translate that into maybe a regular payroll direct deposit, as you think about the strategy there? And a little bit related, just with the amount of momentum and success that you are already seeing with Credit Karma, does it maybe make you revisit the M&A aperture and maybe want to consider more of these larger transformative types of deals? Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Great, Josh. Thank you. First of all, I just want to clarify one thing to make sure it was not misinterpreted. We have the opportunity and made Credit Karma Money available to 36 million TurboTax customers. I don't want you all to interpret that as 36 million customers actually took us up on Credit Karma Money. I wish they did and our goal is they will over time, but I wanted to just make sure that that was clear. To the question that you asked, it's actually a great question, it gives me an opportunity to just very quickly paint a picture. And that is, I'll go back to what I shared earlier, which is the more we provide services and benefits to Credit Karma members, the more they will come back to the platform through our notifications, and the more they will engage with the services and the more we have an opportunity to actually present more products to them, and then over time, be able to monetize that to drive our revenue growth. So the power of Credit Karma Money is if you have a checking account, well, that's our savings account where you choose to take us off on direct payroll deposits, so we can give you early access to your paycheck. Not everything is necessarily about monetizing every single benefit, but the more we bring you back, the more than we can offer you, hey, Josh, we have a pre-approved credit card that's right for you, hey, Josh, it looks like you're paying ex for your auto insurance, we have an offer based on your driving habits to pay 20% less.  So it becomes truly the vision that I described earlier, which is a financial assistant in your pocket where we are in your corner, to try to help you reduce your debt and put more money in your pocket. So, we're not overly reliant on direct deposits by any means. But it just becomes another benefit and a reason to engage with the platform, which gives us opportunities to offer more products to you and then be able to monetize. To your last question about M&A, our principles around M&A are steadfast. We, of course have just based on some of the acquisitions we've made in the last several years and how well they've done we have a lot more confidence in our ability to execute, because we truly studied our history in the last 10-years, what went well, what didn't go well. And that's informed, I mean, a lot of our approaches today. And really it for us, everything is about speed to market. And so if there is talent we need to acquire, technology we need to acquire or capability like Credit Karma, those principles were informed decisions. And of course, our confidence has continued to grow, given the execution of the recent acquisitions. Josh Beck : Thanks so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, I'll be very brief. Thank you for your wonderful questions. And again, I want to thank our Intuit team and all of our partners for everything that they're doing to innovate for our customers. And we look forward to talking to you at our next earnings. Take care, everybody. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Latif. And I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Message]. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins. Kim Watkins : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi, and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There is a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon. Our Form 10-K for fiscal 2020 and our other SEC filings.  All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong fourth quarter capping off an outstanding year. Full-year revenue grew 25%, including the addition of Credit Karma. Total revenue growth was fueled by 16% growth for the small business in the Self-Employed Group and 14% growth for the Consumer Group. While Credit Karma had a very strong year, delivering another record quarter in Q4. Combined platform revenue, which includes QuickBooks Online, TurboTax Online, and Credit Karma grew 39% to 6.6 billion in fiscal year 2021. This includes 18 points from the addition of Credit Karma.  I'm proud of what the team has accomplished this year and our game plan to win remains durable. Let me now turn over to tax. This year marks our fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. We've built a durable strategy and we've made outstanding progress this year, with customer growth of 6% and our share of total returns up approximately 1 point. We extended our lead into the Do-It-Yourself category by focusing on underpenetrated segments, including investor customers, where we tripled the growth rate from last year. We continue to transform the $20 billion assisted segment with TurboTax Live, accelerating total customer growth by nearly 100%.  We have a highly predictable model and a platform with a significant runway for growth as we accelerate innovation. Recently, we announced plans not to renew our participation in the IRS refile program. We expect no impact on revenue from this decision. I want to make sure that you understand how this decision fits within our overall strategy. Free offerings are a critical part of our strategy to serve and grow with customers over time, offering benefits to power their prosperity. Intuit has delivered nearly 100 million free tax filings over the past eight years. And with nearly 90% of those free tax filings coming outside of the IRS refile program.  Looking ahead with no IRS refile program constraints, customers can enjoy all of the innovation we have to offer on our TurboTax, Credit Karma, and Mint platform. Our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 big bets are driving strong momentum and accelerating innovation across the Company. These big bets are focused on the largest problems our customers face and represent durable growth opportunities for Intuit. As a reminder, these big bets are; revolutionize speed to benefit, connects people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.  Today, I'll highlight the notable progress we've made this quarter on 3 of these big bets and will provide a detailed update on all 5 big bets at Investor Day next month. Our second big bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we're transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing 86 million filers who have previously relied on in-person assistance, the opportunity to access tax experts to help them do their taxes or complete their returns digitally.  This expertise provides confidence for consumers and creates the halo effect for our entire TurboTax experience. The TurboTax Live funnel was strong this season. Customer awareness grew over 20% and TurboTax Live customers new to Intuit grew more than 100%. Our full-service Do-It-For-Me offering attracted new customers from the assisted segment at a rate nearly 25% higher than our TurboTax Live Do-It - With -Me offering. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions with Credit Karma's data platform, and powerful network effects, we're making progress towards our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets, and access financial expertise and advice.  To deliver on this goal, all -- our strategic focus is to grow the core, including credit cards and personal loans, expand growth verticals, including home loans, auto loans, and insurance, and develop emerging verticals focused on digital money offerings, such as savings and checking accounts. Credit Karma also provides an additional monetization engine, increasing our combined wallet share with both free and paying customers. Credit Karma achieved another record high revenue quarter in Q4 with the number of members reaching a new all-time high, fueled partly by the TurboTax integration and monthly active users, and frequency of member visits remained strong. Within the core, credit card and personal revenue achieved another record high on a combined basis, reflecting an increase in transactions per member. The growth verticals also achieved an all-time revenue high, again, this quarter, reflecting strong momentum in auto insurance followed by home loans and auto loans. And we're developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money part of our digital money offering. Just this past month or just this month, we announced the integration of QuickBooks Online payroll to deliver a better checking experience for a portion of our Small Business employees that help them manage all aspects of their financials, all in one place.  These results are evidence that successful innovation drives Credit Karma members to the platform, creating more opportunities to connect them with products that are right for them, resulting in more monetization opportunities for Intuit. The all-time highs we achieved are driven by focused innovation in both bolstering our proprietary AI-powered Lightbox technology and investing in growth verticals, such as home and auto, as well as pent-up demand from our partners. Lightbox enables Credit Karma to present offers to the members who have a higher likelihood of approval.  Partners usage of Lightbox in Q4 is now at an all-time high with over 50% of credit cards and over 40% of personal loan transactions flowing through, versus less than 40% and 20% a year ago. This is the power of a network effect, solving a two-sided problem. We expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper this coming year after a very strong year of investments by our partners, returning to pre-COVID investment levels. I'm very pleased with our progress and excited about the upcoming innovations. I'll end my circling back to our first big bet, which is our foundational bet to revolutionize speed to benefit for our customers. Our goal is to put more money in our customers' pockets, eliminate friction, and deliver confidence at every touchpoint by using AI and customer insights.  This year, we accelerated our use of AI, increasing the number of models deployed across our platform by nearly 50%, saving our customers millions of hours of work. Our application of AI has dramatically increased the number of experiments we ran by more than 35% this year, made it easier for our TurboTax customers to never enter data, saving them millions of hours of manual entry and monetize our payroll offering, tripling release velocity. We are very pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plans to win, accelerated by digital tailwinds. Across all of our big bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. We will continue to invest aggressively, including in key talent to drive even faster innovation going forward. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion. GAAP operating income of $402 million versus $483 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $715 million versus $616 million last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.37 versus $1.68 a year ago. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.97 versus a $1.81 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the small business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 19% during the quarter and 16% in fiscal 2021. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 30% in the fourth quarter, and 26% for the year.  With the aim of being the source of trade for small businesses, our strategic focus within the small business and Self-Employed is three-fold. Grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 28% in fiscal Q4, driven mainly by customer growth, mix shift, and higher effective prices. Second, we continued to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes payments, payroll, time tracking, and capital, grew 35% in fiscal Q4.  Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Within payroll, we continued to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. During the quarter, we continued migrating customers to our new full-service lineup, which added approximately 5 points to online services growth. We're also seeing the number of employees per customer back to pre-pandemic levels. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of Online Ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q4.  Total international online revenue grew 47% on a constant currency basis. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 5% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single-digits in fiscal 2021. Consumer Group revenue grew 14% in fiscal 2021 above the high end of our longer-term expectation of 8% to 12%. Fiscal 2021 was the fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth for the Consumer Group. TurboTax units grew 6% this season. There are 4 primary drivers in our consumer business. Note that these metrics exclude approximately 8 million stimulus filings last season. This data reflects the season through July 31, 2021, versus the prior season through July 31, 2020. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS, which we estimate will be up approximately 3% this season, higher than our prior estimate of up, approximately 1%. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using Do-It-Yourself software.  We estimate the DIY category share of total IRS returns was down slightly this season, versus our prior estimate of approximately flat. The third driver is our share. Our share of total tax returns expanded, approximately 1 point to 31% this season, and our share of the DIY category grew approximately 1 point. Our total share excluding free fall customers this season was approximately 29%. The fourth is average revenue per return, which increased again this season. This growth reflects a stronger contribution by TurboTax Live and mix shifts to our premier offering, which is used by investors.  We estimate our retention rate rose slightly year-over-year, excluding filers seeking stimulus payments last season that didn't return again this season, and we're pleased with these results. Including these filers, we estimate total retention was down approximately 2 points. Turning to the ProConnect Group, we reported $517 million of revenue in fiscal 2021, up 5%. Moving onto Credit Karma, revenue was $405 million in Q4, another all-time high reflecting record highs for both the core and growth verticals. Sequential growth predominantly reflects strength in credit cards and personal loans as transactions per member increased. As Sasan shared earlier, we expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper sometime in Fiscal 2022, after a strong year of investment by our partners. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead for this platform. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform. These principles remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We returned excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.9 billion in cash investments from our balance sheet. We repurchased $467 million of stock during the fourth quarter and a billion dollars during fiscal 2021. The Board approved a new $2 billion repurchase authorization, giving us a total authorization of approximately $3.3 billion to repurchase shares.  Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share payable on October 18th, 2021. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, our full-year fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue of $11.05 billion to $11.2 billion, growth of 15% to 16%, including a full-year of Credit Karma. GAAP earnings per share of $7.46 to $7.66 and non - GAAP earnings per share of $11.05 to $11.25. We expect the GAAP tax rate of 20% in fiscal 2022. Note that our revenue guidance for Credit Karma of $1.345 billion to $1.38 billion translates into 18% to 21% growth if we had a full year of Credit Karma revenue during fiscal 2021. I'd like to provide some additional context around our operating margin expectations. As I've shared before, we continue to see opportunities to leverage the platform and drive margin expansion over time. However, our guidance implied GAAP operating margin declined just over 2 points in fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021. This reflects the impact of the Credit Karma acquisition along with investments we're making in stock compensation to attract and retain talent.  We are confident these are the right decisions to drive long-term growth. On a non-GAAP basis, our guidance implies operating margin in fiscal 2022 expands approximately 60 basis points. As I shared last quarter, fiscal 2021 was a very unique year, as we took a conservative approach to investments during the first half of the year when we were deep in the pandemic, and then the business started to bounce back more quickly than we anticipated in the second half. Our fiscal 2022 non-GAAP operating margin implies on average, a point of expansion each year since fiscal 2019.  Even though our initial guidance after closing the Credit Karma acquisition included a negative 2-point non-GAAP operating margin impact. We continue to see margin expansion opportunities ahead. Our Q1 fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue growth of 36% to 38% GAAP earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.19 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.94 to $0.99. You can find our full Q1 and fiscal 2020 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Super. Thank you, Michelle. I'm proud of the team and always accomplished together and I'm optimistic about the future. We have a large, addressable market with digital and tailwinds that include a shift to Virtual Solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities, and digital money offerings. With our strategy of becoming an AI-driven expert platform and five Big Bet s, we are positioned well for accelerated innovation and growth. Let's now open it up to your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on a great fiscal year. Sasan, in the press release, you guys called out sort of online payments and payroll as 2 really important growth factors for small businesses. I was wondering if you could just unpack this a little bit more. What are you seeing there and how sustainable do you think those trends are around those 2 parts of the offering? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you, Kirk. And good to hear from you. I will just take us back to several years ago when we talked about the importance of having a platform that really allows our customers to not only grow their business but to be able to manage their money and ensure that they are compliant.  And we've been heavily investing in payments, making it very easy for our customers to discover, making sure that we provide them with choice, accelerating our innovation in areas like instant deposit, getting paid upfront, those sorts of things.  And we -- that along with our investments in payroll, similar areas where we've really focused on making the experience far better, innovating in things like same-day payroll or next-day payroll, the shift of full-service where we have experts to help run your payroll and help you with your taxes, those are just of course two, very big and important illustrative examples where those innovations are really continuing to accelerate and beginning to pay off, especially in a time where we have digital tailwinds, where you have customers that are looking to move online, do more of their stuff online if they're already online. And that is starting to pan out when you look at our overall services revenue, whether it's payroll, payments, time tracking, all of those areas are contributing. And I think to your question, yes, this is sustainable. We are continuing to become that platform that customers look to, to be able to run their business. Our innovations are starting to pay off and we're not standing still.  Our innovations are in fact accelerating, and we would continue to expect that we'll be there for our customers and grow with them. And I think the last thing I would say, especially with our move into the mid-market where we're starting to serve larger customers, those are larger transactions and as we continue to penetrate non-consumption in the mid-market, we would continue to see that pay off. Kirk Materne : That's great. Maybe just one follow-up for Michelle on just the Credit Karma guide. I realize you guys called out the fact that there's a bit of pent-up demand in the back half this year, your fiscal year. How should we think about that in terms of just the cadence of the growth over the course of the year? Obviously, it's a little bit lumpy given we don't have full sort of year-over-year comps yet, but I was just kind of curious how we should maybe think about either first-half-year versus second half or any color around that would be helpful. Thanks. Michelle Clatterbuck : Hey, Kirk. Thanks for your question. Yes. We're pretty excited about Credit Karma as we continue to look forward. Q4 was just their all-time high for revenue. And so, we felt really good about that as we see strength in both credit cards and personal loans and transactions per member increasing.Yes, you're right. As you heard Sasan said, we did see some of the pent-up demand. We expect that will taper in Fiscal 2022, we had a pretty strong year of investment by our partners.  And so, we do expect that to return to more pre-COVID investment levels. As to how you might think about that across the year, there's not a whole lot of seasonality within CK. So, but we -- obviously, we haven't guided the individual quarters except for Q1. But we are pretty excited about what we see and we think there's still a lot of opportunity for Credit Karma next year. Kirk Materne : Super. Thanks very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Ken Wong : Great. Thank you for taking my question. And I echo the sentiments on the strong year. First, maybe just touching on the payroll. I think Michelle, you mentioned 5 points of growth contribution on the online services side. Should we think of this as a tough comp or would you say that we're still very early in driving adoption of full-service and we could potentially see this be additive longer-term? Michelle Clatterbuck : Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't sure if that was for me or you. Ken Wong : I think you or Sasan are more than qualified to answer that question. Sasan Goodarzi : I'd be happy to chime in and Michelle, please don't hesitate to jump in as well. First of all, I would just take you back to our longer-term expectations is to deliver 30% online revenue growth. And there's always going to be put and takes relative to payments and payroll and accounting revenue.  So please let your, sort of, uber compass be 30% online revenue growth. With that said, as I mentioned earlier, as I was answering Kirk's question, we are seeing the impact of our innovations pay off, and more and more of our customers are migrating to full-service payroll. More of our customers are actually wanting to get started on full-service payroll because of these capabilities that it has.  And it comes with expertise to help them solve the very problem that frankly is the biggest problem that is unsaid and that is about confidence. So, we have a runway ahead of us. Ken when it comes to payroll and I would just say your compass should be 30% online revenue growth. Ken Wong : Great. Got it. Fantastic. And then just a quick follow-up on the tax side. At a high level, any attempts to possibly share with some of the components of that 10% to 11% consumer growth is going to be coming from next year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Ken. And we'll, of course, unpack this to a more detailed level at our upcoming Investor Day. I would just tell you that I am delighted with our continued strategic progress and that will really feed into our future growth, which I think is the element of your question. When you think about our performance, I know I'm repeating some of the stats, but I think they're worth repeating.  One, we increased our total share of IRS returns by 1 point, the 2 areas that really matter most that we're focused on underpenetrated segments and transforming the assisted segments. We saw really superb results. Our overall investor volume tripled year-over-year. TurboTax Live awareness increased 20%. Our total customers grew 100%, our new customers to the franchise to TurboTax Live grew over 100%.  And with our full-service offering, it actually attracted new customers from the prior year assisted segment at a 25% higher rate than TurboTax Live Do-It-With-Me. And our retention rate stayed flat to a little bit up overall. So, when you look at all the key sort of metrics, knock on wood, it's very, very healthy and we expect that to inform next year's growth. And we do assume, by the way, that IRS returns are going to be about flattish next year.  So that's probably one important assumption that's worthwhile sharing. Though this is just a continuation as you've probably heard me say multiple times, we're on a 10-year plus run in these opportunity areas that we're focused on. And next year is just going to be another sort of important pivotal year in our quest to transform assisted and penetrated the underpenetrated segment. Ken Wong : Fantastic work guys. Sasan Goodarzi : Alright. Thank you, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Keith Weiss : Thanks. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and echo the congratulations. Really strong end to what was a pretty remarkable fiscal year for all the team at Intuit. I wanted to dig into the FY 22 guide a little bit, particularly around small businesses. Michelle, you've been talking about sort of a return to 30% plus growth in the Online Ecosystem side of the equation.  But if I'm doing my math right, and that's probably a big part of the equation here, if I could actually do the math. If I'm doing my math right, and we're growing online, 30% plus, that would imply with your guide that Desktop is actually now shrinking and down 10% in FY '22 or 10% plus.  Is something changing in Desktop or am I just doing my math wrong? Or sort of how should we think about that balance between sort of what had been a very durable sort of revenue stream in Desktop and a ramping online business? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hey, Keith. Thanks for your question. Well, first of all, I'd say we've been really excited about how Small Business has performed this year. And obviously, you can see with next year with our guide of 12% to 14%, we feel that it will be strong next year also.  We feel that you really need to continue to look at Online Ecosystem revenue growth. And we do expect that to be 30% or better over time. We haven't guided to it. We don't do it quarterly, but we do expect it to be there over the long term and being driven by the 10% to 20% gross number of customers on the ARPC. Now when I go to the other side, which you were asking about around Desktop. Desktop, we have over time, the last few years, we've seen some growth in it, and obviously, this past year in 2021, we saw 4% growth. But we do anticipate that that will just continue to decline over time. We've got more and more customers. As they come in, they choose the online versions and so you've got 8, 9 out of 10 customers that come in and choose QBO. So that's where I would help you with your math on that. Keith Weiss : Got it. And just to be clear, is there any kind of structural change in terms of trying to more aggressively shift people from the desktop version to the online version, or is this just sort of normal course business and this is the trend line that you've been seeing over time? Michelle Clatterbuck : We have -- we've chosen not to force people to move onto online. We do think that there is a much better value proposition, and they just have a much better experience if they're using our online products, but we want them to use whatever works for them. But we have seen more and more people as they choose Desktop, they are choosing the Plus product, where they have the subscription. And so that is part of what we've been seeing. Keith Weiss : Got it. Excellent. Thank you so much, guys. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Keith. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. I echo again all the congratulations that are in order. I wanted to start with just digging a little bit on Credit Karma since the growth is so much better than I think we've been modeling and anybody has really been thinking. I want to maybe unpack both in the quarter and also in the guidance, are you starting to see synergies that you're realizing whether it's monetizing you\u2019re -- the Intuit free user base with Credit Karma or whether it's cross-selling to the Karma base. And then I have a quick follow-up on the margins. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, Alex. Great to hear from you. Thank you for your kind comments. On Credit Karma, let me just -- I'll briefly start at the top in terms of what we are seeing. First of all, the accelerated innovation that we are seeing with Credit Karma is really paying off, and that accelerated innovation is how we're using our combined data to be able to deliver personalized experiences, leveraging Lightbox for our customers.  It's then ensuring that we're providing relevant offers to customers in the areas that they need it most. And now we can provide multiple relevant offers, whether it's cards, personal loans, auto insurance, home loans, and beyond.  But I think then more important than when they -- the offers in front of them, we have the ability to actually help them with the potential of their approval and make it very easy when they click to actually get the offers. So those are all critical areas of innovation that are really paying off. And I think it's a testament to the platform that when our partners decided to really go after customer acquisition, that they invested a good chunk of their dollars on the platform. And it just demonstrates the network effect than the power of the data and the trust of the members that we have. So that's the first element that we just believe will continue given our accelerated innovation, because our -- ultimately, our penetration rate, maybe one of the highest in credit cards. But it's one of the lowest when you look at auto insurance. So, we have so much room for increased wallet share. In terms of synergies, Alex, we are actually quite bullish about the possibilities for the future.  And I would want you to think about those synergies in the future, and there are really several areas of synergy. One is really making Credit Karma benefits part of the entire TurboTax experience. That's one big opportunity. The other big opportunity is making it seamless and contextual, in terms of TurboTax as part of the Credit Karma experience to be able to do your taxes.  And then third, what we just announced, which is Credit Karma being part of the payroll experience where our payroll customers can actually deposit their monies into a free checking and savings account and be able to access their money early over time if they wish.  So those are significant opportunities because they're -- you're talking about millions and millions of TurboTax customers, payroll customers, and of course, over -- well over a 100 million Credit Karma customers that we're going to launch TurboTax to. This past year, and as I'll remind us, it feels like a long time, but we just closed Credit Karma in December. These past eight months, we have been experimenting with incredible purpose, incredible speed, and incredible intention. And it's informed what we are rolling out and what we're doing in the year to come. I would just say in terms of those things turning into material customer revenue growth, there -- we're not counting on that in the near-term, we're counting on that more on the mid-term because we want to really continue to nail the experience in creating ecosystem benefit across all of our members. So that's the way I would want you to think about not only what you're seeing in Credit Karma, but the growth rates that are ahead of us. Alex Zukin : That's super-clear. And I appreciate the level of detail in that answer, Sasan. Michelle, maybe for you, I know myself, I was dealing with a lot of questions around margin leverage potential on the guide and versus the level of investment that you guys clearly see as an opportunity in the business but I think you've delivered -- I think it was your best incremental operating margin leverage guide in the last few years, at least.  So, I want to unpack both what you're trying to tell us with the ability to deliver both growth and margin leverage at this scale. Unpack it if you can, from a gross margin versus OpEx savings perspective. I know I remember a few years ago there was fear with lives, particularly coming into the model that it would be gross margin dilutive, and yet, the gross margin has actually improved this year. So, I want to understand a little bit about when you think about that incremental margin leverage, where is it coming from and how should we think about the durability of that opportunity? Michelle Clatterbuck : Great question, Alex. Thank you. First of all, thank you for acknowledging the margin delivery we have this year. You mentioned gross margin and we have continued to say that we expect gross margin to remain fairly flat over time. You're right, we did have a lot of questions as we got into the TurboTax Live businesses as to whether that was going to deteriorate margins. But it has remained flattish over time. I mean, that was the last expectation we gave that I gave last year at Investor Day. And our big focus is obviously on margin, and we see the opportunity there and continue to see opportunities to drive margin leverage really as we become more and more of a platform Company. FY 21 was a little unique, in that with the pandemic and full swing at the beginning, we weren't exactly sure how -- exactly how things are going to play out and we were a little bit more conservative with investments. And then the business ended up bouncing back much more quickly than we thought.  So, as I mentioned earlier, when you look over all the way back from 2019, we've got about on average a point of margin expansion. And so, we feel really good about that, and especially with our guide looking forward to 60 basis points.  So, when I think about where we'll see the expansion, though it is really all across the business is helping us drive it, getting leverage, whether it's in technology, and looking at how we can get rid of duplicate technology and use services more, whether it's in customer success and really leaning into a platform there to deliver for all our customers or opportunities we have in our go-to-market and enabling additional technology there. So, we do think that we continue to have opportunities to drive that leverage. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Great job. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Alex. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies, your line is open. Brent Thill : Sasan, if you could expand on the Small Business side and what you're seeing on the international approach and the traction beyond the U.S. and how critical that is to this next year for you. And maybe just a quick follow-up for Michelle on QuickBooks Live, if you can give us an update in terms of traction and any trend lines you're seeing there. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Brent, just a follow-up question. The last question that you asked about trend lines, were those just general trend lines that we're seeing in small businesses? I want to make sure we captured your question correctly. Brent Thill : More specifically the QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Live. My apologies, QuickBooks Live. Sasan Goodarzi : Got it. Okay. Great. So, let me start with your question about the international. First of all, as I mentioned in the last earnings call, and I think the same trend continues. One thing that's unchanged is small businesses across the globe are still recovering. Some have recovered to -- back to pre-COVID levels. Some have actually accelerated their business because they changed the model. But at least what we see in our data, 20% ish of small businesses are still struggling. And struggling is defined by, they have -- their net deposits are down over 25%. So, I think it's important just as a general perspective to recognize that small businesses are in general still in recovery mode. With that said, our platform has become more critical than ever. And the digital nature of our platform to be able to run your business, grow your business, manage your cash flow, and be compliant is more important than ever, which is why, based on our innovation, overall, we're seeing this acceleration.  And then if I put that in the context of geography, I would say the U.S. has really bounced back in terms of the usage of our platform and, in fact, an acceleration probably above all, it's happened in the U.S. I would say Canada is sort of next in terms of recovery. And I would just put countries like the UK, France, Australia as really being much, much slower in the recovery. And really the reason is as you've seen, there's a lot of open, shutdown, open, shutdown and that's really impacted just a sentiment of both accountants and small businesses. But even in that context, it's actually quite exciting that we delivered 47% revenue growth in constant currency last quarter and 43% for the whole year. But with that said, we're assuming a much slower recovery international than we are in the U.S. because I think it's just really important that we get out of this health crisis. And then once we do, we believe the small businesses will bounce back much, much faster outside the U.S. International is still important for our future, but what I just shared is just how we've taken that into account strategically in both economically and our guidance as we look ahead. And maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Michele to answer your QuickBooks Live question. Michelle Clatterbuck : Great. Hey, Brent, I would say we're continuing to make some progress with QuickBooks Live. It actually goes back to what I mentioned earlier on, the opportunities for platform leverage because it's actually built on the same platform as TurboTax Live. And that's what enabled us to bring it to market so much more quickly.  Right now, we're still focused on achieving product-market fit. Seeing some early signs here is a way to bring in customers who are new to Intuit, to help us with customer acquisition. And we do think that there is a great opportunity for us to use the live product, to help penetrate non-consumption, which as you know, is a huge opportunity. The pandemic over this last year has really been an opportunity as we've seen the acceleration to a virtual world. And so, obviously, customers are much more anxious to or much more open to using these types of experiences. And so, our platform really enables that. It does solve one of the biggest problems we have with Small Business customers, which is confidence. You also see that on the TurboTax side too. Expert interest has continued to remain really strong. And so that has been a good thing for us to see.  A few customer pains point we're currently working on are on solving, streamlining, and automating document collection. And then enabling messaging within the offerings so customers can more easily communicate with their bookkeeper. And then the last thing I'd say is last year we launched the setup queue so that we could really help small businesses come in, get set up on QuickBooks, and have that confidence right from the get-go. And we've seen some good success with that. Brent Thill : Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Brad. Operator : Next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much. Congratulations on an exciting finish to the fiscal year. Sasan, I wanted to get your thoughts on the Small Business ecosystem, as you look at the business, a few years out, and it looks like, clearly, the Company is having increasing success with payroll and payments. But I'm curious with the added juice with the small businesses perpetually underspent on IT, but that could be changing with digital transformation. So, as you move slightly upmarket and Small Businesses and land bigger deals with QuickBooks Advanced. What are the things that you're learning about that part of the market that shoots into it particularly well, given that you got a wide range of assets, AI, Credit Karma et cetera? So how do you bring those assets to bear in a way that you can get a big chunk of the IT spending that is -- that could potentially be unleashed into the higher end, as you move upmarket in the small business ecosystem? Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Great question, Kash. And great to hear from you. I'll take you back to the bet that we have declared, which is we truly want to be the center of Small Business growth. And for us, it's really about helping customers grow their business.  It's helping our customers manage all of their money flow, and it's also ensuring that they can take good care of their employees and be compliant. And I think particularly, there are two areas to answer your question as we move upmarket, but it's also relevant.  One of them is very relevant to just smaller businesses that we're continuing to focus on. And that is one, how do we help you grow your business? That's both relevant to the businesses that we serve today, but also very relevant to the mid-market customers and so to be able to manage your marketing, your sales, your services, is one element. I think the other element, which is particularly important for mid-market customers is just all their GNA.  And we believe that the live platform that we've created, the engines that we've created will actually help us go beyond bookkeeping, taxes, and accounting to be able to focus on some of their -- and how they run their business and particularly the live GNA. So those are the two areas. Kash Rangan : Wonderful. Thank you so much. Congrats. Sasan Goodarzi : All right. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for taking my question and I will say my congratulations for a great end to this challenging year. Sasan, I want to ask you about a follow-up on your TurboTax, mainly TurboTax Live full-service. This is the first-year you guys launched. So, I'm wondering, what have you learned this year? And hopefully next season, maybe we'll go back to normalcy so what's your expectation back into guidance in terms of adoption of full-service? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Hi, Siti. And thank you for your kind words. I would just start with really, this has been a very intentional multiyear effort to have one platform across TurboTax, where you can do your taxes yourself. You can get assistance to do your taxes or we'll do your taxes for you. And a platform where you can choose to go back and forth within the year or in a multiyear period, we want to be the platform for your taxes and of course, obviously beyond that, with the capabilities that we have with Credit Karma.  The second element, I would say is what we learned this year, going to full launch, is that full-service offering has a halo effect and build confidence for customers, which is why we were able to attract new customers from the prior assisted method at a 25% higher rate into full-service because they know that they can digitally provide us all of their data. And we have excellent experts to be able to take very good care of them. So that's the biggest learning that we had.  It was a hypothesis that we have from prior-year experimentation and we're going to continue to scale that as we look ahead. It's just a very critical part of our platform. And as I've said before, we believe that we're in the very, very early innings of a 10-year plus opportunity here. And we just see full-service playing a very important role as we look ahead. Siti Panigrahi : That's great. Thank you, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Congratulations from me too. 2 tax questions. The first one, Sasan, if you could, I guess, use this opportunity to describe a little bit more the decision process to exit Free File Alliance, and then I think you and Michelle mentioned, should not have a revenue impact. I'm just curious, any thoughts on margin impact for the go-forward? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure. Thank you. Scott, good to hear from you. First of all, just as a reminder, we were one of the founding members of the Free File Alliance program with the IRS and it has been frankly, an incredible partnership with the IRS and the private industry. And when we really founded this program with the IRS, there were really two goals. And I'll simplify it. The two goals were, we wanted at that time, to ensure that electronic filing was used by more than 80% plus of all consumers. And we wanted to make sure that free filing was available to 80% plus of consumers. And when you forward the clock, mission accomplished on both, in fact, we've exceeded both metrics as an industry on both fronts. And Free has now become prevalent across the entire industry. And so, we felt that the time was right now that the mission has been accomplished to really change our approach to how we can deliver benefits for customers. Free will always be an important part of the strategy, but there are constraints when you come in through the Free File Alliance program and those constraints are, for instance, we can't provide you benefits on other platforms, like our free Credit Karma platform.  And so, as we look ahead, not only will we be able to provide free tax offerings to our customers, but as they grow and we grow with them, they can benefit from Credit Karma, they can benefit from Mint. If they are a small business, they can benefit from QuickBooks, things that we ultimately couldn't talk to them about if they were part of the Free File Alliance program. So, mission accomplished and that's the reason why we chose to get out. I just want to state again, the partnership with the IRS has absolutely been phenomenal and with private industry to achieve the goals of FFA. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks, and just any thoughts on the margin on the gulf [Indiscernible] -- Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. My apologies, I failed to answer that. No impact to margins, no impact to revenue, and some of the resources actually were that -- were on FFA, we're reallocating them to really important work in TurboTax. So, there's no impact. Scott Schneeberger : Understood. And just a real quick follow-up from an earlier question, you mentioned a flattish IRS industry growth anticipated for next year. Is that because we saw what looks like 3% this year in just the top comp or any other factors that go into that entry space. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Scott, I'll just start with it's an assumption, we make an assumption every year. So, what we think it will be because it's important for our planning. And because there have been two years of pretty strong total return growth, we're just assuming next year is going to be flat. We could be wrong, it could grow, but our assumption going in is it's flat. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Absolutely, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turin of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Michael Turrin : Hey, there. Thanks. Good afternoon. And congrats on the strong results of the year. Going back to Credit Karma, I'm just wondering if there's anything you can add around how much visibility you have there in framing targets for the upcoming year relative to other segments of your business? I think the commentary is clear around the Q4 strength, but just wondering how to pass through the 18% to 21% growth you referenced, which is a solid starting point, and the guidance is modestly down relative to the run rate that segment just delivered. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Michael, and thank you for it. I know you've been waiting for a while in the queue here. We have very good visibility and I'll just be specific. We have well over 100 million customers. We see the monthly active users, which has grown quite nicely. We actually, based on the data that we have and how we are leveraging that data with our customer's permission as part of Lightbox and the number of partners that come into Lightbox, we actually can see spend behavior. We can see our customer's activity.  We can see their financial situations and are continued to be better positioned to be able to offer them products that are right for them. So, when we see our member growth, when we see our member activity, the number of transactions, which is the number of offerings that we now have, the activity of our partners, which we're very engaged with because our partners see this platform as a great growth opportunity for them.  And the fact that we continue to be very intentional, that we are an agnostic platform. We have pretty good visibility into the future with Credit Karma. And we feel, of course, good and confident about the guidance that we provided. Michael Turrin : That's so helpful. Thanks for [Indiscernible] Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Sasan, I believe earlier in the call you talked about retention rates in TurboTax being flat year-over-year. What types of things have to happen to see that tick up? Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Brad. Good to hear from you. First of all, with all of the movement in the last couple of years with the pandemic and the growth that we've experienced, we're actually quite pleased with the retention rates. And I would tell you the biggest lever around retention is what we are doing with TurboTax Live, which is ensuring that our customers know and understand that there is an expert to help them every step of the way. But I think secondly, and we haven't talked much about this and we'll spend a little bit of time on this at Investor Day, is how we are now leveraging data to never lose the customer. And I give a lot of credit to our TurboTax team where we've been working on this for several years.  It's not a new body of work, but the shift from just engaging you once a year when it's tax time, to actually understanding and leveraging what we know about you. If something has changed in your life if you bought a house if you bought a car if you got married if you got divorced if you move from one state to another. It's actually engaging you year-round relative to giving your confidence that those changes can be addressed by us. So, it's the combination of leveraging data, applying AI for that data with our models to understand who could be at risk, and then engaging those customers proactively. And by the way, depending on their needs, not just with TurboTax, it could also be engaging them with the benefits of Credit Karma. Those are the two big things, data, and AI, and the capabilities of TurboTax Live, engaging customers year-round, where we are quite confident over the long term, we can continue to increase our retention rates. Brad Reback : And then just one quick follow-up. High level, any sense of why DIY went backward this year? Sasan Goodarzi : Brad, the numbers are so wonky. What happened the last couple of years, I think so many people that don't have to file their taxes came in to do their taxes to get a stimulus check. And so, what really matters are some of the underlying numbers that we provided, and the fact that we gained share overall, IRS returns and within DIY, even though DIY went down. But it's just a wonkiness of the number of stimulus customers that came in that ultimately didn't have to file their taxes again this year. So that's the reasoning as we look at all the cohorts. Brad Reback : Great, makes total sense. Thanks very much. Sasan Goodarzi : All right, Brad. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Jackson Ader : Great. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. The first one is on the Credit Karma site where you're expecting maybe to see some of the pent-up demand return to more normal levels. We're just curious whether that is more driven on the -- in the core markets or some of the emerging markets? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you, Jackson. It's primarily originations in credit cards and personal loans. One data point is public, the other one is in our own data that we see. They're up double-digits strongly compared to pre-COVID levels. And we believe those are just going at some point taper. in the back half of the year, and it's primarily from what we see in credit cards and personal loans.  And it's really our innovation on the platform that will continue the guidance growth that we provided of 18% to 21%. But it's really in credit cards and personal loans that we believe originations will go back to pre - COVID levels, which were strong, it's just there was pent-up demand so it grew to double-digits. Jackson Ader : Okay. Perfect. And then a follow-up, Michelle, the TurboTax Premier skew, I think is better than maybe you would be expected the entire year. Can you just remind us, what does Premier's retention rate look like relative to maybe the overall TurboTax platform? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hey, Jackson, thanks for the question. Premier, we've done a good amount of work on Premier last couple of years. It's specifically used by our investors. And so obviously we've continued to see the growth that's one of the underpenetrated segments that we've focused on. We have not provided any detailed information on our retention rates below the higher level for TurboTax, so that's just not an area that we really delved into, just because of the competitive nature. Jackson Ader : All right, fair enough. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Jackson. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills of Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Great. Thanks, guys. And I'll echo the congratulations on a real nice finish to the year. One of the things that stands out to me is the outlook for small businesses, very strong relative to kind of how you provide outlook heading into the year historically. So, my question is, is there a price increase in there and just more generally as you think longer term, historically, the Company has raised price commensurate with more value that's delivered in the product for QuickBooks, how do you feel about your ability to just monetize more of the market with just more value-added features coming over the long-term? What are some of those things that you think might enable you to take price over time? Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Brad, for your question and your kind words. Let me make a couple of comments. One, the -- really are the majority of our growth is coming from customer growth and mix. And when I say mix, it's for instance, QuickBooks Advanced, which goes after the mid-market type mix. It's really not driven by price, although we have increased price this year and it's the first time, we've done it in over the last couple of years. And I'd tell you that we run tests and it's exactly as you said, it's -- we look at the price-value equation. We have very clear pricing principles. And with experimentation and data, we choose when to move forward with the price increase. And I would tell you that our innovation, just in the last couple of years, literally last year, our innovation across the Company, which includes small business, doubled year-over-year in terms of -- and we measure that by code deployment and impact, and it's doubled again this year. And that shows up in how we leverage data and AI across the platform to deliver insights to customers. It shows up in payments and payroll and time tracking. And then what we've announced, which is moving upmarket several years ago with QuickBooks advance, it's being able to serve product-based businesses with QuickBooks commerce.  It's being able to go after non-consumption with QuickBooks Live, which is a higher sort of price tag for our customers. And then our disruptive offering with QuickBooks Cash, which is, in essence, you can start with a business bank account and be able to run your business through that. So just the innovation is I would just say staggering, focused on cohorts of customers and going after their needs, and with an open platform, we're able to really focus on what matters more to customers and monetize. So, we believe that capability is one that we'll have for years to come. Brad Sills : That's great. Thanks so much, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Thank you, Brad. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Pfau : Hey, guys, thanks for fitting me in. Just wanted to ask one question on the Small Business segment, and specifically around some of the key metrics there, like gross to customer additions, charge volumes, employees, and under payroll, have you seen any change in some of those key metrics you track as COVID variants have started to impact various spots of the U.S. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Matt, thank you for your question. The short answer is no. We're continuing to see strength by industry, by geography, given some of the tailwinds and our innovation that I spoke about earlier. So, with the Delta variant being the primary driver of the COVID cases and what we're seeing in different states within the U.S. having a different impact, we've really not seen an impact in our results in charge volume, the number of employees, so the strength remains. Matt Pfau : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open. Michael Millman : Thank you. So, a couple of questions. On this year's -- on next year's guidance or I guess, this year's guidance, is that lowest seeming number related to your conservatism on last year's guidance? And what should we expect over 2 years to the 3-year range? And secondly, on last year's -- or this current year's tax, to what extent did you have assisted benefit from people misunderstanding or concerned about the stimulus and wanting to sit down? And it was a one-year phenomenon. And we go back to reduced assisted and increasing Do-It-Yourself. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Michael, for your question. A couple of things. I'll start with your first question. We're very excited about the innovation across the Company. The customer segments we're pursuing, and the impact of that, that we are seeing. And in that context, we feel very good about our guidance and long-term expectations. This gets to the second question, and that is the long term, what we'll do at Investor Day, as we do every year, is we'll share our long-term expectations. So, we'll talk about that at Investor Day.  So, if you wouldn't mind maybe waiting another 3 weeks, we'll talk about that a little bit more. And the third part of your question around tax and assistance and do we have a blip from the pandemic, I would say the short answer is really no. This year, a lot of our -- a lot of accountants and stores were actually open. I think what you're seeing here is just it's the impact of our innovation, it's raising the awareness that we have live expertise available for customers, whether we do it with you or do it for you. And in that context, this was not a blip because of the pandemic. If anything, most places were actually open and this was just based on our strategy and the results of our execution. Michael Millman : Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : You're very welcome. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen. I'm not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you. Well, thank you very much for the wonderful questions and I want to just thank our employees, our customers, and our partners for another great quarter and I wish all of you to be safe out there and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating, and this concludes today's conference call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Latif and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit 's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins. Kim Watkins : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit 's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. On here with Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit 's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2021, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com.  We assume no obligation to update any Forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I will turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thanks, Kim. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're off to a strong start in fiscal year 2022 with continued momentum across the Company, given our strategy of becoming a global AI-driven expert platform, powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses. We have nearly a $300 billion addressable market driven by digital tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities, and digital money offerings. First quarter revenue grew 52%, including 32 points from the addition of Credit Karma. Total revenue growth was fueled by small business and self-employed group revenue growth of 22%, and Credit Karma revenue of $418 million, another record quarter. Consumer Group and ProConnect Group revenue was in line with our expectations in a seasonally small quarter. As a result, both of our strong start to the year and the close of Mailchimp transaction, we are raising our revenue and non-GAAP operating income and earnings-per-share guidance for fiscal year 2022. Michelle will cover this in detail later. Our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation and our 5 Big Bets for solving the largest problems are customers states face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well-positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are revolutionized speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. I am extremely proud of the momentum we are seeing with Credit Karma. Credit Karma is a data platform with powerful network effects, solving a two-sided problem. We are focused on our goal of creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets, and access financial experts and insights. Credit Karma achieved record high revenue again in Q1. We continue to deliver innovation across all verticals fueled by our proprietary Lightbox platform, enabling personalized experiences for our members, creating a network effect. Within the core, partners ' usage of Lightbox reached all-time highs across both credit cards and personal loans.  Lightbox more than doubled the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma. Within the growth verticals, we're solving a larger set of financial challenges for consumers. Karma Drive is giving U.S. members the opportunity to see if they can save money on auto insurance with usage-based pricing. We're actively exploring expansion opportunities with Lightbox in other verticals, including auto loans, building off of the success as we've seen in credit cards and personal loans. Within the emerging verticals, we remain focused on innovation with Credit Karma money. We integrated Credit Karma money into TurboTax last season and experimented with how we could best meet our customers ' needs and announced an integration with QuickBooks Online Payroll. Given our learnings, we are excited about launching our improved experiences in the upcoming tax season. We believe Credit Karma Money is the key to driving growth in frequency of visits over time, one of the many key drivers of average revenue per monthly active user. Zooming out, we continue to grow members and are focused on building trust by delivering personalized financial products right for members, helping members save money, pay down debt, and get faster access to their money while providing insight and advice. Over time, we're creating a virtual cycle, which we expect to increase the frequency of engagement, transaction, and monetization across our ecosystem.  Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggled with cash flow and we are continuing to innovate to create solutions for customers to overcome this challenge. In fiscal year 2021, total payments volume on our platform grew 40% year-over-year to over $90 billion. An online payment volume grew more than 60% driven by an increase in customer using our payments offering. As we continue to innovate for our customers and payments, those using QuickBooks cash of nearly 3 times higher engagement compared to customers who've just used QuickBooks Online. To accelerate engagement and usage of our platform, we recently introduced Get Paid Upfront, a game - changing innovation that will help qualified customers get paid soon after their invoice is set. Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advance. We're seeing strong traction with QBO Advance, with customers growing to 118,000 in fiscal year 2021, up 57% year-over-year. As we continue to move up-market and serve these customers most critical needs, we're seeing a services ecosystem ARPC that is 4x higher than the ARPC for QBO customers. We're pleased with our results and remain confident in our game plans to win. Across all of our Big Bets, we're building momentum and accelerating innovation, which we believe positions us well for durable growth in the future. This will be further fueled the by Mailchimp. I'm delighted that we closed Mailchimp.  They closed the acquisition earlier this month, which seeks to significantly accelerate 2 of our Big Bets, bet: to be the center of small business growth, and to disrupt the small business mid-market. Getting and engaging customers remains a significant paying-point for small and mid-market businesses. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First priority is to deliver on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform to help customers get their business online, market their business, manage their customers ' relationships, get paid, access capital, pay employees, manage cash flow, and be compliant with virtual experts at their fingertips, all in one place. Second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM, and e-commerce suite for mid-market customers at an attractive price point, enabling mid-market customers to use the power of the platform to grow their business.  And third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. With Mailchimp now part of the Intuit family, we are uniquely positioned to enable small and mid-market businesses to combine their customer data from Mailchimp and purchase data from QuickBooks to deliver actionable insights they need to grow and run their businesses with confidence. This is where the real magic happens. Our combined platform technology enables us to move with speed, and we've already seen strong interest from our customers. The teams are hard at work, and we are excited about the opportunity ahead. Foundational to our Company's success is building a high-performance culture. I want to take a moment to acknowledge our progress with our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Last year, we declared our focus on increasing the percentages of women in technology roles and underrepresented minorities across our business. We achieved 30% and 13% respectively and we are inspired to accelerate our plans and push even harder as much work remains to be done. Additionally, we've made meaningful progress supporting our communities. First, we recently announced the Intuit Climate Action Marketplace, which will help 1 million U.S. small businesses find sustainable solutions to reduce carbon emissions. This is part of our decade-long climate positive goal to go beyond net carbon neutral and reduce global carbon emissions by 2 million metric tons by 2030, or 50 times greater than our 2018 operational footprint. We also recently announced a 23-year partnership with the Los Angeles Clippers that includes economic benefits for the local community with Intuit Dome, the team's future home.  And finally, we launched Intuit Ventures to invest in the startup community and accelerate FinTech innovation for consumers and small businesses. All the work we do starts with our mission of powering prosperity around the world. And I'm proud of the momentum across the Company and delivering on that mission for our customers and communities. Now let me hand it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. Good afternoon, everyone. And I'd also like to welcome the Mailchimp team to Intuit. Now, let me turn to the results. For the first quarter of Fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2 billion, GAAP operating income of a $195 million versus $209 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $555 million versus $334 million last year, GAAP-diluted earnings per-share of $0.82 versus $0.75 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of a $1.53 versus $0.94 last year. Note that our GAAP results include a $39 million net gain on other long-term investments. Turning to the business segments; in the small business and self-employed group, revenue grew 22% during the quarter, with online ecosystem revenue up 36%. With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within small business and self-employed is three-fold, grow the Core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the Core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 32% in fiscal Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem.  Online services revenue, which includes payroll, payments, capital, and time-tracking, grew 42% in fiscal Q1. Within Payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in Payroll customers, and the mix shift to our full-service offerings. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth, along with an increase in charge volume per customer. Third, our progress expanding globally added to the growth of online ecosystem revenue during fiscal Q1. Total international online revenue grew 39% on a constant currency basis. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 7% in the first quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew high-single digits, driven by strong customer growth and price increases we put in place late last year. As a reminder, this fall we transitioned to a subscription model for this year's Desktop offering, which we expect to be a headwind to revenue growth in the second half of the year. We expect the Desktop business to decline longer-term. Moving onto Credit Karma, revenue was $480 million in Q1, another record revenue quarter, driven by high levels of monthly active users and revenue per monthly active user. Within the core, we saw another record quarter, driven by the combined strength in personal loans and credit cards. The growth verticals also achieved another strong quarter, reflecting momentum in home loans and auto loans. And we're developing the emerging vertical by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma money, part of our digital money offering, so this is not a large revenue driver today. We continue to expect pent-up demand across the core verticals to taper sometime in the second half of fiscal 2022 after a strong year of investment by our partners. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Consumer Group revenue of $120 million in Q1 was in line with our expectations. Looking ahead to the upcoming tax season, we continue to focus on our strategy to expand our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. As to the ProConnect Group, revenue of $26 million in the quarter was also in line with our expectations. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double-digits, and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As I've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on becoming an AI-driven expert platform.  These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product roadmap. We returned excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. On November 1st, we entered into a $4.7 billion term loan under our new credit arrangement at credit agreement to partially fund the Mailchimp acquisition. We repurchased $339 million during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share payable January 18th, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2022 revenue and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance to reflect both the acquisition of Mailchimp and the stronger than expected start to the year in the small business and self-employed group and Credit Karma. Our updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue up $12.165 billion to $12.3 billion, growth of 26% to 28%, including Mailchimp as of November 1st and a full-year of Credit Karma. Excluding Mailchimp, revenue grows of 18% to 20% up from our prior guidance of 15% to 16%, GAAP earnings per share of $7 to $7.16, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.48 to $11.64.  This updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes organic growth for the small business and self-employed segment of 16% to 17%, up from 12% to 14%, expected Mailchimp revenue of $760 million to $770 million, and Credit Karma revenue of $1.54 billion to $1.565 billion, up from $1.345 billion to $1.38 billion. As I shared before, we continue to see opportunities to leverage the platform and drive margin expansion over time. Excluding Mailchimp, our non-GAAP operating income guidance continues to imply approximately 60 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal 2022. Our guidance assumes the Mailchimp transaction is accretive to Intuit 's non-GAAP earnings per share in full-year fiscal 2022.  However, we expect an approximate 80 basis points onetime step-down in non-GAAP operating margin reflecting the impact of Mailchimp as we plan to invest aggressively in the business. We expect non-GAAP operating margin expansion to continue from this new level over time in line with our financial principles. Our fiscal 2020 GAAP operating income guidance includes approximately $165 million for stock-based compensation associated with the acquisition of Mailchimp.  In addition, our GAAP operating income guidance includes the impact of the Credit Karma acquisition along with investments we are making in stock compensation to attract and retain talent. We're confident these are the right decisions to drive long-term growth. And we expect a GAAP tax rate of 18% in fiscal 2022. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 includes revenue growth of 73% to 74%. GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 to $0.59 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.84 to $1.88. You can find our full Q2 and updated fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Michelle. We are off to a strong start this year with continued momentum across the Company, given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform that's powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. I'm proud of what our employees have accomplished this quarter and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to find new innovative ways to serve our more than 100 million customers. Now let's open it up to your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim. Your question, please. Ken Wong : Great. Thank you so much. Sasan, the success of Lightbox has been very impressive. Just wondering, is there a way to quantify where we are in terms of adoption of Lightbox within that your core credit vertical and what that potential adoption could look like? And then you touched on expanding into other verticals. What verticals do you think are appropriate to integrate into Lightbox? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Ken, thanks for the question. In terms of Lightbox, as we talked about it at Investor Day, we've actually made significant progress year-over-year in terms of penetration. I think what we talked about at Investor Day is we had 50% and 40% penetration in credit cards and personal loans compared to, I think, 40, 20 a year before. One, we have significant penetration opportunity ahead of us. I think equally as important, if not more, is what financial institutions are seeing, which is really the payoff for their investments. And so, more and more financial institutions are joining the platform and this gives us, really, an opportunity to significantly increase penetration.  I think that's the way I would probably give you the punch line. Our penetration in credit cards is, I think, less than 5%, just as an example, and personal loans and other verticals are even lower than that. So, Lightbox, the trust we build with our members, the trust we are building with our partners gives us an opportunity for significant penetration, and I think are sort of best years are ahead of us when you think about Lightbox and particularly a penetration. In terms of your question around expansion, auto loans are just one example of where we can expand Lightbox and there are other areas that we've not talked about publicly. I won't do it today until we see our further proof points where we can further expand Lightbox. I think this is 13 years of investments that now positions us to really deliver for members, partners, and really create this network effect. Ken Wong : Got it. Fantastic. Appreciate the color. And then, if I could sneak one in for you, Michelle. When I look at that Mailchimp number 760, 770, any way to help us understand what that growth might have looked like on a three-quarter basis versus last year? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Ken. Yeah. We're really excited about Mailchimp. And we think that we're going to do some great things together. Their revenue and their new paying user growth were negatively impacted during the pandemic. I would let to know that. And they did pull back on some of their marketing spend so they could preserve their profitability, and we did see their churn decline some there too. We're going to be investing aggressively to drive their growth as we go forward. It won't happen overnight, but we're really excited about the opportunities we see to grow as we look forward. We haven't really given any additional details on what their growth was previously. Ken Wong : Okay. Understood. Thank you very much, Michelle. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : I just want to thank you guys for taking the question and really impressive quarter across the board. It is -- there's really nothing to pick on in here. I wanted to dig into the QuickBooks Online business a little bit. Both sort of the subscriptions and the online services boasting acceleration in the quarter. Can you help us understand how much of that is the continued reflation post the calendar '20 macro impacts, and how much comes from just fundamentally improving attach rates? I know you guys are focusing on higher level customers with QBO Advanced. Is that starting to improve your overall attach rate picture in that business? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Keith, thanks for the question. I would say the majority, if not all, compared to previous quarters, is simply customer growth. Its improved mix based on the traction of QuickBooks Advance, QuickBooks Live to a lesser degree, and things like full-service Payroll, and just all the innovation we've been doing in payments with instant deposit making it easier to use our payments offering, and now our new launch with Get Paid Upfront. So, I would say the majority of what we're starting to experience is the actual innovation on the platform and the portfolio that we have solving a broad range of needs for our customers. I would say bounce back from the pandemic, of course, happened and we started experiencing the pickup, but that was, I would say, 4 to 6 months ago. I think now we're seeing the actual true performance of the platform. Keith Weiss : Outstanding. And then maybe a follow-up from Michelle. You called out again the potential impacts on the Desktop business from a shift towards subscription. Any way you can help us quantify what those impacts are going to be? Michelle Clatterbuck : Hey, Keith. What I can tell you about Desktop is, obviously, we saw the 7% growth in the Ecosystem in first quarter. And that was really driven by 2 different components. The majority of it was 2 components. First was we saw higher Desktop Enterprise customer growth and some price increases. Desktop Enterprise revenue growth was high single-digits in Q1. The other half of that is really the Desktop subscriber mix. Last year, what we saw was Desktop subs grew 48%, and outright units declined by 47%. And so, that growth in subs last year, because of the way we do revenue recognition, you get an extra pop of revenue from subscriber growth in the -- in Q1. And so that is what we saw. We do expect to see some headwinds for that growth as we go further out through the rest of the year, especially with all the subscriber growth instead of an outright. Keith Weiss : Got it. All right. Thank you, guys. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Chirag Ved : Hi, this is Chirag Ved on for Kirk. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the great quarter. I know it's still early days, but can you talk a little bit about the plan for the go-to most -- go-to-market with Mailchimp? For example, are you planning to approach customers or the one-stop shop vendor or do you think both will be filled separately given potential different buying centers and companies? Does Mailchimp expedite your plans to potentially expand QuickBooks into more geographies on a quicker timeline? And I guess how do you expect this to evolve over time as we reached steady-state.? Thanks so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, thanks for the question. I'll take you back to the 3 priorities that we've declared because I think it goes after the great question that you've asked. First and foremost, our number one priority is really around creating one growth platform, and it's really a lot of the work behind the scenes in terms of building data pipelines and connecting the services so that the magical power of the data, both Mailchimp data and QuickBooks data can come together for the customer to put the power of the insights in their hands. So first and foremost, it's all about the product and creating one growth platform. The second is we see a huge opportunity to serve mid-market. As you know, we're already doing that from a financial management solutions perspective with QuickBooks Advance.  Now we're going to, in essence, build out the capabilities on Mailchimp and really disrupt the mid-market because this is a huge need for mid-market. And I would say third is actually having a global playbook and investing -- accelerating our investments in go-to-market, which I think will get at the last question that you asked that I didn't answer yet, and that is we want customers to have choice. So, if customers first want to engage with Mailchimp to be able to take their business online, to market their business and use CRM tools, they can use Mailchimp and -- but we'll make sure everything is payment-enabled. And then over time, if they want to use all of the invoicing capabilities, payroll capabilities, access to capital, ensure that they're compliant, all of that will be enabled within Mailchimp.  The vice versa is true. If you're using QuickBooks and you want to start using capabilities to market your business and manage your customers, all the capabilities of Mailchimp will be available to you, and Mailchimp could end up being, for instance, a nab item on the left-hand side. So, we will let customers make choice is, I think, the headline answer to your question. We will go to market separately. We will go to market together. We will raise awareness and ensure that customers know that there is one place where they can run their business, and more importantly, the power of all their data will be in one place to fuel their success. That's the approach that we're taking. Chirag Ved : All right, thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Greg Jackson : Great, thanks. Hey, it's Greg Jackson on for Sterling tonight. Thanks for taking our questions. The first one is actually on the better-than-expected performance for the remainder of the year from Credit Karma. And we're curious, is this -- I mean, is it driven more by a stronger bounce-back from an impact in 2020 in your traditional verticals, or is it more about having increased confidence, Michelle? And I think what you mentioned on the home and auto loans side. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you for the question. A couple of things I would start with. Last year, when you look at the full year of Credit Karma compared to the prior year, we grew 37%. And our new guidance for Credit Karma going forward is a range of 35% to 37%. And so, I think what you see within that is there has been a macro bounce back. But really a lot of what we're really seeing is the innovation on the platform, the power of Lightbox, the fact that members are getting better matches to things that they are looking for. Financial institutions are \u2013 and insurance companies are seeing the power of the platform.  And it's really just creating that network effect. So, I think what we're gaining confidence in is just the innovation, the technology investments in Lightbox, and in context of the macro environment as we look ahead that gives us confidence around the performance of Credit Karma. And again, I would just remind us that this is more of a longer-term comment. Credit Karma is a platform, and we're creating an ecosystem effect here. Credit Karma is part of the TurboTax experience, and we're excited for all of you to see what we're going to be launching in the coming tax season. TurboTax is part of the Credit Karma experience. Credit Karma is part of the payroll experience. So really think about Intuit as 1 platform with many platforms that solves different problems, and that's really what fuels our confidence as we look ahead. Greg Jackson : Okay, great. And then a follow-up, actually, on the tax business. And by the end of the second quarter, we'll be into the tax season. So, this is -- we're coming up on marketing time on TurboTax advertisement spent. So, any color that you can give us on what plans are for the marketing budget as we ramp up into January? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Well, I'm not going to talk about the marketing budget, but what I will share with you is it's very consistent and durable in context of what you've seen in the last couple of years. We are very focused on really fundamentally changing how you get your taxes done if you need assistance. And you're going to continue to see us be assertive in terms of how we raise awareness with 88 million customers that need assistance and how there's a better way to get your assistance. And also, the under-penetrated segments that we've talked about, which is Latinx, the investment community, and the self-employed. I think you can -- what you should expect is our investments on a platform has continued in those areas. We're really excited about the season coming up, and our marketing efforts will be really focused in those areas to continue to raise awareness. Greg Jackson : All right, great. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : You're very welcome Operator : Thank You. Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Congratulations. Great quarter. Sasan, I want to ask you about the new business, I mean, new customer acquisition trend that you are seeing. I remember you talked about lagging effect to new business creation in the U.S. So, wondering what's trend you're seeing on the QuickBooks new customer acquisition site, and what promotion or anything you are doing at this point? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you for your kind comments and the question. I would say that it's very consistent with what we talked to you all about at Investor Day, and that is that we're continuing to see the acquisition trends that we would expect in the U.S. across-the-board, both in the low-end of the market but also the trends that we're seeing in the mid-market, so those trends continue. And as we've shared before, we're not overly reliant by any means on new business formations. From just a health perspective, I would say the U.S. is consistent with what we talked about with all of you a few months ago.  And I would say outside of the U.S., again, very consistent with what before, the recovery has not been like the U.S. Now, if I were to double-click on that, I would say behind the U.S. has been Canada. And I think we're going to start seeing UK and Australia start to come back. Sorry, UK and France. And then Australia is, I would say behind UK and France. We do believe that in the next year or less, that international will start to slowly bounce back.  And the reason for just the slowness in international bouncing back is there's just been so many starts and stops those small businesses that just lost confidence. Do I build up inventory? Do I go hire more employees? Do I increase my own marketing budget? That they've just been slower in bouncing back. But we believe, within the next year or so, we'll see that strength. But the headline news is U.S. continues to be strong and match what we've expected, and international role will bounce back within a year. Siti Panigrahi : That's great. And a follow-up to TurboTax question, this is probably the first year you are going to tap into the Credit Karma members who are not using TurboTax. Do you see as -- what strategy do you have at this point to tap into such a massive member base in Credit Karma? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. We are really excited about just the possibilities of what we can do for members -- Credit Karma members and TurboTax customers. Last year really was a learning year and I think we're going to learn a lot more this year. Listen, our goal is we want every TurboTax customer to be using Credit Karma and all the benefits of Credit Karma, and we want every Credit Karma member to be using TurboTax, whether they want to do it themselves or they need assistance. I think we're going to be one year better than we were last year in terms of all of our experiences, in terms of just the investments that we've made and the experiences, and we're excited about it. But just to put it in context, at Investor Day, we shared with you our Horizon framework. Horizon 1 being sort of revenue impact within 0 months to 18 months, Horizon 2 being 18 months to 36 months, and Horizon 3 being 36 months plus. We actually put the impact of Credit Karma integrated as part of TurboTax and vice versa is almost 3 years out because we really want to nail the experience. But nevertheless, we're leaning in and we're excited about the things we're going to be launching in the weeks to come. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : You are very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Michael Turrin : Hey there. Thank you, and congrats on the amazing results to start off the fiscal year. We've talked about it. I mean, you've gotten a few questions on tax. We see this on the live technology, we see you're now offering expert setup for QuickBooks as well. So, wondering if you can just add any color on how far that expert led vision extends. Is that something you could take to consumer finance or potentially even something like email marketing with Mailchimp? It seems like a powerful addition to the product portfolio, and clearly a big bet you've been focused on. So, I'd love to hear more. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Michael. Thank you for your kind words, and great question. When we declared our bet around connecting people to experts and creating our virtual expert platform, we have been, I think we're onto now, I don't know 5 plus years, really investing in this virtual expert platform. There are so many underlying technologies, services where AI is being used to ensure that the platform matches the right customer to the right experts, to make the platform simple and easy-to-use for experts and we feel really confident relative to just the where we are with the virtual expert platform, and our focus, intentionally, has been really about serving customers when it comes to tax time and helping small businesses with the bookkeeping and eventually also with their taxes. But more importantly, just helping them run their business.  And we have so much opportunity ahead of us just in that space. With that said, we do have a few, what we call small mission-based genes that are exploring other spaces because we can leverage a lot of the capabilities of this virtual expert platform to serve spaces like marketing, potentially spaces like financial services. So, we are doing experiments but very intentionally to ensure that we can learn. I think I will just end with the opportunities of where we can take this virtual expert platform is endless. However, the biggest growth opportunity ahead of us right now is helping customers with taxes and helping small businesses run their business. And then as these other -- our verticals become reality, we'll, of course, share our plans with all of you. But it is something that will extend over time horizontally, continue verticals. Michael Turrin : That's a great answer. Michelle, you've historically not updated guidance before tax season. We've talked about some of the pockets of strength of Credit Karma. But in terms of breaking that historical pattern, are we just seeing a more diversified Intuit come through, or any comments you can provide just around the change there? Thank you. Michelle Clatterbuck : Yes. Thanks, Michael. Yes. This is something that diverges from what we have done historically. Historically, also, the Consumer Group has been such a large percentage of our business also. And now if we're adding -- Other parts of the business are growing more. We're adding Credit Karma. And overall, the composition of the business is just changing. Ans also, this is the one of the first times we've seen a real pandemic hit like this. And so, the growth after the pandemic has also had some implications for recovery and so forth. So yes, it is a little bit different, composition of the Company is a little different, but we feel really good about what we're seeing, and are very excited about the accelerated growth we're seeing in Credit Karma and in small business, and ready to jump into tax season. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congrats, guys. My question. You had a price increase go into effect during the quarter in small business. Any discernible impact to retention across your various skews, particularly from those who haven't attached payments or payroll? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Brad. Thank you for your kind words and the question. I would -- I'll say 2 things. 1. Really the majority of our growth continues to come from customer growth and mix in a much lesser extent price so you should just be aware of that, and 2. There's nothing that we've seen from the price increase that's outside of the balance of what we expected. So, the short answer is no. It's within our control limit as we expected it based on the testing that we had done. Brad Zelnick : Got it. And if I could just follow-up with one more, Sasan. There's no doubt a significant opportunity with Credit Karma money, and I believe you called out the opportunity for QuickBooks Payroll customers to deposit up to $232 billion of payroll funds into a CK money account. What traction have you seen on this so far, or what percentage of QuickBooks Payroll payees do you think you can ultimately capture with something like this? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, you know the -- well, first of all, we've not divulged our traction other than I would tell you. We generally are excited. As part of many things that we are providing in our portfolio to customers, giving them early access to wages, I think a lot of what we are learning and a lot of what we're excited about as we move forward. It depends on the customer and the cohort of customers. There are certain customers that depending on their situation and how much they depend on living weekly -- connected to their weekly paycheck.  If you live paycheck to paycheck, you are much more focused on can I get early access to that versus if you don't live week-to-week. So, we're learning about those cohorts within our payroll to your question and where we can get traction and where it's just not a need for customers. I would say more broadly, we are excited about early access to wages both providing it across payroll standalone, providing it through Credit Karma. And frankly I think over time this is just something that's going to be commodity. I think everybody is going to have a product feature that gives you early access to the wages. For us it's not just about the feature, it's about the ecosystem effect that it creates for our customers and our members. Brad Zelnick : Awesome. Thank you, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your question, please. Brent Thill : Sasan, you were clear when the Mailchimp deal closed that this is not just a mail Company, that there was a broader platform play for marketing and selling up a website. I'm just curious along that theme. What you're seeing in terms of the most excitement where you can bring Mailchimp into your clients and ultimately this platform plays for the front office and how that evolves. If you could cover that, that'd be great. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, absolutely, Brent. One of the things that we -- one of our mechanisms that we have as a Company is called our Big Bet review, where we take our officers of the Company through the experiences of each of the Big Bets to what we've learned, where we are, and where we're headed. And this is the last Big Bet review happened to be one where we brought in Ben as a team from Mailchimp, and actually walked through the experience in detail, where we are, and where we're going. And I would just tell you that we continue to even get more excited as we've closed the deal because the needs of our customers are in all the areas that you mentioned. They are -- and every customer it's in a different place, but customers are really looking for ways to be able to engage, getting new customers.  It's their bread and butter. Almost 70% of our customers are looking for ways to get new customers. We now have those capabilities and we'll integrate it into QuickBooks and vice versa, QuickBooks into Mailchimp. They want to be able to manage their existing customers in an automated way, in an insightful way where everything is automated. They don't have to know when do I follow up with a customer, what additional products can I sell them. All of that can get automated through Mailchimp. And one of the things people don't realize is one of the largest ways that you still engage customers, we see it through what we do in TurboTax, is actually email. So now we have all those capabilities.  We have abilities to put you on mega platforms with all of our digital assets, manage all of your existing relationships, all the email capabilities, but more importantly, it's the leveraging the power of the data, the customer data, and the purchase data to help you understand who is the customer, who bought what, what did they not buy, who's leading your shopping card, and how do you pursue them. It's consistent with what we've talked about before. That's the opportunity ahead, and that's about the work that we do now on the product to put the power of those capabilities in the hands of our customers. We couldn't be more excited to help our customers with their success. So, stay tuned. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good afternoon or good evening, Sasan. I wanted to ask you a little bit about TurboTax Live, maybe what the trends have been in terms of customers that are already TurboTax customers shifting to that product and new customers, and how you anticipate that trend evolving this tax season. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, it's a great question. It's one thing that's just really excites us about the Live platform. 1. There's 88 million folks that use an assisted method today. Within the assisted method, you have 10 million folks every year where there's churn, they go -- jump from one assisted method to another. So, from 1 accountant to another or from 1 store to an accountant. And then within the TurboTax base, the do-it yourself or as we have 4 million people that leave, and they ultimately go to an assisted method. I think that the answer to your question is it's all the above. We've seen conversion improvements, retention improvements.  We've seen TurboTax customers that did it themselves a year before where they had a life change, or they just weren't sure if they did their home deductions the right way or if they had a kid and the kid went to college, how that ultimately account for those deductions where they are now using the live platform and vice versa. You may use the life platform and I've enough confidence with the year after, you do it yourself and then you may then after that bounce back and now we're seeing 3, 4 years of trends. Really, it's all of the above with the largest, I would say, driver being folks that use a different assisted method coming onto a platform and, of course, those that have life changes within TurboTax, growing with TurboTax, and using the live platform. And we just see that continuing as we view this opportunity with a 10-year lens. Kartik Mehta : And just a question on Credit Karma. Sasan, you've talked about Credit Karma money and that sounds like a very interesting opportunity. I'm wondering, is there any concern that your customer says, hey, you're competing with me now for deposits and that causes issues? Sasan Goodarzi : One of the sorts of essential strategic principles that we have within Credit Karma is that it is an agnostic platform. And our financial institutions and all our partners see the power of that, how diligent and intentional we are about not creating our own products, but ensuring that we match members with a product that's right for them. And a lot of the capabilities that we have within Credit Karma ultimately had an institution that's participating in it. So that is not a concern that we have. Our say due is very, very high with financial institutions and we just believe that that's the beginning of it, especially with attraction of Lightbox which actually delivers more success for members and more success for financial institutions. So, it is not a concern of ours. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. Fantastic quarter, Sasan and Michael. Sasan, I'm curious to get your take on the issues that are facing -- that are being faced by the U.S. economy. You've got unprecedented labor shortage, got a supply chain issue, got an inflation issue. A lot of these problems do pertain to the small business ecosystem. When you think of Intuit and the dramatic transformation you've undertaken very successfully, but betting on AI, what can Intuit do to solve these problems for small business customers as it plays to these near-term headwinds that we're facing from your product perspective? Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Kash, thank you, 1, for your kind comment and it's a wonderful question on all those areas, the labor shortage, some of the supply chain challenges if you're a product-based business, and certainly inflation is absolutely impacting small businesses. I would make a broad comment that I would say we are experiencing. When you couple what happened with the pandemic starting in March of 2020, where it really, I think, forced everyone around the globe, whether you're a small business or not, but let's stay focused on small businesses to reinvent yourself. And it really accelerated the shift to virtual solutions.  It accelerated the shift to going online whether it's how you invoice get paid, how you do your payroll, how you do your time tracking. And I think that movement which is just simply continuing, I don't think wherever going to go back to the old way. I think this pandemic really has accelerated the shift in those areas that I mentioned, in particular to, of course, to digital money offering. I think that coupled with this not only labor shortage but also labor movements from job to job, some of the supply chain challenges that generally we believe as I talked to my peers will get -- start to get addressed by the second half of 2022, first half of 2023, an inflation is actually causing small businesses to leverage more platforms.  And so, if I then bring that back to our platform and the fact that if you use our platform, you can get paid upfront, you can get instant deposit, you can do same-day payroll, you can use an expert to ensure that you've got the best deductions as a small business and to ensure that you're running your business effectively, and the fact that you can do more with less people if you use one platform. That's where the power of Mailchimp comes into play, rather than having multiple tools where you're bouncing back and forth between tools and you're not really sure what your customer profitability is, when you should follow up with the customer, how to acquire more customers. All of those things are thrust to the use of our platform, and our platform is actually built to help you grow your business with less focus on labor and to be able to embrace as much as possible the inflation. Now, ultimately, we have to address overtime, and I believe it will get address some of these supply chain issues and inflationary issues. But that's where our platform comes into play and why we are so well-positioned for small businesses, and the role we need to play to continue to educate them. Kash Rangan : Excellent. Thank you so much. Quick 1 for Michelle. How do you assist of the long-term margin drivers, and generally, discreet things that margin growth is somewhat linear, but generally these things tend to go up in an S-curve, so we often underestimate the true profitably of companies in the long term? In your case, what are the things that we should be looking for that could drive increased operating leverage in the future? Thank you so much and congrats. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thank you, Kash. Appreciate that. Well, in the current year, as I spoke about earlier, we will see a margin adjustment with the acquisition of Mailchimp and so we do though believe that over time, we will continue to expand our margins as we've talked about from this new step-down level going forward. But as we become more and more of a platform, we see opportunities for us just across the Company, whether it is in technology and being able to increase the velocity of development on our platform and driving more services, using things like money movement across the Company, and our fraud and risk capabilities not having to duplicate those across the Company. Or in customer success is another great example, where we're scaling a common customer success platform so that we can more efficiently and effectively serve customers. And then also in the go-to-market area, really leveraging a common infrastructure to be able to more effectively target customers, manage our sales and marketing processes also. So, we do see a number of opportunities all across the P&L that as we look forward, there will be opportunities for us to leverage this. Kash Rangan : Wonderful. Brilliant. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills, Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Great. Thanks, guys. I'll likely to congratulations on a real nice quarter. I wanted to ask a question about TurboTax if I might, please. With this being the second year of your targeting the full-service opportunity, what were the learnings from the last year, your first year with this offering? Historically, you've seen this 1% to 2% share gain within Do-It-Yourself. Do-It-Yourself has gained 2 to 4 points as a category. Could this potentially accelerate those trends as you gain more intelligence to become more successful with this effort? And just generally, what are your expectations for this year with that offering? Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Brad. I would say 2 big things. One is a full service absolutely has a halo impact on confidence for the customer which actually gets me to the second point, and really the approach which is, we're a platform for our customers and so really if you think customer [Indiscernible], we want our customers to know that they have the ability to do it themselves. They can access an expert, if they need the expert to answer any questions that they have, and/or they can just have you -- us do their taxes for them and do everything digitally. By the way, midstream if you choose an expert and utilize, you know what? I don't know if I just want to help, I just want to Intuit to do it all for me, we'll do it all for you. So really our approach and now that we've had several years of experimenting and learning with full service is that now we have a true end-to-end platform where we can meet the needs of any customer, and the power has actually grown with customers over time. If they just start out their career or if they're students who they have life change, we have a platform that will meet all of their needs. So that's really the, I would say the headlines of the answers plays a halo effect, which has informed our platform approach as we look ahead. Brad Sills : Great to hear, Sasan. One more if I may, please, just on Credit Karma. Last year, you saw nice upside and the tax quarters are converting TurboTax filers to Credit Karma. Could you remind us where you are there? With that some low-hanging fruit initially, what drove that success that you saw in that business, and what is your outlook for that this year and going forward? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. I would really put last year entirely in the bucket of just learning. And it doesn't mean that's going to change this year. We are a Company that's all about moving fast, experimenting, pivoting, and learning all in context of being stubborn around the vision that we have. Last year was a learning year, although there were some nice member growth impacts to Credit Karma from TurboTax. We're really excited and eager to see how our new innovations and experiences on the platform plays out this year and to see what we learned.  I'll take you back to the reason at Investor Day we put the opportunity of Credit Karma is part of TurboTax experience, and TurboTax is part of the Credit Karma platform as a Horizon 3, is we're really focused on the customer and member experience in nailing that because we know over time we can monetize. So, we're excited about the year ahead. Look, we have 11 months under our belt, learning and adjusting and preparing for this tax season. And we're excited about these experiences being launched and seeing how they play out in the next couple of months. Brad Sills : Great to hear. Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. First question. In international, Sasan, 39% growth in small business is very nice. Could you just give a little summary of what you saw and where in the quarter, and then part B to the question is you mentioned Mailchimp will --should accelerate global growth. I'm just curious when and how we'll see it showing up in the category. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Sure, Scott. Thank you. First up on international, we saw some of the same trend given our, not only our execution but the macro environment as we've seen the last couple of quarters. There are certain countries like Canada that have bounced back a bit more strongly. Then there's places like Australia that really have been very slow to bounce back based on the fact that the economy keeps opening and shutting down. And again, our view is within the next year, international should start to come back from a macro perspective.  So, net-net, our trends in our performance, although we're very pleased with that, we believe over time to paint the different picture as the macro environment comes back. In terms of Mailchimp, our focus is the 3 priorities that I mentioned. We want to create an amazing product and platform that brings QuickBooks and Mailchimp together. We want to build the capabilities to go disrupt mid-market.  And then, as Michelle mentioned, we're going to be investing heavily in our global go-to-market. I would say I wouldn't overly anticipate a significant change in our trajectory international because of Mailchimp where there's some fundamental things, we want to get right to ensure that we can truly be the platform that -- where you can grow your business and run your business and over time it will certainly have an impact internationally and we're excited about that because it gives us another foot in the door outside of the U.S. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks. And just for our last one. Congratulations on the Intuit Dome. I'm just curious -- and maybe beat now crypto.com on that one. But just curious on the overriding big somatic marketing push of the Company in the last few years. How should we think about that on the big scale? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : I would say, and I've said this for years, and I think you're used to hear Brad talk about this. I think where the world's biggest hidden secret, and we don't want that secret to hold true anymore. We want to make sure the world knows who Intuit is and what our brands are. And we have data that shows that the more customers learn that TurboTax, Credit Karma, Mailchimp now, and QuickBooks when they learn that they're part of the Intuit brand and the platforms are all connected, it actually has a positive impact on our potential for growth. So, the way we think about Intuit Dome, it is not, for us, a naming rights deal.  We've had many opportunities where we've actually been pursued to be part of deals like this and we pass them up over the years. We did this because one, it's very technology forward dome. We're going to be helping the community. And 2. We're really going to be able to showcase our brands. And it will be yet another way to demonstrate the benefits that we bring to the market as one Intuit platform and the impact that we can have in the lives of consumers and small businesses. That's really how we think about it and why we're excited about it. And by the way, over time, we expected the same return on investment as we do with our marketing investments and that's really what this is. It just goes beyond marketing to impacting the local communities in LA, which we're excited about. Scott Schneeberger : Excellent. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure. Thank you. Well, first of all, I really appreciate all the questions. And once again, I want to just thank our employees for their incredible hard work, our customers and our partners for the strong start to the year, and the opportunity we have ahead of us. We're very passionate about fundamentally powering the prosperity of our customers and communities, and we're proud of our accomplishments, and we continue to believe that we are just getting started. Thanks for your question, Thanks for your time, and we will see you at our next earnings call. Bye, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Latif, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions].  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Kim Watkins : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Unfortunately, Michelle has lost her voice, so I will be reading her prepared remarks today. Sasan and I will take your questions during Q&A. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2021 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these prepared remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Second quarter results reflect continued strong momentum across the company as we execute on our strategy to be a global AI-driven expert platform, powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses. We have a nearly $300 billion addressable market, driven by tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions and acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities and digital money offerings. This, combined with the team's excellence in execution, is contributing to the strength of our performance. Second quarter revenue of $2.7 billion was driven by strong results from our Small Business and Self-Employed Group, Credit Karma and reflects an earlier start to the tax season compared to last year in the Consumer Group. Since tax season is now underway, let me start there. We are confident in our strategy of extending our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transforming the assisted segment. Based on our analysis, we are on track to gain share overall again this season. This, and other early indicators, gives us reason to be excited about our innovation and go-to-market decisions. Our focus this season is threefold. First, we continue to aggressively transform the assisted category by reshaping how 88 million filers get their maximum refund with confidence virtually. This opens up the $20 billion assisted tax prep category for Intuit. Second, we're serving the underpenetrated segments of LatinX, Self-Employed and investor segments, which are growing faster than the overall tax filing. And third, we're serving millions of members on the Credit Karma platform with personalized experiences. Our team has developed a strong game plan to win this season, and we are on track to achieve our full year Consumer Group guidance of 10% to 11% revenue growth. Our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are : revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we're transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing the 88 million filers who have previously relied on an in-person assistant the opportunity to access expert help or have an expert to file their taxes for them. We have improved the experience for customers by applying artificial intelligence to match them with an expert who is right for their specific situation and to deliver insights to experts so they can provide excellent service. These capabilities are also now available in the Credit Karma app for members that use an assisted method to file their taxes last year. We are off to a strong start in our busy season with QuickBooks Live. We're now giving customers earlier visibility as to how their business is performing, getting their books cleaned up faster and connecting them with an expert easier. We've seen some of our strongest weeks of new customer acquisition in January and retention rates in our target customer segment increased several points versus a year ago. We believe QuickBooks Live will enable us to reach small and mid-market businesses that have not used financial management software. And we are eager to continue accelerating our momentum for this offering. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. Credit Karma is a data platform with powerful network effects solving a 2-sided problem. Our vision is to unlock smart money decisions by creating an autonomous financial platform that helps consumers find the right financial products, puts more money in their pockets and connects them to insights and advice. In Credit Karma, we are innovating across all verticals. Our proprietary Lightbox technology allows us to better personalize and connect members to the products that are right for them, providing more certainty. Credit Karma's data platform and engagement model creates powerful network effects. We continue to see strength in credit cards and personal loans. Lightbox approximately doubles the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma, making it a competitive differentiator for both our members and partners. We are solving a larger set of financial challenges for consumers in the auto and home verticals. And in auto insurance, we'll continue to strengthen the Karma Drive program. We launched new features and experiences this tax season designed to help the majority of Credit Karma members filed easily with TurboTax and gain deeper insights into their finances. We're also offering tax filers early access to their refunds through direct deposit and refund advance program. First, Credit Karma launched a capability for members who previously filed with TurboTax to provide them with insights about their finances and taxes. Second, most Credit Karma members are able to file with TurboTax within the Credit Karma app and are eligible for special offers. And third, tax filers who choose to deposit their refund into a Credit Karma Money account will receive the refund up to 5 days early with direct deposit or get a portion of their refund in as little as 1 hour after the return is accepted through the TurboTax Refund Advance program. These TurboTax customers drive Credit Karma member growth and get access to personalized products across the platform, which accelerates engagement over time. Big picture, we continue to grow members by delivering personalized financial products, helping members save money, pay down debt and get faster access to their money while providing insights and advice. Over time, we are creating a virtuous cycle, which we expect to increase the frequency of engagement, transactions and monetization across our ecosystem. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we continue to innovate to help customers overcome this challenge. In payments, we continue to improve discoverability, increased usage of features like Instant Deposit and roll out new innovations like Get Paid Upfront to help qualified customers get paid soon after the invoice is set. All of this innovation is driving strength in our charge volume. And in payroll, we continue to focus on making it easier for small businesses to pay their employees and provide them with expanded benefits. Nearly 40% of Americans say that they would struggle to pay an unexpected $400 emergency expense. We recently announced QuickBooks Early Pay, which will allow eligible employees pay through QuickBooks Online payroll to access money between paydays. Getting and engaging customers remains a significant pain point for small and mid-market businesses. With Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First is to deliver on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. Since the acquisition closed in November, we've been moving with speed to deliver for our customers. We're aggressively building a seamless integration between QuickBooks and Mailchimp to create a growth platform, investing in marketing and introducing the Intuit leadership playbook and operating system to execute at scale. Together, we are uniquely positioned to enable small and mid-market businesses combine their customer data from Mailchimp and purchase data from QuickBooks to deliver actionable insights they need to grow and run their businesses with confidence. And this is where the real magic happens. Now shifting to the long term. We're also looking far ahead to anticipate our customers' future needs through our 6-year planning process, a part of Intuit's operating system, which we use to run the company. In December, our top leaders studied our customer problems and industry trends, the progress we've made since declaring our Big Bets 3 years ago and where we can have the largest impact in the future. This led to refreshing our 5 Big Bets to accelerate innovation, powering the prosperity of those that we serve. While our strategy remains durable and the essence of our big bets are the same, we have expanded the customer problems we want to solve and our vision for each Big Bet. For instance, as part of first Big Bet, revolutionize speed to benefit, we are accelerating investments in decentralized technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency, enabling us to help customers put more money in their pockets faster. As part of our second Big Bet, connecting people to experts, we're reframing how we think about virtual experiences by exploring metaverse technologies and expanding the segments we serve beyond tax and accounting to play a more meaningful role in our customers' lives. We'll unpack this evolution in more detail at our Investor Day in the fall. We remain focused on our role as a strong corporate citizen and the impact we are making on the communities where we live and work to further our mission. Intuit was recently recognized by JUST Capital on its JUST 100 top-performing companies list for 2022 for our progress on DEI, along with our focus on climate change, worker wellness, job creation and customer privacy. Wrapping up, our strong business fundamentals, including our balance sheet, our speed of innovation and demand for our platform, continue to put Intuit in a position of strength. Despite macro conditions such as rising inflation, supply chain issues, the Great Reshuffling and geopolitical conflicts, our platform continues to thrive as digitization is more important now than ever, supporting our customers' needs to put more money in their pockets and helping them run and grow their businesses. We are proud to be the platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper.  Now let me turn it over to Kim. Kim Watkins : Thanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2.7 billion, up 70%, including 31 points from the addition of Mailchimp and Credit Karma, GAAP operating income of $56 million versus an operating loss of $25 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $612 million versus $235 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.35 versus $0.07 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.55 versus $0.68 last year. After the quarter ended, we entered into an agreement that will resolve the majority of pending arbitration claims related to the Free File litigation without admitting any wrongdoing. This resulted in an immaterial charge reflected in our fiscal Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP results. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 47% during the quarter or 27% on an organic basis, excluding $240 million in revenue from Mailchimp. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 74% or 37% excluding Mailchimp. With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold : grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 35% in fiscal Q2, driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking grew 139% in fiscal Q2. Excluding Mailchimp, online services revenue grew 39%. Mailchimp revenue recorded in online services was $240 million in the quarter. This was in line with our expectations. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. Within payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally. Total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 226% in fiscal Q2 on a constant currency basis and 33% on an organic basis, excluding Mailchimp. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 6% in the second quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew low double digits, driven by strong customer growth and price increases. As a reminder, this fall, we transitioned to a subscription model for this year's desktop offering, which we expect to be a headwind to revenue growth in the second half of the year. Longer term, we expect the desktop business to decline. Consumer Group revenue of $411 million grew 180% in Q2, reflecting the earlier IRS opening this year. We are seeing a slower forming tax season taking into consideration both the earlier IRS open date this year and the latest IRS data. While still early in the season, our analysis shows we are on track to gain share overall, excluding users with the TurboTax free file offering in prior year periods. We remain confident in our plans and guidance of 10% to 11% revenue growth for fiscal 2022. We continue to focus on our strategy to extend our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. As a reminder, there are 4 key drivers of our Consumer Tax business. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. The third is our share and the fourth is average revenue per return.  Turning to the ProConnect Group. Revenue grew 14% in Q2, also reflecting the earlier IRS opening this year. Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue was $444 million in Q2, another record revenue quarter, driven by high levels of monthly active users and revenue per monthly active user. Within the quarter, we saw another record quarter driven by the combined strength in personal loans and credit cards. The growth verticals reflected momentum year-over-year in auto loans and home loans. And we are developing the emerging vertical by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Turning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As we shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on being an AI-driven expert platform. These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We returned excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $519 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, payable on April 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Now turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance, including 26% to 28% revenue growth or 18% to 20% growth excluding Mailchimp. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 includes revenue growth of 32% to 33%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.18 to $6.24 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.51 to $7.57. You can find our full Q3 and fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. As you are aware, we completed the acquisition of Mailchimp, the largest transaction in Intuit's history during the second quarter. We are working to finalize the purchase price accounting process, which could result in a onetime impact to our second quarter GAAP-only results and full year fiscal 2022 GAAP-only guidance we issued today. This process will not result in a change to the total consideration of the transaction. We expect to complete this process before we file our 10-Q. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Kim. During our busiest season of the year, we are seeing continued momentum across the company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform that is powering the prosperities for consumers and small businesses. I'm proud of what the team has accomplished this quarter, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to find new innovative ways to serve our more than 100 million customers. Now let's open it up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : I guess I'd like to start with -- Sasan, what do you view -- I know we don't have a lot of color from the IRS, but could you go in a little bit to -- we started the tax season earlier, but it's a little uncommon because it seems to be starting slow. Could you speak a little bit to what's behind that? And then a follow-up to something else on that topic. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Scott. I would tell you, it's nothing unusual. Every year, I've been with the company 17 years and ran the TurboTax business for 3 years and every day -- every year, there seems to be a shift of consumer behavior shifting later and later in the year -- in the tax year. And primarily, it's because they know that they can. And especially now, I would say, with the fact that you can get access to an expert through our services versus relying on an in-person assistance and/or you can do it yourself, it's just consumer behavior shifting. I wouldn't read anything into it. It's not unusual. It is a trend that's been happening for years and it's continued this year. Scott Schneeberger : Great. And obviously, that's what's behind the reinstatement of the guidance and the comfort in the full season. I guess just a double follow-up on this topic. I heard in Kim's remarks, Free File Alliance, it sounds like people who utilized TurboTax through Free File Alliance in the past may have stuck with you this year. If you could elaborate on that a little bit? And then also if you could touch upon last year, you saw a boon of premier customers from investments. Could you just speak to how that is trending this year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, yes. For sure. Well, first of all, let me start with what Kim stated, the point Kim was trying to make was twofold. One, the fact that it is early in the season, but we are really happy with the fact that we are, in fact, taking share and that share that we are taking, we're just being explicit excludes those that filed in the Free File program. We'll see throughout season if some of those folks come back to us, which would be great. But that was really her comment. What you should take away is the way we keep score, which is our total share increasing as a total part of IRS returns, we are increasing share, and we're happy with our progress. Two, in terms of your question around investors, I would just say that as we've talked about often, there are really -- if I were to simplify 2 big strategic focus areas for us. One is really to fundamentally, make it easier for those that need assistance to get their taxes done through TurboTax Live. And then two, we are focused on 3 underpenetrated segments, investors, LatinX and those that are self-employed. And we feel good about the way the season has started, the way it's trending and given that there are simply is more people that have personally done stock trades, whether it's a stock or it's cryptocurrencies, we feel we're very well positioned with not only the experience that we have improved and how easy we make it for you to bring in your trade, but also the fact that we have an expert that -- are experts in this specific area around trading in cryptocurrency. And we've also upped our game in terms of how we are raising market awareness. We're being very clear that for those that have done trades, whether it's with cryptocurrencies or otherwise, we've got our experts that know and understand your situation, and we're delivering great experiences for them for those that are coming in. So we're very excited about our progress, and we're excited about the rest of the season as it relates to all 3 of those segments and particularly the investor segment that you asked about. Operator : Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : I wanted to follow up on the Consumer Tax side. Based on what you know now, as you look at your targets for the year, has anything changed in terms of your assumptions on how you would achieve them in terms of how much of the growth would come from unit volume versus increased revenue per return? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Sterling, thank you for your question. The short answer is no. We -- things are playing out the way we had assumed, which is both a combination of really going after the assisted segment, along with the 3 underpenetrated segments that I just mentioned and thus far, it's playing out as we'd assumed. So no change in our assumptions based on everything that we are seeing with our KPIs. Sterling Auty : All right. Great. And then one quick follow-up on Credit Karma. I get this a lot from investors. Any sense that you can give investors as to what a rising interest rate environment might do to the business profile or business trends for Credit Karma, either positive or negative? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. We don't really see an impact with rising interest rates, and I'll put it in 2 dimensions. One is consumers are always looking to access financial products, whether it's credit cards, personal loans, mortgage, auto loans, insurance, et cetera. So the demand continues, whether the interest rates are high or low because they're looking to access financial products. And two, financial institutions continue to invest even in a high interest rate market, especially in our platform because, in essence, their conversion is much higher on our platform because of Lightbox. And that's, by the way, why the demand will continue to be higher on our platform given that we have the Lightbox technology that really delivers a personalized financial product that's right for you at the lowest rate. So that's really one element. And I think the other element I would just remind us of is we are extremely low shared when you -- if I just use personal loans and credit cards as an example, what we shared at Investor Day, we have less than 5% share. So the more we continue to make a perfect match delivering personalized experiences for consumers, the more they're going to come on our platform, which is what we're seeing. And then the more financial institutions will invest in ensuring that their credit models on our Lightbox because they ultimately increase their conversion and their return on investment. So again, that was a long answer to your short question, I wanted to unpack it, but we don't see an impact of the demand is going to be there. And right now, financial institutions are really continuing to see a better trajectory than they did even a year or 2 years ago being on our platform. Operator : Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Sasan, I am always petrified of paying taxes. So I will avoid taxes. I'll ask you about the QuickBooks Online Ecosystem. I've been watching the company embark on this journey of being able to get better attach rate for its payments and payroll products. It's been a very nice journey that's come along. And you -- at the point where you're breaking out online services as a separate business, which is fantastic. Can you talk to us a little bit about what are your aspirations for payment and payroll attached for your Small Business installed base? Where do you see that going? Especially with QuickBooks Advanced, do you see yourself being able to attack a different lens of the market opportunity, throwing Mailchimp, everything gets a little bit more interesting. But just curious to see how much more upside is there in that business? Because that seems like it's a very small business, but it could be potentially large given the size and volume of payments that are going through your backbone. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Kash. Great question. First of all, petrified or not, you're going to have to get your taxes done by April 15. That's a wonderful... Kash Rangan : No question. Sasan Goodarzi : Wonderful reason for us being in the tax business, slow-forming or not, taxes will get done by April 18. With that said, to answer your question, I'll start at the highest level and do maybe a couple of double clicks. One, one of the many reasons why we are so excited about the Small Business opportunities, it is a very, very large TAM. And our penetration in that total customer TAM is still well below 10% when you look at the number of customers we have and the addressable market in the countries that we are in. So one, penetration is low, which is a big fuel for current growth and our continued growth. The second is even within the customers that we have, our penetration of the services that they use, which are primarily manual, is even lower. So if you start at the top with low penetration, both customer TAM and then services TAM because it's primarily manual, it's not yet digital, if one paints the factual picture of how large the opportunity is. I think then secondly, you asked the question about our aspiration, and I mean this very intentionally. Our aspiration is that we want every customer on our platform to be able to use the services that we have, and we want 100% of the customers to use 100% of the services as long as it is relevant to them, which is why our quest has continued to make it drop-dead easy for customers to use our services. Which I think gets to the third point, and we are such a different company than even a year ago than 2 years ago, we truly have a very powerful network and ecosystem of services from managing your money in and money out, and helping you get organized on accounting to helping you with payments, both receiving and sending payments to not only payrolls but ultimately benefits that we offer employees to then lending capabilities. And then ultimately, all the capabilities that we are -- we now have and are integrating to be able to help you grow your business to put your business online, market your business and all the CRM capabilities. So we truly now have a suite of services to fuel the success of small businesses. And the reason we're seeing the services growth is because small businesses are seeing that by being on our platform and digitizing everything, it actually not only helps them grow, that helps them manage their cash and put more money in their pocket, but it helps them understand the profitability of their customers. And then the last thing I would say is actually what you just raised, which is very well positioned versus even where we were a couple of years ago in that we are not going upmarket to serve mid-market with QuickBooks Advanced. With that comes a 4x higher ARPC because they use more of the services that we have. And with QuickBooks Live, although very, very early days, because you're in essence engaging with advice and an expert, we are seeing hiring engagement in services than if you don't use those services. So when you take all of that into account, I think the headline is large TAM, low penetration. We've got the services that we need on our platform, and it's really about just delivering for our customers, and we have years of growth ahead of us. Thanks, Kash. And do your taxes by April 15. Kash Rangan : No choice. Operator : Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Sitikantha Panigrahi : Just wanted to ask about your comment about new customer acquisition trend. You talked about earlier the lagging effect from new business creation. So as you looked at new business creation trend, how should we think about new customer acquisition as a growth driver for a QuickBooks? And also, as you're seeing the new cohort coming in, what kind of mix safety you're seeing for the higher ASP, like QuickBooks Advanced or other higher ASP products? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Siti, thank you for your question. First of all, I'll start by reminding all of us that the way we want you all to think about the model to make it simplistic is that we expect to grow new customers between 10% to 20%. And we expect to grow our ARPC between 10% to 20%, and that's ultimately how we will achieve -- achieving the online revenue growth, ecosystem revenue growth of 30% plus. So new customer acquisition is important to us, and we have many ways now to do it, both from serving the lower end of the market, which is, in essence, with QuickBooks Checking all the way to the top end of the market with QuickBooks Advanced, which serves the mid-market customers. The -- and as I mentioned just a moment ago, we have a very large TAM with low penetration. The new customer comment that I made was in context of QuickBooks Live. We are now, I think, in our third year in QuickBooks Slide. We've worked really hard to understand our customers' needs and get the product market fit. And just in the month of January, which is where the really, the busy season started, we saw some of our best weeks of customer acquisition. And which means, one, we're proud. Two, we're learning a ton, which positions us not only for the months to come, but for next year. And lastly, regarding new business formation, ultimately, the businesses that start using us are a bit more established. So we don't really rely on these business formations, although it's in the long term good for us because ultimately, all roads lead to QuickBooks platform especially now that we have capabilities to grow your business and run your business. But we don't get impacted significantly one way or the other with near-term new business formations. It's more established businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Congratulations on a really nice quarter. And maybe expanding a little bit on Siti's question there. Obviously, there's some pretty extraordinary events going on all around us right now, whether it's what's going on in Europe, whether it's the inflation numbers that we've been dealing with or in a Fed rate hiking cycle, which is difficult. It's a very volatile market environment. You guys have a great perspective on overall small business health. Can you give us an update kind of what you're seeing? Is any of this volatility starting to impact small businesses at all? And have you put any of that potential caution, if you will, because of this volatile environment into not raising your guidance because you guys had a really good Q2, particularly on the Small Business and Credit Karma side of the equation, but the full year guide doesn't really move? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Keith, thank you for your question. And let me parse it into 2 pieces. One, I'll just remind us that when you look at the total small business market that we serve, which is up to 100 employees, almost 70% of those businesses are service-based businesses and about 30% are product-based businesses. And frankly, what we've seen, which is why I was intentional about putting this in my opening remarks, with the combination of what happened in COVID where everybody got stuck at home, and what's happening with inflation and supply chain issues, which doesn't really overall impact our service base business as much, it's more of the product-based businesses. There's just a shift to digitization because ultimately, small businesses see that they can be much more effective, much more efficient in running their business on our platform, and in fact, expanding the services that they use to digitize everything. So we are actually seeing that this environment, although none of us want to these supply chain issues, none of us want to see geopolitical issues. It is actually -- from a health standpoint, there's acceleration to I want to use digital platform. So that's, first and foremost, what we're seeing. And just to remember that the majority of our revenue is in the U.S. And although our aspirations are to be much, much more global, and we have 30% of our QuickBooks space outside of the U.S. the macro issues that impact -- that we got impacted with relative to COVID are already baked into what we see internationally. And so the strength of what we're talking about is based on the fact that small businesses again, see this as an opportunity to digitize and we just think it's the beginning of it. It is a secular shift.  Let me actually answer your second question around guidance. We -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we are seeing strength in Small Business and in Credit Karma. And we actually are not seeing a tapering that we initially thought we would see in Credit Karma. So there's strength across every segment of the company. And that includes tax. It's just a slower-forming season. And with that said, as you know, we raised our guidance in the first quarter of the year, which is very, very unlike us. And we simply just want to get through tax season, and we'll relook at our guidance next quarter. But we are continuing to see strength in all the segments. Keith Weiss : Got it. And on the Credit Karma, I did notice the strength in credit card, also the strength in Credit Karma margins. I know Michelle doesn't have a voice right now, but I know you could take it. Anything that we should be thinking about in terms of the second half of the year, why those margins wouldn't be sustainable? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Keith, in general, I would not pay too much attention to the ups or downs in our margins by segment. We truly manage the company margins at the company level -- and we not just -- we don't manage it just for the sake of managing it at the company level. The number of investments that we make across the platform to fuel our innovation forces us to really think holistically to ensure that we don't short-change any segment at the company level. So if it's too high 1 quarter, I wouldn't get too excited. If it's low 1 quarter, I wouldn't wonder why it's low. We managed it at the company level. And as you know, we've been expanding margins and it's built into our guidance. And I feel good about our margin expansion. I just wouldn't pay too much attention to the segment level. Keith Weiss : Sasan, that's remarkable. It's exactly the same answer Michelle would have given. Sasan Goodarzi : Well, that's why we're partners in crime. Keith Weiss : Exactly. Excellent. Congratulations... Sasan Goodarzi : And she's smiling, you can't see it. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. And I'll echo the congrats on a great quarter. Sasan, I listened carefully to your response to the first question to say that perhaps TurboTax Live was one factor that helped to get filers more comfortable, that they can be more relaxed and maybe file a little bit later. Is there anything that you see specifically in terms of live adoption that gives you optimism for what it can be as a percentage of the mix for the full season? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Brad, thank you for your question. I'll tell you, I'm starting to lose count, but I think this is our fourth year with TurboTax Live and as you know, this year, we are -- TurboTax is truly a platform. You can bounce back and forth between the platform from doing it yourself to getting access to an expert to help you in any which way you want to ultimately doing your taxes for you. And really where we've upped our game this year, which is a true differentiator to get folks to switch is the expertise of the experts. Because ultimately, what customers care about is if I'm a plumber or if I'm an investor or if I'm self-employed, if I worked in 2, 3 states, I want to know that you understand my situation, which is why we've invested so much time not only in improving that matching by applying AI, but also making sure that the collaboration experience is seamless because a lot of this advice can also be done through AI. That was a long way to answer your question. We are bullish about TurboTax Live. We are bullish about the 10 million customers that have churned within the assisted category. What we talked about at Investor Day last year, which is 17 million people that started TurboTax but never finished. And we like what we see, and we'll report out on where it all ended in our earnings in May. But it's playing a big role in what we would expect, both going after assisted, but also going after the underpenetrated segments, which actually look to assistance more than otherwise. Brad Zelnick : That's very helpful, Sasan. And maybe just a follow-up, either for you or for Kim. I think in your prepared remarks, and I think it was a Small Business comment, you talked about retention in target customers increasing several points. I just want to make sure I have that right. And if you can clarify it and unpack that first, that would be great. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, yes, for sure, Brad. Let me parse it into 2 parts. One, what we talked about relative to last year was that our overall retention rates in Small Business were actually up full stop. What I -- the comment that I made in our opening remarks was that we're seeing a lot of goodness in QuickBooks Live, both in the start of the season, both in terms of new customer acquisitions where we've had record weeks and for the cohort of customers that we are focused on in certain segments, our retention is up in QuickBooks Live. And both of those are really, really important because we want to not only acquire the customers, but deliver the service that they need so they stay with us and come back, and that was -- that was the point I alluded to in the remarks. Operator : Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : I'll echo the congrats on a nice quarter. Sasan, can you just talk about some of the early learnings maybe from Mailchimp just in terms of go-to-market, what you've learned about sort of the cross-pollination of your clients? And also, how far out are we in terms of having a bit more harmonized back end between Mailchimp and QuickBooks. And what should we expect on that from a sort of technical integration perspective? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, yes. Sure, Kirk. So let me just quickly touch on these 3 priorities that we have that we're maniacally focused on.  One is to create this growth platform where really the magic is what we do behind the scenes with the data. It's combining the customer data, along with the purchase data to really help them understand where to target, where they can grow wallet share what the profitability of their customers are, et cetera. And that's extremely powerful for our customers, not only to grow the services within our overall platform, but also to acquire new customers because the reality is we will be the only platform that has this capability in one place.  The second is to position ourselves together to pursue mid-market because this is even a bigger need as you could imagine, in mid-market. And then third, half of their business is outside of the U.S. And frankly, other than having a wonderful drop-dead easy platform you haven't spent a lot of efforts internationally, and we are doubling down international.  To answer your question on several months in, we're more excited about the capabilities of what is possible than we were even before and are even more intentional about the work that we need to do to bring these 3 priorities to life. If I were to paint a sort of general picture, I would say we'll probably be in a place in about a year where we're really seeing the impact of the momentum of these priorities as it relates to our outcomes and our results because we've inserted in Mailchimp some of our best product people that really understand QuickBooks, really understand this space that are building out the platform with, of course, the Mailchimp engineers, which are all part of Intuit. And we think getting this right and we know how to get it right, we think about a year or so, we'll start seeing the impact of the priorities that we are focused on. The good news is we know how to do it, and there's no surprises there. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Michael Turrin : Nice job to Kim stepping in there. We've seen it and enjoyed the ad campaigns of late. Is there anything you can add around engagements or early returns you're seeing on some of those programs? And maybe Sasan if you could expand on your view around striking the right balance between maintaining the powerful brand of each individual property, I think they're all fairly well known and established as separate entities versus presenting Intuit as a more holistic platform, that would be great. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Great. Thank you for your question, Michael. I'll start with the latter one first. And I think it was really importantly stated it in your question. We have very powerful brands that our customers love and use, Mailchimp, TurboTax, Credit Karma and QuickBooks. And our intent is to really from a brand perspective, convey that they are connected and connected means that you get more benefit as a customer and the power of those benefits in really fueling your success as an individual or as a business. So all that means is the brands are powerful, the brands are not going to go away. It's about how we invest to make the connection in the minds of customers that this is all Intuit and by the way, here's why you should care. The second element around the campaigns, it's -- it's early, but we're actually -- and my comments specifically around TurboTax as I assume that's what you were asking about if it's broader, please come back and ask the other elements of your question. We're really pleased with our campaign so far this year. And our intent going in was to really communicate this year that we have experts that understand your situation. If you look at our campaigns, both on-air and digitally, you'll see things around communicating to those that are self-employed, communicating to those that have moved multiple states, communicating to those that have made investments in helping them understand no matter what your situation is, we have an expert that can help your situation. And we've invested heavily in not only who we bring on board, but also our AI capabilities, not only to make that perfect match but also to deliver insights to those experts to make them much more effective and productive so we can do things at scale. So the consideration, awareness and understanding of what we're trying to communicate, so far has been very well received. And then, of course, we'll know more as we go through season. That's about just our results, but we do a lot of mix -- marketing mix modeling work to understand what was effective, how can we improve our game going forward. And we did this across the company, but we'll better understand the impact with data. So far, the qualitatively and early data has been very positive. Michael Turrin : We saw the DJ Khaled commercials at the Super Bowl as well. Those were also great. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Ken Wong : Fantastic. I wanted to just touch on Credit Karma as a channel for TurboTax. Last year, very effective in terms of driving new customer adoption. I kind of saw last year was the trial year and this year is the first real push. Just would love a sense of what you're seeing from a consumer engagement perspective in the first few weeks of tax season. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Ken, great question. Let me just say it's twofold. One, we've gone in really big within TurboTax exposing TurboTax customers to Credit Karma where they can put their refund on a Credit Karma Money account, where they will get 5 days early access and really tax time, it's all about the money. And then these folks become new Credit Karma members and that we can expose them to the Credit Karma platform. We're really pleased with where that's going and the progress that we made. Of course, I won't share any stats with you, but we are -- I'll just leave it as we're very pleased. The second is last year, it almost wasn't even a trial year in Credit Karma. We sort of threw in TurboTax into the Credit Karma app. This year is really the first year where TurboTax, you can actually get your taxes done within the Credit Karma app. And for most cases, you don't actually have to go to TurboTax, which is a far, far better experience. We're getting wonderful learnings and adjusting real-time. We are, for the long term, really bullish about the -- not only all TurboTax customers using Credit Karma, but hopefully getting all Credit Karma members that already don't do their taxes with TurboTax, the BA TurboTax users. So, so far, we love what we're learning, the adjustments that we're making, and we continue to remain very bullish about just the whole prospect of why we're doing the integration between these 2 platforms and the impact that it's having for our members and TurboTax customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolf Research. Alex Zukin : Sasan, maybe just one multipart one for me. I'm looking at the SMB online ecosystem number, and it looks like ex Mailchimp, growth there was about 4% sequentially. And I want to understand if you could unpack what's driving that? Because I'm trying to understand was Q1 like unseasonably strong and Q2 is kind of back to normal? Or what's the right way to think about that, unpack maybe the drivers between payroll payments and capital and time tracking? And how do we think about that in the second half of the year growing sequentially because year-over-year, it's accelerating and it's fantastic. But just looking back at history, understanding that a little bit better, I think it would be helpful. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Alex. Very good question. So first of all, I'll start with the obvious, which is overall, Small Business grew 24%. This is all excluding Mailchimp. And our Online Ecosystem revenue growth grew 37%. And as you know, our goal is to grow over 30%. So we actually had a extremely strong quarters. So I'm not sure what the sequential number is that you were throwing out there, but we had a very, very strong quarter, well above our 30% mark. And it's based on strength in volume and the mix of customers that are coming in and particularly the services that they are using across payments, payroll, time tracking and QuickBooks Capital. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to see strength in Small Business and Credit Karma in the second half of the year. We don't expect a tapering. And as I mentioned earlier, we just really want to get through tax season and talk about our guidance after the quarter. So I wouldn't read anything into the fact that Small Business is going to taper. I would say, focused on our compass, which is we want to grow north of 30% with our Online Ecosystem revenue and we actually are seeing great strength. Alex Zukin : And then, Sasan, you mentioned Credit Karma a couple of times. You've gotten asked the question and kind of how you're seeing even more strength than you anticipated to some extent, no tapering, if you will. How is the progression of synergies going with Credit Karma within the Online Ecosystem business specifically? What are you seeing there? What learnings? And if you look at areas where you feel like there's an ability to double down and see even more growth, where would those be? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Alex, the -- strategically, the biggest area that we've been focused on has been really integrating Credit Karma into the TurboTax experience and then vice versa. So what that means is if you're a TurboTax customer at the end, one of the first options that you get is to put your refund on a Credit Karma Money account. And as I mentioned a moment ago, that was a strategic thesis that we had, and it's going really well. And these become new Credit Karma members and then we can expose other benefits on the Credit Karma platform to those customers. The second is building out within the Credit Karma app the TurboTax experience and contextually engaging customers with helping them get their taxes done. And to say we're in the early days is interesting, right, because we're only a year in. We like the progress that we're seeing, and that's the area where we're more than doubling down because we're literally only a year-end, and there's just so much opportunity ahead of us, and we're actually seeing the green shoots. The other, Alex, is integrating Credit Karma as part of the payroll platform. So if you want to ultimately get earlier access to your money, you can put your money on a Credit Karma Money account, that's another area. But the primary focus has been creating this one consumer platform between TurboTax and Credit Karma. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Brent Thill : Sasan, you've had some pretty healthy price hikes from the full-service solution, anywhere between 25% and 50% from last year's tax season. I'm just curious if you could just give us a sense of how that's resonating and they are fairly healthy in terms of hike. What -- in terms of just the justification of how big that was, can you just walk through what drove that decision on the pricing side? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure, Brent. As we always do, we have pricing principles, and we run a lot of tests, and there are multiple holistic things that we did in our lineup this year. And let me start with where you didn't ask the question because it's relevant to the overall answer to your question. One, for our free customers, we actually expanded it to include student loans for free and refund transfer for free. That was one very important decision that we made. When we looked at our TurboTax Live platform to continue to really accelerate bringing more customers into the category from prior assisted, we also, for simple filers, announce, you can do it anyway you wish, do it yourself or with a live platform for a certain time period and you pay nothing. And we like the progress and the impact that we're seeing there. The third is we ran a lot of tests for TurboTax Live and particularly full service and what we learned in some ways, unsurprisingly, is price is not a big factor. It's about confidence and access to an expertise. And what we realized is having early season pricing and then later season pricing didn't really have much of an impact. So one, there is no early or late season pricing. It's one flat pricing. And two, we had a lot of room to move up on pricing, and we made a decision based on a lot of testing to move the price up. So those were a few strategic decisions that we've made. And as we back-test our decisions, it's playing out exactly as we thought, which is these are not really that price-sensitive customers, although they love our price versus other alternatives. It's more, can I get access to the expert that I want? And can I get -- confidently have somebody to get my taxes done for me? And that's what we're seeing. Operator : Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : I almost apologize for the question, Sasan, but the Desktop is an area that we understand it's not your focus, et cetera. But like you just keep reporting actually numbers that are better. Can you talk -- better than you talked to. Can you talk a little bit about some of the drivers there in the sustainability? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. I think I'll just say 2 things. One, these are resilient customers and they continue to love their Desktop products, and they always surprise us relative to wanting to come back to desktop. And really, that's a simple answer to your question on what we continue to see. I think the second thing that we're very excited about and so I would say our -- the majority of our customers is really moving to a subscription-based approach where they can leverage a lot of the services that we now create in the cloud, and that will drive even a higher subscription element of our business and it will also give our customers the ability to access more features and functionalities and that's something that we started rolling out this year and will be primarily subscription-based as we look into the future. Kim Watkins : If I could add 2 things to that, Raimo, just to remind you of some things that were mentioned in the script, too. The big growth driver in the quarter was Desktop Enterprise, which grew low double digits in the second quarter, and that's up from high single digits in the first quarter. Similar to what Sasan mentioned, that was -- that specifically for the Desktop Enterprise with customer growth and price increases there. So really something to consider. That's the piece that's growing within that. And then longer term, we're not expecting this business to decline, especially headwinds from the subscription model transition in the second half of this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Sasan, I wanted to ask you a little bit about Credit Karma. Last year was just an amazing year in terms of the number of credit cards issued, and it seems like credit card issuers really battling for customers. I'm wondering, in your opinion, does that cause any comparison issue for you guys as you look at this year? And do you see that demand waning at all? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Kartik, thanks for your question. If you recall, probably a couple of quarters ago, Michelle and I both talked about the fact that we expect a tapering of originations in the second half of the year, we would expect to continue to see strength because of our execution and because of Lightbox and the fact that we really deliver personalized experiences, which is good for members and good for partners, but we expect a tapering of origination. And we haven't seen the type of tapering that we thought we would see, which is why we continue to see the strength that we're experiencing and what we would expect in the second half of the year. Kartik Mehta : And then just one on tax, so from a competitive standpoint, have you seen anything that you're surprised by that competitors are doing that -- ones that would say to you, hey, we need to make any changes? Just any changes that you're surprised by from a competitive standpoint? Sasan Goodarzi : Part of our playbook is, as a company is we do a lot of scenario planning customer back, and it's really primarily focused on making sure we're obsessed with our customers and what other alternatives could be presented to our customers that could be far more compelling. So just as part of our playbook, we do that quite well, and we particularly are probably one of the best at it across the company in tax. So just know that, that is part of our playbook. And I would just tell you that this year, we've probably been the least surprised. And so no, it is not -- there's no surprises that's informing anything differently that we're doing the rest of the season. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Brad Reback : Sasan, obviously, it's a difficult hiring environment out there. Do you guys feel pretty good about where you are for the Live product to meet demand here in the next couple of weeks from a headcount perspective? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thanks, Brad. The very short answer is absolutely. We actually, believe it or not, feel the best this year than we have in prior years just because we've gotten so good at what we need to do. We're several years into this and because many experts actually want to be on our platform. So we are absolutely fine on hiring. Operator : At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over for any remarks. Sasan Goodarzi : All right. Excellent. Well, listen, everyone, thank you so much for all of your wonderful questions. Be safe out there. Take good care of yourselves, and we look forward to talking to you in May. Thank you, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Latif and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Latif. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2022 conference call. I am here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2021 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I will turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I am proud of our continued momentum as we execute on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses. We have a nearly $300 billion addressable market driven by tailwinds that include shifts to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities and digital money offerings. This, combined with the team\u2019s execution, is contributing to the strength of our performance. Third quarter revenue grew 35%, including 6 points from the addition of Mailchimp. It was another strong quarter for our Small Business and Self-Employed Group with revenue up 42%, 20% organically. Credit Karma posted another quarter with revenue at an all-time high, up 48%. And I am proud of how the team executed in the Consumer Group in another unusual tax season. We are confident in our business trajectory and are raising our total Intuit revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2022. We expect to grow total company revenue 31% to 32% as our platform is in demand now more than ever. Let me now turn to tax. Our multiyear strategy is to extend our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transform the assisted category with TurboTax Live. This strategy is working. This fiscal year, we expect our share of total IRS returns to be up approximately 1 point and our share of the do-it-yourself category to increase 2 points. We\u2019re also growing average revenue per return once again. We expect customers in under-penetrated segments, including Latinx, self-employed and investors to grow double-digits in total. Within transforming the assisted category, we continue to make progress connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live. We anticipate achieving a significant milestone with TurboTax Live revenue reaching $1 billion in fiscal year 2022, growing approximately 30% and customers growing 20%. Note that last year, TurboTax Live customer growth significantly benefited from the introduction of the free basic offer. We are proud of the progress against our strategy. However, slower total IRS returns growth is resulting in expected Consumer Group revenue growth of 10% this fiscal year. We now expect overall IRS returns to decline 3% through July 31 compared to IRS returns growth of 3% to 4% the last 2 seasons. This was driven by onetime stimulus filers that did not return this season and overall IRS extensions up significantly year-over-year, with the number of TurboTax customers filing extensions nearly doubling. As a reminder, every point of IRS return growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth. We now expect the do-it-yourself category share of total IRS returns to be flat this year below our expectations after growing an average of approximately 1 point per year over the last 2 years. Our hypothesis is that the do-it-yourself category performance was weaker than we expected due to the onetime stimulus filers, approximately 30% of whom were paid customers for us last season. While the last 3 years were anything but normal, over the period, IRS returns grew on average 1 percentage per year and the do-it-yourself category gained an average of just over 0.5 point of share per year consistent with long-term trends. Looking ahead, we expect more normal total IRS returns growth. More broadly, our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation, and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, continue \u2013 connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I\u2019d like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. We continue to see strong momentum with Credit Karma, a data platform where powerful network effects solving a two-sided problem. Our vision is to unlock smart money decisions by creating an autonomous financial platform that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and connect them to insights and advice. In Credit Karma, we continue to innovate across all verticals, all proprietary Lightbox technology allows us to better personalize and connect members to the products that are right for them, providing more certainty to members and partners on the platform. We continue to see strength in credit cards and personal loans with combined Lightbox penetration remaining very high. Lightbox approximately doubles the average approval rate of members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma, making it a competitive differentiator for both our members and partners. We continue to make progress combining our capabilities to fuel the success of both TurboTax and Credit Karma. We integrated Credit Karma Money into TurboTax Live experience, more than tripling the number of TurboTax online customers who deposited their refund into their Credit Karma Money account this year. This gave them the ability to receive the refund up to 5 days earlier with direct deposits. These TurboTax customers drive Credit Karma member growth and like other Credit Karma members, get access to personalized products across the platform which accelerates engagement over time. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we continue to innovate to help customers overcome this challenge. In payments, we offer a single place where small businesses can get paid, pay others, manage money and access capital. We are seeing more customers accessing loans through QuickBooks Capital, with loan volume at record level, more than tripling year-over-year in April. We have increased discoverability and expanded eligibility in the product. This is driven by our rich data and proprietary risk models, which allows us to use our customers\u2019 data on their behalf and with their permission to offer access to loans. In addition to cash flow, getting and engaging customers, remains a significant pain point for small and mid-market businesses. With Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. We continue moving with speed as we focus on product innovation, marketing and improving conversion. First, we launched a customer\u2019s and lead tab within QuickBooks Online, which allows new and existing customers to send revenue and customer data from QBO to MailChimp in real time, where small businesses can segment customers and automate marketing campaigns based on QuickBooks data. We\u2019re also saving customers time by bringing in their contact list into Mailchimp from other partners and platforms. Second, we continue to invest in marketing. We are seeing early signs that the recent investments in paid media are driving growth in customer sign-ups across large markets like the U.S. We expect this to take time for it to translate into financial results, but we\u2019re excited about the potential. And third, we are focused on opportunities to improve conversion as we look at top of the funnel traffic to how we deliver benefits in the product for our customers. This includes highlighting product benefits as soon as customers enter the product, improving the checkout page experience and streamlining in-product navigation. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. During the quarter, we launched in Canada, the first market outside of the U.S., expanding the geographic reach of this offering. Accelerating innovation and executing our strategy starts with our employees. I\u2019m proud to share that we were Fortune\u2019s 100 Best Companies to Work For list for the 21st year in a row, this year, proudly ranking #11. We remain focused on creating an environment where our employees can bring their whole selves to work and do the best work of their lives, which is reflected in our employee retention rate that is above our peers. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our long-term business strategy. Our strong business fundamentals, including our balance sheet, our speed of innovation and the demand for our platform continues to put Intuit in a position of strength. In the current macro environment, the benefits of our platform are more important than ever. We are proud to be the platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $5.6 billion, up 35%, including 6 points from the addition of Mailchimp, GAAP operating income of $2.4 billion versus $1.9 billion last year, non-GAAP operating income of $2.9 billion versus $2.2 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.28 versus $5.30 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $7.65 versus $6.07 last year. On May 4, we entered into a settlement agreement with the State Attorneys General regarding our advertising practices related to free tax preparation. This resulted in a $141 million onetime charge in our fiscal third quarter. Under the terms of the settlement, we admitted no wrongdoing. We are pleased to put this issue behind us so we can continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions for our customers. Excluding the settlement charge, our fiscal third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin would have been 250 basis points higher, and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.37 and $0.38 higher, respectively. Turning to the business segments, Consumer Group revenue was $3.2 billion, up 32%, reflecting the earlier IRS tax filing deadline this year. I\u2019m proud of our execution this season as we expect to gain share and grow our average revenue per return. There are four primary drivers of our consumer business. This data reflects our expectations through July 31, 2022 versus the prior year through July 31, 2021. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. We now expect total returns to decline 3% this year, below our original expectations. Every point of IRS returns growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to be flat by the end of the year, also below our expectations. The third driver is our share. We expect our share of total IRS returns to expand approximately 1 point this year, and our share of the DIY category to be up 2 points excluding users of the TurboTax Free File offering in prior year periods. The fourth is average revenue per return, which we expect to increase this year, driven by a mix shift to TurboTax Live and our premier offering used by investors as well as fewer free customers. As a result of the weaker IRS returns, we now expect total customer growth of 1%, including TurboTax Online paying customer growth of 8% this year. We expect the base of customers paying us nothing in our commercial-free offering to decline 11% this year to just over 13 million from over 14 million last year. This was driven by onetime stimulus filers that did not return this season, approximately 30% of whom we\u2019re paying customers. We now expect Consumer Group revenue growth of approximately 10% in fiscal 2022 versus our prior guidance of 10% to 11%, reflecting the decline of total IRS returns I mentioned earlier. We continue to expect Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long term. Turning to the ProConnect Group, revenue grew 10% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. For the full year, we now expect ProConnect Group revenue growth of 4% to 5%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 42% during the quarter or 20% on an organic basis, excluding $257 million in revenue from Mailchimp. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 67% or 31% excluding MailChimp. With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold : grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 32% in fiscal Q3, driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 121% in fiscal Q3. Excluding MailChimp, online services revenue grew 28%. MailChimp revenue recorded in online services was $257 million in the quarter, and this was in line with our expectations. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. Within payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally. Total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 221% in fiscal Q3 on a constant currency basis and 29% on an organic basis, excluding MailChimp. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is online ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 3% in the third quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-teens, driven by strong customer growth and price increases. Longer term, we don\u2019t expect the desktop business to be a growth driver for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. Moving on to Credit Karma, revenue grew 48% to $468 million in Q3, another record revenue quarter, driven primarily by growth in average revenue per monthly active user. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by personal loans and credit cards and to a lesser extent, auto loans. We are developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time. As Sasan shared earlier, we saw a more than tripling in the number of TurboTax Online customers who deposit their refund into their Credit Karma Money account this year. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Turning to our financial principles, we remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As we have shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on being an AI-driven expert platform. These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment. Our first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can\u2019t invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $489 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, payable July 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, we are raising our full year fiscal 2022 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to reflect the momentum we\u2019ve seen throughout the year in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and Credit Karma. Our updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue of $12.623 billion to $12.674 billion, growth of 31% to 32% and including Mailchimp as of November 1 and a full year of Credit Karma, up from prior guidance of 26% to 28% growth. Excluding $765 million to $770 million in Mailchimp revenue, growth of 23% to 24%, up from prior guidance of 18% to 20% growth; GAAP earnings per share of $6.95 to $7.01, down from prior guidance of $7 to $7.17 \u2013 excuse me, $7.16. We now expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 20% this year, up from 18% previously, non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.68 to $11.74, up from prior guidance of $11.48 to $11.64. Our fiscal 2022 guidance includes the impact of the $141 million onetime charge related to the State Attorneys General settlement. Excluding this charge, our expected GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin would be approximately 110 basis points higher in fiscal 2022, above our prior guidance. Expected fiscal 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would be approximately $0.37 and $0.38 higher, respectively. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 includes a revenue decline of 8% to 9%, reflecting the earlier tax filing deadline this year versus last year, GAAP loss per share of $0.53 to $0.47 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.94 to $1. You can find our full Q4 and fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Michelle. And before closing, I wanted to mention the leadership changes in our Consumer Group that we shared in our earnings release today. Effective May 31, Greg Johnson, General Manager of the Consumer Group, will step down as the leader of Intuit\u2019s Consumer business to become CEO of McAfee. Varun Krishna, Senior Vice President and General Manager of TurboTax Growth Products, will succeed Greg as the General Manager of the Consumer Group. Greg has done a tremendous job driving growth for our Consumer business, and I couldn\u2019t be happier for this next chapter for him. Intuit is well known for developing world-class leaders and Greg is no exception. McAfee is lucky to have him. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t be more excited to welcome Varun as the Consumer Group\u2019s next General Manager. With over 7 years of experience leading commercial and product innovation for TurboTax, Varun is perfectly suited for leading Consumer Group\u2019s next phase of growth. We are seeing continued momentum across the entire company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform that is powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. I\u2019m proud of the team and how we\u2019ve delivered for our customers so far this year. And with that, let\u2019s now \u2013 go now to your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s very impressive to see strong momentum in Credit Karma as well as small business and how you raise the guidance. So Sasan, I\u2019m wondering given this geopolitical uncertainty and even some concern about any macro slowdown, how is Credit Karma positioned in terms of growth and also in your small business segment? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. I\u2019ll break down your question sort of in three parts, given that we are a platform company with sort of a great profile of businesses. I\u2019ll start with tax. I know that was not part of your question, but it\u2019s important to start there, which is tax is sort of very resilient in any type of an environment, and it\u2019s more than 30% of the company\u2019s revenue when you look at both TurboTax and our ProTax business. In small business, there is a flight to digitization to manage your cash flow. And just I would remind us that we are now fundamentally a growth and money center platform for small businesses. And so there is a flight to be able to manage your cash flow on our platform. And the two stats that I would use that are very recent and sort of the here and now, one, our loan business had a record high volume in April. It was 3x higher than it\u2019s been year-over-year. And our charge volume continues to be strong. As of last month and even in this last week, our charge volume has been growing north of 30%. And I use those a couple of stats just more as proof points in terms of the importance of our platform in these unique times. And when it comes to Credit Karma, first of all, on the demand side, I would say that when you get into tougher recessionary times, the demand for the products on our Credit Karma platform actually grows. Now it\u2019s \u2013 the discussion is about the supply side. And in fact, with our partners, there is a flight to quality. This is where the power of the data that we have on our customers\u2019 behalf and Lightbox that I\u2019ve been talking about over the last couple of years come into play because with our partners and the flight to quality putting their Credit Karma models on our platform, they are actually able to really get the kind of quality customers that they need. And so it\u2019s just sort of a perfect match between members and partners, which is, by the way, why we saw the strength this past quarter of 48% growth and why the platform continues to be very resilient in these times. So those would be, I would say, the headlines I would share with you about our platform being in need at probably some very unique times where our customers need us most. Siti Panigrahi : Sasan, thanks for covering the tax, but just a quick follow-up on TurboTax Live Full Service. This is the second year. What sort of trend you have seen? Do you see more share gain from the assisted category or your own customer now moving more into full service kind of product? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, great question. I would just start with \u2013 there is 86 million customers that are in the assisted category and the TAM is over at $20 billion, and we hit a major milestone this year of delivering $1 billion of revenue with TurboTax Live growing at 30%. So we are in the very early stages of what\u2019s possible in growth and penetration in the assisted category. That is really the long-term really bright spot and future growth for TurboTax, which we are very excited about. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : You are very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] calling in for Kirk. Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. Maybe one for Michelle. Given some of the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, is there anything that you changed in terms of the forecasting process just to account for some greater uncertainty moving forward? Thank you. Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, thanks for the question. Yes, as we see the macro environment unfolding, one of the good things that Sasan has shared is we really don\u2019t see a lot of \u2013 have not seen a lot of impact to our business. It is one of the things that we are continuing to look for. But given the way our business works, the platform that we have, and really the need that small businesses and consumers have in times like these, even more for our products and our platform, we don\u2019t anticipate seeing an impact. And so we\u2019re always looking and to make sure to see what\u2019s happening, but we haven\u2019t really changed anything with our forecast at this point in time in any \u2013 as you can see with our guidance that we\u2019ve given. Sasan Goodarzi : And the only thing I would add is majority of our business, if not most of it, is highly predictable and for the most part, in some areas, it\u2019s subscription, pretty much most of small business, which includes Mailchimp\u2019s subscription. So the predictability is quite high, and we are very sort of data-driven in terms of what we look at daily to see our performance. And as Michelle said, that, combined with the indicators that we see, the demand remains very strong on our platform. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you both. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and really nice quarter. Maybe \u2013 sorry, that was a question for Michelle. Just a point of clarification. So am I reading this right that we should add that \u2013 or not add, but like the $0.38 is not included in your guide for the full year. So if it wasn\u2019t for that settlement, the EPS guide would be like $12.06 to $12.12? Is that the right way to read it? Michelle Clatterbuck : That\u2019s exactly right, Keith. Because of the nature of the charge, the one-time, it\u2019s not an impact to the underlying structural part of our business. We wanted to make sure that you could see really what is the business driving. And so yes, it actually would have been higher. It would have been the $0.37 higher on GAAP and $0.38 higher on non-GAAP for EPS for the full year. Keith Weiss : Got it. Got it. That wasn\u2019t my question, it was just a clarification. So the question is pace of operating margin expansion on a go-forward basis? Because it does seem like you\u2019re outperforming your original expectation for FY \u201822. You talked about previously an ability to sort of have a consistent cadence of operating margin expansion on a go-forward basis. I think you talked about maybe like 100 basis points a year going forward. Does that change at all given sort of the outperformance you saw in FY \u201822? Or do you think that\u2019s still achievable on a go-forward basis? Michelle Clatterbuck : First of all... Sasan Goodarzi : Maybe Keith, I\u2019ll get \u2013 I didn\u2019t know it was for Michelle. Michelle, go for it. Michelle Clatterbuck : I\u2019m sorry, I thought it was for me. Sasan Goodarzi : Well, you know how I am. I just jump in. You go. Keith Weiss : Margin questions are for Michelle? Sasan Goodarzi : Alright. Alright. I\u2019ll be quiet. Michelle Clatterbuck : Except that I lose my voice and can\u2019t talk. But no, you know we have our financial principles, first of all. So our financial principles to grow revenue double digits and grow operating income faster than revenue. We haven\u2019t set out any target for what that margin expansion might look like over time. But we do see that it is possible because of the benefits of being on \u2013 having the platform that we do. And so besides being able to innovate more quickly and deliver for our customers, we do continue to see those opportunities as you\u2019re seeing this year that we can really leverage key services and capabilities across our business whether that be in technology or customer success or sales and marketing, we do continue to see an opportunity there, although we have not given any type of specific range of what that expansion might look like. Keith Weiss : Got it. Got it. And then for Sasan, I\u2019m hoping to get an update on Mailchimp. It\u2019s \u2013 you saw a nice sequential improvement this quarter, and I think that\u2019s going to surprise a lot of investors. It\u2019s definitely an area where investors have the most degree of caution. And I think somebody that comes from some of the data points that we look at, we look at like Google trends, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be trending higher. I know a lot of my clients look at credit card panel data, and that has been pretty weak. But the performance has been, I think, a little bit better than expectation. Can you give us an update on how Mailchimp is doing and how far into that integration we are? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. I\u2019ll tell you, Keith, we are probably more excited today as we sit here than we were even when we made the announcement because now we\u2019re into the work. And I would just say that we are delivering against our expectations and our belief and confidence that is the best is yet to come. And very specifically, we\u2019re focused on creating a growth platform. So in one place, a customer can grow and run their business. And we now have proof points of the things that we\u2019re starting to deliver like the customers and lead tab that\u2019s in QuickBooks, where now we are transferring all of your customer and revenue data into a Mailchimp. The second thing is really looking back the investment in marketing and knowing where to invest has been underwhelming. And that excites us as we look ahead, we\u2019ve got some of our best marketing leadership teams now in Mailchimp and the investments that we are making in terms of one go-to-market strategy, pricing principles and how to invest is that we\u2019re starting to see some green shoots. And with the investments that we\u2019re making, and we\u2019re quite good at these sorts of things. We foresee the financial results will be forthcoming and then last but not least, both going upmarket to mid-market and international. In fact, we will talk more about this at Investor Day, but we have refreshed our international strategy, and a big part of that will actually include Mailchimp because of the fact that half of their business came from outside of the U.S. really with little effort. So that was a long way of saying we\u2019re quite excited about our momentum and we\u2019re very excited about the trajectory of the business and sort of the best in terms of growth is yet to come. And I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be able to pick up the performance of Mailchimp through Google Trends. Keith Weiss : Got it. Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Very welcome, Keith. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Byun : Hi, thank you. This is John Byun on for Brent Thill. Just kind of actually not a macro question, I wonder if you could remind us how you performed in past recessions and how it might be different for you this time. Obviously, you have Mailchimp and you have Credit Karma, but on the plus or minus side. Then I have a follow-up. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. First of all, the last recession that we look back on, we actually grew 4%, and this is \u2013 I think this was in 2008, and we grew 4% where most of our peers actually declined. And so we perform well in recessionary times. I would also then go on to say we are a totally different company today than when we were in 2008 in terms of the strength of our platform today versus in 2008. One, we now have a platform and by definition, we\u2019re in the cloud, whereas back then, we\u2019re primarily desktop. We are in the cloud where the tailwinds around digitization, a shift to a virtual world, the shift to online, digitization to drive managing cash flow is actually essential for customers. And then you combine that with what I mentioned earlier with our Credit Karma platform where demand is actually higher in recessionary time. And our strength of our data and Lightbox capability makes them a great flight to quality for our partners, which is the current strength that we are seeing. So we\u2019d actually expect to perform better if it was exactly like-for-like compared to 2008. But nevertheless, those were the stats of the past recession and how we performed and we\u2019re in a much stronger position today. John Byun : That\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And then just another quick one, on Mailchimp, just wanted to see if you could update us on the progress in terms of where the growth is coming from? Is it still mainly from e-mail marketing or are you getting more traction with the broader CRM suite and the side builders in e-commerce? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. I would say the majority of really the growth is still coming from just the viral word-of-mouth nature of the platform and we are building out the capabilities of the platform. One of the biggest things that we\u2019ve learned now having the business as part of the company, is how much capabilities the platform has the customers don\u2019t know about and how many customers don\u2019t even know about Mailchimp because we\u2019ve really never invested in marketing. And so a lot of what we\u2019re seeing is sort of just continued word of mouth because of the benefits that it delivers. With our investments in the product that I mentioned a moment ago, the investments that we are making strategically in marketing and that will accelerate over time. And then doing so going upmarket and international, we expect that will be accretive to growth as we head into the future. But most of it right now is just, I would say, word of mouth. John Byun : Great. Thanks very much. Sasan Goodarzi : You are very welcome. Operator : Next question comes from Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, thank you. This is [indiscernible] for Brad. I guess my first question is, can you compare and contrast any differences in demand you might be seeing between QuickBooks and Mailchimp, if at all? I know in the enterprise category, you kind of see a division of spend between the two, but I was kind of wondering if that\u2019s kind of different with \u2013 given you guys kind of focus around SMB? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. First and foremost, I would start with \u2013 these are both subscription-based businesses and together, they create magic. A part, one helps you manage your cash flow, which is QuickBooks, the other one helps you actually grow your business. And so I would say that the demand and the strength of the demand, it\u2019s fairly consistent for those customers, whether they are new or customers that have been in business for a while that realize that they have to find a way to market to their existing customers, to be able to grow with them and grow their wallet share and also find ways to market their business on different channels, whether it\u2019s their website, whether it\u2019s on Instagram, Facebook, Amazon, Etsy. And so the demand is consistent. It depends on what you\u2019re trying to do. And all businesses are trying to both grow their business and be able to run their business and manage the cash flow. And what they don\u2019t have is the platform in one place nor do they have the data. And that\u2019s why bringing Mailchimp and QuickBooks together will, over time, actually drive higher retention, a higher expansion of services and wallet share and also higher penetration because what we can do together is hard to do a part. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. And then turning to TurboTax real quick, when I think of some of my favorite differentiators for the product, I think of just auto importing the investments or TT Live and tool service. But it seems like a lot of the R&D work for those are done. So I guess my question is, where are like the incremental investments going in terms of R&D for TurboTax now? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. First of all, there is no destination to the investments. We are continuing to invest in machine learning and knowledge engineering to not only make the experts that are on our platform smarter so that we can lead how we answer questions through technology and not just through human labor. But two, in terms of how we do the matching and how we ensure that our \u2013 really our technology, the bots are engaging and answering the questions. So we\u2019re getting better at this every single day. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest in that area. I think the other thing I would say is around the money. The biggest thing that we learned this year where we\u2019re excited about next year, it\u2019s actually about everything in the assisted segment is about speed the tax is done and speed to my money. And so the integration of Credit Karma into TurboTax where you can now get early access to your refund, that\u2019s another area of investment for us because there is so much more we can do in the experience. So it\u2019s both getting you to a place where taxes are done and experts are smarter in terms of how they help you and also faster access to money and then being able to do that across very specific segments like investors, self-employed, Latinx and over time, the creator economy. So our investments will continue in those areas. And remember, we invested the platform level and at the company level. These are not just investments within TurboTax, and they also benefit us in QuickBooks Live and other areas. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s awesome color. Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. You are very welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. Congratulations, Sasan and team, spectacular results. Sasan, I think some of us, including you, will fondly remember that back in the 2008, 2009 recession, Intuit was probably the only company or one of the few companies that actually grew its revenues right through the recession. Of course, we\u2019re not calling for anything specific here, but as someone running the most admired companies with significant exposure to the SMB space, I\u2019m curious how Intuit\u2019s products are positioned in a way that it could help customers the most to be able to weather through this, ,as we all understand, combination of inflation rates, etcetera. And also, if you could \u2013 I think that\u2019s quite a question. So I\u2019ll just pause with that and hear your thoughts. Thank you once again. Congratulations. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you, Kash, and thank you for the question. I\u2019ll use sort of tangible here and now answer so it doesn\u2019t seem overly generic. I would just start with saying that we are most important in tougher times than just in good times. And I\u2019ll start with small business. There is an accelerated flight to digitization to manage your cash flow as a small business in these tougher times. And we\u2019re seeing that now. And the example I think I used earlier, but is worth bringing up again is in the month of April, our volume of QuickBooks Capital loans was at an all-time high and 3x higher than the same time last year, where times were much, much better compared to what environment all of us see today. And the other is our payments volume. Just in the last month, in the last week, we are growing north of 30%. This is our payments volume. So I use those as tangible examples just to state that we have truly become a growth platform and a money center for small businesses. And in times like this, we are in need, more than ever, because our capabilities are so different than the last time we were in a recession, because we have all the capabilities with Mailchimp and QuickBooks to grow your business and help you with your cash flow. And I will just maybe pause there with small business, and I will remind us that tax, both our ProTax and TurboTax business is more than 30% of the company, and it\u2019s resilient in very tough times because people have to do their taxes. And then last but not least is demand is higher in recessionary times on the Credit Karma platform. And there is actually a flight to quality. And based on our data and Lightbox capability that\u2019s proprietary, more and more partners are wanting to be on Lightbox because they can actually control the quality of their offers, and it makes our platform even more demand, which is what you saw in the last quarter. And so I would foresee that playing forward, which I think was the nature of your question, we are the best positioned to serve consumers and small businesses in tough times and good times. Kash Rangan : Got it. That\u2019s just to clarify. Small business formation that doesn\u2019t affect Intuit, so you \u2013 they probably lag before you get to the point where they could prefer to buy two products. So, should we be concerned \u2013 how concerned should we rather that small business creation might come to a standstill during the recession, how that might affect Intuit? That\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. I wouldn\u2019t be concerned at all. If you look at our history, when the formations were high, when the formations were low or negative, it really \u2013 that\u2019s not the driver of the long-term or short-term health of the business. And so it is not something we worry about. It\u2019s actually not something we track. It\u2019s not something we talk about a lot. And so you all start asking questions, got it. So, I would just say that it is not an area of concern for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Jester of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Daniel Jester : Hey, great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On TurboTax Live, just can you help us understand how much of the growth this year was from DIY customers transitioning to TurboTax Live versus how many were kind of net new to the platform this year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you for the question. We don\u2019t break out the specifics, but I will take you back to why we love the TurboTax Live platform. One, there is more than 10 million people in the assisted segment that actually a trip and go to another person to help them with assistance within \u2013 and these are directional numbers. Within TurboTax, there is probably more than 10 million people that log in, but never actually finish their taxes. And then there is switching that happens back and forth between doing it yourself and then getting assistance. The reason I bring up those three figures is there is actually a lot of sort of movement in the tens of millions in each category and across the category between do-it-yourself and the systems. And it\u2019s all driven by a lack of confidence. Can I do this myself, did I do it right. And so when we look at the TurboTax Live platform and in fact, I would say TurboTax as a whole, that\u2019s why we are now a platform where you can do it yourself, we can do it with you or we can do it for you across the platform. So, our growth in TurboTax Live comes from all those three areas. They are those that switch from assisted, they are those that would have left DIY that now stay with us and vice versa. It helps us with a funnel metrics. So, that is the driver of where we are in TurboTax Live. That has been the driver looking backwards, and it will continue to be the driver looking ahead. Daniel Jester : Great. That\u2019s really helpful context. Thank you. And then just to stick with tax, the comment you made about you had 3x the number of TurboTax users who deposit their refund in a Credit Karma account. I wonder how much of a leading indicator actually is that? Do you track their balances, or is there any color you can share about what that can mean in the future? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. First of all, we are really focused on the money benefit for our customers. And for those that live paycheck to paycheck to get five days early access to their refund is really meaningful. So, I am super proud of our team for what they are doing here and \u2013 because it really changes lives. With that said, we believe our hypothesis is, one, over time, this will actually help with TurboTax retention. These customers become new Credit Karma members. And then as you know, Credit Karma and the Credit Karma platform, we are really good at leveraging what we know about you with your permission to then really match you to financial products that are right for you and find ways to save money and get out of debt. So, it\u2019s new customers on a platform that already has over 120 million members that over time, as we engage them, we will be able to monetize. We do watch their behaviors. Do they keep the money on a Credit Karma Money, do they drain it, what we can help them with in terms of things they can do with that money to be able to build their credit. So, it\u2019s really \u2013 it truly feeds into the network effect of delivering benefits and the customers coming back for more benefits. Daniel Jester : Great. Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Strecker Backe : Thank you. This is Strecker Backe on for Alex. So, just with the success that you and with seeing with Credit Karma and Mailchimp, has it changed your view on doing additional M&A over the next 12 months to 18 months? And are even making you consider more of these larger transformational deals? So, can you just give us an update on how you are thinking about M&A right now? And would you say that maybe your \u2013 resource-wise, you are very focused on integrating these companies still or you have some room to take on additional deals if it\u2019s the right deal? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thanks for the question. First, I will start by saying our principles around acquisitions have not changed. For us, it is all about time to market and having a platform that can fundamentally power the prosperity of consumers and small businesses that we serve. And secondarily, we expect excellence from ourselves and our teams, and we expect these acquisitions to be building the kind of momentum that we are building, and we are \u2013 we have a set of mechanisms within our Intuit operating system where we monitor very closely our progress against the deliverables, and I mean the product and marketing deliverables and the talent on the team and their engagement to really ensure that things are on track. And really, everything with both of these acquisitions is about acceleration. We only integrate as long as it accelerates. And so we have a very I would say, good playbook in terms of how to make acquisitions. And in both cases, when you look at Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we bought the capabilities and the incredible talent because they do things that we are not great at and there are things we do that they are not great at and together as a family, we can create magic. So, with all of that said, it doesn\u2019t accelerate or decelerate what we are looking at from a time-to-market perspective, they are both on track in terms of our expectations. And we are very discrete in terms of how we allocate mind share and resources to both of these assets. And frankly, the biggest hindrance for future acquisitions is how good their management team is. It is not our mind share or our resources. So, that\u2019s the way we think about it. Strecker Backe : Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, thanks for taking my question. This is Bob and on for Brad and congrats on a strong tax year despite the IRS headwinds. Just sticking with tax quickly, now that you have had a second year of more basic live SKUs under your belt, how should we think about the rate and pace of customers shifting from maybe a more basic SKU to deluxe premier? And how that compares to the typical trajectory that you might see on the traditional TurboTax Online side of things? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, it\u2019s a really good question. First of all, I would tell you, having sort of experimented with our TurboTax Live basic offer is a good experiment and it worked. The biggest thing that I would tell you that we learned in this \u2013 particularly this last year is what really matters is speed to your taxes done with an expert and speed the money. And that is an area where we are doubling down going into next year because the majority of these customers, they want their taxes done right by an expert or if you do it for them and they want access to their money as soon as possible, both of which we can deliver on. And so really, in that context, folks that use an assisted method generally have more complex situation. And we would expect, over time, the higher SKUs that we have to play a bigger role when it comes to TurboTax Live. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s helpful there. And Sasan, just to the earlier point you made earlier on the call just on international. Have you seen any change in terms of trends of new customer growth or even top of funnel with either QuickBooks and Mailchimp when you look internationally versus maybe more in the U.S.? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. What is consistent is what I have shared before, which is, I would say, U.S. and Canada, and I will just use COVID as an example, coming out of \u2013 we are not out of COVID, but coming out of sort of the world shutting down, bounce back much faster than the other countries that we are in. In the UK, in Australia and France, there has been so many sort of start, stop, start-stop, that it\u2019s impacted the sort of building momentum in that country. And I don\u2019t mean to us, I just mean how consumers and small businesses thinking about managing their financial life. So, they are starting to bounce back, but they, for sure, are tracking behind the U.S. and Canada. And again, I will say that what it really excites us looking ahead is the possibilities to help customers grow their customers in small business with Mailchimp. That will be a bigger part of our future as we roll out our strategy and game plan and we believe that, that will be over the long-term, accretive to our growth. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks very much and congratulations. Sasan, I want to dig into \u2013 this is kind of an overriding question on the cadence of the tax season, and want to dig into the extension. You mentioned that the IRS has elevated extensions this year and you do as well. Could you just speak a little bit more to that? And address might there be any variability, good or bad, relative to what you are expecting for the volume for the full year just on where your fiscal year ends and potential extension? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Scott. Well, first of all, I will start with the headline, which is there could be. But now let me give you more specifics with the guidance and what we are talking to you about is for our fiscal year, which is through the end of July. And I will start at the top. The IRS returns through July, we are observing that it will be down three points, and it\u2019s driven by stimulus filers that didn\u2019t come back. About 30% of them were actually paying customers and IRS extensions being up. And in our base, they are nearly doubled. And so we have made some assumptions in terms of what will happen through July. And of course, we will talk to you all more as we talk about our guidance for next fiscal year because we have not made those estimates, and we won\u2019t communicate it today because our focus was what we communicate to you through July. But certainly, the extensions, most of those customers at some point come back, and \u2013 but we have not estimated what that will be after July. And we do expect just \u2013 so it said again that IRS total returns will be more normal next year because, in essence, this year, we are digesting what happened in the last 2 years because of all the stimulus filers and we would expect it to be more back to the normal flat or up as we look into the future. Scott Schneeberger : Yes. Certainly, that would make sense. The \u2013 and just as a follow-up, still in tax. When Michelle has given her part on revenue per return, she called out TurboTax Live in premier. So, in the Latinx self-employed investment category, I assume that\u2019s probably a little bit more weighted that double-digit growth on the premier, the investor category. Just curious, is that so? And also for the Latinx self-employed and investor group, how sustainable is that growth? You have got really nice growth for a few years. Is there a long runway to that? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. For sure. Let me start with the latter part of your question. When we look at the assisted category where there is more than a $20 billion TAM, and by the way, there is another $10 billion TAM, which is business tax that we have not talked about. So, in total, it\u2019s $30 billion. TurboTax Live is $1 billion. And so we have got a lot of runway. And as you have heard me talk in prior years, we are sort of in the early days, and we got a 10-year run here, hopefully, now that we have divulged how big TurboTax Live is, you can see how much runway we have. So, there is a lot of runway there. There is also a lot of runway in our underpenetrated segments. We are truly just getting started with Latinx, self-employed and the investor segment because we are actually under-shared in those segments based on all the data that we see. And so when we look at those segments, which is both do-it-yourself and in the assisted segment, we also have an equal runway. And we believe, down the road, the creator community \u2013 the creator segment will continue to become a larger part of those that choose to do taxes, and that\u2019s an area where we will be focused over time as well. So, that was a long answer to your short question. I think the headline I would leave you with is, yes, there is a runway for sure. And it\u2019s a multiyear runway in all of those areas. Scott Schneeberger : Okay, great. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Kartik Mehta : Good evening Sasan. Just going down the tax segment a little bit, I think Michelle said that you expect the DIY segment to be flat. And I am wondering, I know the last few seasons have been a little bit different. And I am wondering as we move forward to next year, what you would expect over the next 2 years, 3 years for the DIY segment growth to be? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thanks for the question. And I will start with the first part of what you led with. When we look at the last 3 years and even more historically, IRS returns has been up about 1% and the DIY category has grown about 0.5 point. And so when you look at the last 3 years with all the anomalies, that also holds true. And the way we keep score is our share of the total IRS returns with respect to just now the platform that we have, where you can do it yourself or we will do it for you on the other spectrum. But specifically to answer your question, we do believe over time that the DIY category will continue to grow just as it has grown historically. So, we do believe that this is just I would say, a year where we are digesting all of the anomalies in the last 2 years. Kartik Mehta : And this is on Credit Karma, you talked a little bit about how banks will \u2013 or credit card issuers will rely on Credit Karma even more during the recession. And I am wondering if you have seen any signs of banks starting to tighten credit standards and if that is a benefit yet to Credit Karma? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. We have over 120 partners on our platform and these partners, they are big and they are small. And with that as context, are always experimenting and adjusting both in good times and not so good times, their credit cycle and they jump between bands, whether they are more interested in those that have a credit band below 620, which is subprime or between 620 to 700, which is prime or near prime and then, of course, anything over 700, which is prime. And the point is, based on our platform and the demand on our platform and the supply on our platform, we see very good supply across all of the bands because of the focus areas of the partners. And so that drives the strength that we saw this last quarter, and we would expect it going forward in context of our guidance. Kartik Mehta : Alright. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Sasan, as you work to put together the fiscal \u201823 operating plan in the coming weeks and months, what type of forward indicators are you focused on internally and externally to sort of inform that decision? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Brad, great question because we are actually \u2013 we are done with our 3-year and 1-year plan and the way our cycle works is while we are in the heat of delivering this year, we finish our planning for next year. We look at a few things. One, we look at secular trends. We look at facts and figures on our platform. So, the secular trends are what I have mentioned earlier, which is a shift to using virtual solutions, an acceleration to online and omnichannel and an acceleration to using digital money platform. So, we look at secular shifts and we look at the facts and figures around the secular shifts. We then look at all the things that actually happened on our platform and our share. If I just use a couple of examples, we have over $1.5 trillion of invoices that are generated on our small business platform. But as we shared last Investor Day and of course, this number is bigger now, our payments volume was over $90 billion. And so you look at \u2013 that\u2019s a very low share. When you look at our share of the assisted category in tax, very low share, when you look at our share of financial products on Credit Karma, credit cards, personal loans, very low share. So, we look at data around our share and our performance around our share. And then we will also look at economic factors like unemployment, like default rates, like projections around the economy. By the way, we are the best projector of the economy because of the data that we see on our small business platform. So, we look at all of those things. And then the way we put in \u2013 put together our plan is sort of worst case, middle case, best case. And that\u2019s how we manage the company. And by the way, this is something that we are quite good at. And then we manage based on the data that we see, we managed to ensure that we are protecting our long-term investor investments while we deliver for today for our customers. So, that\u2019s a little bit of a snapshot in terms of how we think about it. Brad Reback : That\u2019s great. Thanks very much. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, I am not showing any further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. So, I will. Hey, thank you, everyone, for making the time. Thank you for all your wonderful questions. As I said earlier, I am super proud of our employees across the company and our partners, and it\u2019s a real privilege and honor to be able to serve our members and customers in these unique times. And so all of you be safe, be well, and we will talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins, please begin. Kim Watkins : Thanks, Chelsea. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2022 conference call. I am here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2021 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I will turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong fourth quarter, ending the year with momentum as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We continue to be focused on solving our customers\u2019 biggest problems by putting more money in their pocket, eliminating work and saving people time and ensuring that they have complete confidence in every financial decision they make. Full year revenue reached $12.7 billion, up 32%, including the addition of Mailchimp and a full year of Credit Karma. Excluding MailChimp, revenue grew 24%. Total revenue growth was fueled by 38% growth for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, which includes 16 points from Mailchimp. Consumer Group revenue grew 10%, and Credit Karma had an outstanding year with revenue of $1.8 billion, up 58% on a pro forma basis year-over-year. I am very proud of the team\u2019s performance, delivering strong growth and strong margins, which very few companies at our scale are able to achieve. I\u2019m optimistic about our strategy and opportunities for growth, especially considering an uncertain global macroeconomic environment. The Intuit platform remains mission-critical for powering our customers\u2019 prosperity. I\u2019m pleased we are guiding to another year of strong revenue growth and strong margins in fiscal year 2023. Our global AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation, and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, our 5 Big Bets are : revolutionize keep the benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. We will share more on our vision and the outcomes we\u2019re driving across each of these Big Bets next month at our Investor Day. Now let me turn to a topic that I know is top of mind for many of you, the resiliency of our business and the slowing macroeconomic environment. Our company is in a significantly different position than it was during the last recession more than a decade ago. Our platform and cloud-based offerings have significantly expanded to become the platform of choice for consumers and small businesses. Therefore, Intuit is even more mission-critical for our customers we serve. We have highly predictable reoccurring revenue and much of our business is subscription-based. Additionally, the scale of our platform along with our rich data gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators, such as growth in charge volume, number of hours employees are working and number of workers paid, bank account balances of our small business customers, credit card utilization and delinquency rates for members. This allows us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. Let me share how we think about our business in context of a mild recession. To start, in fiscal year 2022, 51% of our revenue came from the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, 35% from our Consumer and ProTax businesses and 14% from Credit Karma. First on tax, our tax businesses are very resilient, and we do not expect a mild recession to have any significant impact. Next, with Small Business and Self-Employed Group, QuickBooks and Mailchimp are mission-critical for our customers whose livelihood depends on our platform. In fiscal year 2022, approximately 80% of the Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue was subscription-based. As a reminder, Mailchimp is also primarily subscription-based which adds to the scale of our subscription volume. The approximately 20% is transactional-based and includes revenue from QuickBooks payments, capital and per employee pricing for time tracking and payroll. In a mild recessionary environment, we may see an impact on these transactional businesses. In Q4, we did not see any impact. This demonstrates how mission-critical our platform is, especially in this environment. Finally, turning to Credit Karma. This is the business that could be most impacted by weakening economic environment. As a reminder, this business represents 14% of Intuit\u2019s revenue in fiscal year 2022. While we expect member engagement to be strong in any economic environment, our financial institution partners could tighten access to credit. In Q4, we experienced increased volatility in personal loans. Many partners that securitized loans are facing a more challenging funding environment as interest rates rise. For context, personal loans represent just over a third of Credit Karma\u2019s revenue in fiscal year 2022. Although several personal loan partners tightened underwriting during the quarter, we were able to offset some of this with volume from other partners. This demonstrates the power of the platform. In credit cards, we have not seen any significant impact. We continue to monitor delinquency rates, which we view as a leading indicator for future credit card origination trends. While delinquency rates have increased slightly, they remain near historical lows. We expect credit cards to be less negatively impacted by a mild recession than personal loans. In the mild recession of \u201801-02, credit card originations declined only a few points. And for context, credit cards represent nearly half of credit card revenue in fiscal year 2022. We do expect Lightbox to continue to be a differentiator for Credit Karma as this technology allows lenders to deploy their targeting models in an encrypted environment and leverage thousands of anonymized financial attributes related to Credit Karma members and TurboTax customers. This provides more certainty to members and partners on the platform as recommendations are personalized. Currently, no one else can replicate this. Partners usage of Lightbox at the end of fiscal year 2022 was at an all-time high, representing nearly 70% of credit card and personal loan transactions on a combined basis. This was up nearly 15 points from the prior year. We expect Lightbox to help make Credit Karma\u2019s business more resilient in a recessionary environment. Now with that as context, the guidance we are providing today assumes current demand trends continue. Wrapping up, we feel more confident than ever in our long-term business strategy. In an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our platform are more important and mission-critical than ever. As part of our 3 and 1-year plan that the Board just approved, we are investing heavily in innovation within each of our Big Bets to deliver benefits for our customers while delivering top line growth and margin expansion given the strength of our operational playbook. Combined with our strong business fundamentals, including our balance sheet, Intuit remains in a position of strength. We\u2019re proud to be the platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2.4 billion, down 6%, reflecting the earlier IRS tax filing deadline this year, partially offset by the addition of Mailchimp; GAAP operating loss of $75 million versus operating income of $402 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $433 million versus $715 million last year; GAAP loss per share of $0.20 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.37 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.10 versus $1.97 last year. You can find our full fiscal 2022 results in our press release and on our fact sheet. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 41% during the quarter and 20% on an organic basis, excluding $265 million in Mailchimp revenue. In fiscal 2022, revenue grew 38% and 22% on an organic basis. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 66% in Q4 or 32% excluding Mailchimp and 61% for the full year or 34% excluding Mailchimp. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed group is threefold : grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 34% in fiscal Q4 driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift. In fiscal 2022, QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 33%. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking grew 116% in fiscal Q4. Excluding Mailchimp, Online Services revenue grew 29%. In fiscal 2022, QuickBooks Online Services revenue grew 107%. Excluding Mailchimp, Online Services revenue grew 34%. Mailchimp revenue included in Online Services was $265 million. Although we are making progress with this business as we accelerated our year-over-year revenue growth several points in fiscal Q4 versus when we closed the acquisition in fiscal Q2, revenue was slightly below our expectations. During the quarter, we focused on product innovation to improve conversion ahead of peak season, which starts in September, and therefore, pulled back on marketing investments. I am confident that these are the right steps to position us well as we head into Mailchimp peak season. We expect to ramp up marketing in September after these enhancements are complete. We continue to have confidence in our game plan and acceleration priorities for Mailchimp. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in Payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offering. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 193% in fiscal Q4 and 23% on an organic basis excluding MailChimp. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew low double digits in fiscal 2022 driven by price increases and customer growth. Nearly all of our desktop accounting revenue is now subscription-based, similar to our online accounting offerings. Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue grew 17% to $475 million in Q4, another record revenue quarter, driven primarily by growth in average revenue per monthly active user. Full year revenue was $1.8 billion. We\u2019ve had 2 exceptional years for this business, growing 37% in fiscal 2021 and 58% in fiscal 2022 on a pro forma basis, well above our longer-term expectations of 20% to 25%. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by credit cards and personal loans. This was partially offset by headwinds in auto insurance and home loans. As Sasan shared earlier, we are seeing increased volatility in personal loans. We continue developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Consumer Group revenue was $3.9 billion in fiscal 2022, up 10%. I\u2019m proud of our execution this season as we grew share and average revenue per return. Turning to the ProConnect Group. We reported $546 million in revenue for fiscal 2022, up 6%. Our financial principles guide our decisions remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments and $6.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $508 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $1.9 billion during fiscal 2022. The Board approved a new $2 billion repurchase authorization, giving the company a total authorization of $3.5 billion to repurchase shares. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable October 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. We have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. As a nearly 40-year-old company, we\u2019ve been through many economic cycles. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. The economic environment was a consideration as we look ahead. We have identified several levers we can pull to deliver against our financial principles in a variety of scenarios based on where we see opportunities across our platform. Many of these can be pulled in real time should the need arise in areas like marketing spend, travel, hiring and others as we progress through the year in order to maintain earnings power while positioning the company for a stronger future. We have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offense in any macro environment. These principles are intended to accelerate our innovation in the future, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from any downturn in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. Our fiscal 2023 guidance includes revenue of $14.5 billion to $14.7 billion, growth of 14% to 16%. Our guidance includes revenue growth of 19% to 20% for Small Business and Self-employed, 9% to 10% for the Consumer segment and 10% to 15% for Credit Karma. As a reminder, Credit Karma grew 58% on a pro forma basis year-over-year in fiscal 2022, well ahead of our long-term expectation of 20% to 25%. Our overall guidance assumes recent demand trends continue. Our guidance also includes GAAP earnings per share of $6.92 to $7.22, non-GAAP earnings per share of $13.59 to $13.89. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 25% in fiscal 2023. Our fiscal 2023 guidance includes stock-based compensation of $1.8 billion, an increase of 39% over fiscal 2022. Approximately 25% of this total is equity granted as part of the Credit Karma and Mailchimp transactions, and approximately 75% of this total is related to our broad-based equity program designed to attract, retain and incentivize employees. Looking ahead, we expect stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue to flatten over the next few years. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 23% to 25%, GAAP loss per share of $0.43 to $0.37 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.14 to $1.20. You can find our full Q1 and fiscal 2023 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. Going forward, we are bringing Mint and Credit Karma together under a unified personal finance strategy. Starting in fiscal Q1, we will be reporting Mint as part of the Credit Karma segment. This is reflected in the guidance I shared today but is not material to the growth rate. I also want to share an important change regarding our long-term expectations for Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth going forward. In the past, we shared with you our aspiration to achieve Online Ecosystem revenue growth of better than 30% organically over time. We first provided this expectation in fiscal 2017 when our Online Ecosystem revenue was $850 million. It comprised less than one-third of our small business ecosystem, and we were early in our journey building our online presence. Today, the Online Ecosystem is over 5x larger at $4.4 billion, and it comprised more than two-thirds of total small business revenue in fiscal 2022. This, along with the fact that the majority of the business, is now subscription-based given the shift to subscription in desktop. We believe the right measure moving forward is to look at the performance of our overall business rather than just the Online Ecosystem. We now expect total Small Business and Self-Employed long-term revenue growth of 15% to 20%, up from 10% to 15% previously. While the Online Ecosystem will continue to be our growth catalyst, we will no longer provide specific Online Ecosystem goals. With that, I will turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Michelle, thank you. As you have now heard from Michelle and I we are seeing continued momentum across the company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform. With our accelerated organic innovation and the addition of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities. We have a large TAM, secular shifts working in our favor and a highly predictable set of revenue streams. Our innovation is unlocking new opportunities for our platform and delivering truly game-changing benefits for our customers. Intuit remains a best place to work around the world, and I\u2019m proud of the team and what we\u2019ve accomplished this year. Now let me turn it over to you for any questions that you may have. Kim Watkins : Chelsea, I think we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter. Michelle, I think this is more of a question for you. For the FY \u201823 guide, you\u2019re looking for operating margins to continue to move higher or just to move higher from where they were in FY \u201822. Part of that is just kind of anniversarying the legal settlement on those part of FY \u201822. Can you talk to us about sort of the organic, if you will, or sort of like the fundamental margin improvement that you\u2019re expecting in the business in FY \u201823? How big is that and how durable on a go-forward basis if we think about the model like beyond FY \u201823? Is this a progression that we could see being more durable in terms of driving operating efficiencies, number one? And number two, in your remarks about finding levers in the business, the one that really stuck out to me is saying \u2013 you said there is levers to maintain the earnings power. So should I take that to mean that a lot of those levers have to do with the OpEx side of the equation, that there is levers you could pull to maintain margins and maintain profitability even in a weaker macro environment, if you will? Thank you. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks for your questions. Appreciate it. Yes, we are very happy to see our operating margin guidance for this coming year. It implies margin expansion of 100 basis points versus FY \u201822. And as you know, that aligns to our financial principles to be able to grow revenue double digits and operating income dollars faster than revenue. So we feel really good about that. As we look at where that\u2019s really coming from, as we\u2019ve been continuing to grow more and more as a platform over time, that really does enable us to look across the business and be able to drive efficiencies and effectiveness while driving accelerated revenue growth, which is resulting in our ability to expand margins while being able to continue to invest to really drive the accelerated revenue growth. As to how we think about that, I don\u2019t really see anything that really structurally that impacts that over time. We haven\u2019t given any longer-term expectations or long-term guidance on what margins might look like in the longer-term, but I don\u2019t necessarily see anything really structurally that prevents us \u2013 as we continue to grow as a platform that prevents us from continuing that growth. To the second part of your question as for the levers that we would pull, yes, I mean, there are a number of things that we would pull, which could be OpEx. As I mentioned, there is marketing spend or travel, hiring, other things like that, that we can pull pretty much in \u2013 a lot of those in real time to be able to impact our operating expenses and be able to maintain the margins that we have committed to. So we want to be ready. It\u2019s really kind of what we do on a day-to-day basis. We\u2019re always looking for opportunities to drive different efficiencies across the business. Keith Weiss : Awesome. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much. And congrats on strong fiscal year and a strong guide for next year. Maybe for my first question, with Mailchimp a bit disappointing, can you double-click on the actions you\u2019re taking? And what it is that gives you the confidence, its product and not the environment? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Brad, how are you? I\u2019ll take that question. First and foremost, I would share with you that we are the ones that pulled back that resulted in the performance that we just shared. So the great news is it\u2019s in our control. The second point I would make is the biggest thing that\u2019s been reaffirmed as we\u2019ve been \u2013 become one family with Mailchimp is two of the biggest problems that matters most to our customers and especially, by the way, in tougher times is being able to grow their customer base and being able to manage their cash flow. And the biggest insight that we learned as we started accelerating our marketing spend, which we had shared with all of you that we would do, is that there are conversion on gaps in the product that we felt like were critical to address and not just spend the marketing dollars without the benefit of improved conversion. And specifically, those were things like coming to the website and the number of people that we saw falling off versus what we would expect based on our experience with across the QuickBooks platform, across the Credit Karma platform, the TurboTax platform, what we believe are some best-in-class engagement and conversion. Then when you get into the product, we measure active use and making sure that you\u2019re getting into the features that you really wanted to get into and hence why you signed up for Mailchimp and even our checkout process. So those are just three illustrative examples of what I would say just basic blocking and tackling product conversion that we really wanted to double down on to make sure that we are ready for busy season. That did not take away from the priorities that we have shared about Mailchimp, which is one is to create one growth platform with QuickBooks, which we are on track to do. Two, it\u2019s a double down on international. In fact, it is now part of our refreshed international strategy to double down on helping customers grow customers with Mailchimp. And then the third is to actually go into mid-market. So what we just announced in terms of our results actually has nothing to do with the environment. It has everything to do with what\u2019s in our control and decisions that we made very explicitly to be ready for busy season. And these are playbooks that we know how to execute when it comes to product conversion. Brad Zelnick : Thank you. That makes a lot of sense, Sasan. And maybe if I can follow-up with a quick one for Michelle, Michelle, just on the long-term guidance and how we\u2019re thinking about small business going forward, and you talked about a range of 15% to 20% growth versus \u2013 from 10% to 15% but thinking more holistically. Just as I think about some of the pricing actions more recently in desktop, for example, can you just remind us, as you think about that long-term view, how should we think about pricing as a lever and pricing for value going forward? Thank you. Michelle Clatterbuck : Hi, Brad. Thanks for the question. We\u2019re really excited about being able to raise the long-term expectations for small business from 10% to 15% to 15% to 20%. I just think it goes to show, as Sasan talked about earlier, really the mission-critical nature of the products and the offerings that we have in small business. As we have increased the growth expectations, the growth algorithm overall is really still focused on the same things. It\u2019s about driving customers and it\u2019s about driving ARPC. Yes, pricing may be part of ARPC, but really, it is about focusing on driving value and how do we continue to provide offerings for customers that may have a higher ARPC, whether it\u2019s QBO Advanced, QuickBooks Live, those kinds of products. And we really are focused on pricing for value, so not just continually raising price. But once we\u2019re delivering those additional features that are providing additional value to the customers and we\u2019re bringing more innovation to the table, then we look at really should we be raising the price. But overall, very excited about the growth we see with small business. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much and thanks for taking the question. Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. One other thing that \u2013 just amplifying what Michelle just shared, and that is our reliance on price has not changed, meaning that we have an algorithm whereby price is just an element of our overall performance. And we\u2019re not relying more on price looking ahead than we did looking backwards. So just reiterating one point that Michelle made just a moment ago? Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess \u2013 so one bigger-picture kind of question, and then just one on tax. As we parse the numbers, I think the surprise factor sitting here is the guidance. And it\u2019s surprising in that it feels like it\u2019s not that conservative, I guess. And Sasan, I want to press on that a little bit. I think what you\u2019re saying is that, look, you guys have a lot of forward-looking indicators into the macro environment. And you\u2019re looking at those indicators, and they were really good in the quarter. And then I think you mentioned in your script that your guidance does not assume significant deterioration in those factors. So I guess my first question would be, why not? And why \u2013 what gives you the confidence to guide with that methodology? And then if you \u2013 what level \u2013 if you did add conservatism into the guidance for next year, where would we find it? And just tactically, maybe what is the assumption for Mailchimp growth given that variability you talked about that was a choice, I guess, in the quarter? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, Alex. Appreciate the question. I\u2019ll say a couple of things. First of all, our approach to how we run the company and our approach to guidance and how we factor things in has not at all changed. So just know that our approach is consistent with the way Intuit has always set expectations and set guidance, which is really to deliver on our commitment. That\u2019s the number one. Number two, what really informed our perspective as we look ahead is all of the indicators that we see that are forward-looking. But let me just \u2013 if I could double-click in, in a few of the areas. I\u2019ll start with tax to put that out of the way, which is no matter the environment, we\u2019re not going to expect nor have we seen in our history really any material impact in tax. That\u2019s 35% of the company. When you look at the other 51% of the company, which is small business, it\u2019s important to note that we are a very different company today than we were 3 years ago, much less 5 years ago, where small businesses are relying on our platform to run their businesses, actually their livelihood. And 80% of our revenue is subscription. And the 20% of that is transactional-based. We take the current environment and how things could play out into account as we set guidance. And the third, which is Credit Karma and 14% of the overall company revenue, we have taken the current environment and what we assume will take place into account. And most of our verticals other than Credit Karma, in fact, have seen an impact, and we have included that in our guidance. So really, that was a long way of saying we are fairly consistent across all of our segments. And we feel very good about the indicators that we see, how we view things will play out and how that informed our guidance moving forward. Alex Zukin : That\u2019s helpful. It sounds like you\u2019re reaffirming a notion of diversification and exposure. I guess, maybe just a follow-up. On the tax side, on the Consumer business, when you think about \u2013 I mean you mentioned that business is kind of much more resilient irrespective of the macro, everybody\u2019s doing their taxes. Is there any impact we should think about from recent legislation and just in general, the type of a tax season that a more volatile macroeconomic recession might \u2013 or environment might instigate? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Alex, I would say nothing more than what we\u2019ve experienced in the last couple of years. That\u2019s really the short answer. When you look at the last 2 to 3 years, environmentally, it has had probably more of an impact in the tax business than we\u2019ve seen in years. And as you know, I\u2019ve been with the company for 17 years plus, ran the tax business for 3 years. And what happened when we hit COVID, the implication on consumers, the extend the tax season, the child tax credit, there are so many things that played into the tax season in the last several years. And as we look at the year ahead, frankly, we view a much more simplified approach to the tax season. Although some of the tax laws will impact what we need to do in the product, that\u2019s what we\u2019re great at. That\u2019s what we know how to do well. So we actually see more normality as we look ahead than we experienced in the last 2 to 3 years. Alex Zukin : Got it. Can\u2019t argue with the results, guys. Congratulations. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Alex. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Hi, congratulations on a super finish to the fiscal year and also a very constructive guidance. Sasan or Michelle, when you look at the \u2013 I know you\u2019re not going to be talking about the Small Business-Online Ecosystem revenue split going forward. but it clearly looks like the business is at a point where you have two-thirds of the business coming from Online Ecosystem that\u2019s growing roughly 30% plus range, right? I think many of us are surprised that the outlook for that business, you raised the overall business at 15% to 20%. So it looks like Online Ecosystem is actually doing pretty decently, right? So in the event of a downturn \u2013 I know, Sasan, this was a question that I\u2019ve asked you on prior conference calls. But how confident are you that \u2013 of course, retaining subs is one thing, but then adding net new subscribers in a challenging economy, how confident are you that you can keep that ball rolling while continuing to have your price increases stick and, at the same time, managing retention such, because if retention goes down, then you have more pressure to add more news. So how does that mathematical equation play out during a downturn? Thank you so much and congrats. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Kash. Thank you for the compliment. I actually love the nature of your question. And let me hit on a couple of things. This is why earlier \u2013 or one of the things I talked about is we are such a different company when it comes to the small business platform than we were even 3 years ago. And so to your question of why do we have confidence around our guidance, and I know that it doesn\u2019t go past us that in this environment, we actually raised our long-term expectation. And it\u2019s because of just the \u2013 how mission-critical the platform is but the services that we have. And two examples I would share with you is, when you look at the formula that we\u2019ve shared, which is we\u2019re going to grow customers 10% to 20% and we\u2019re going to grow ARPC 10% to 20%, the two examples I would give is we have a set of offerings on our platform today that we didn\u2019t have before. QuickBooks Advanced, which is going after mid-market, which has much higher ARPC, 4x the use of sort of services, is something that we didn\u2019t have 3 to 4 years ago. And we are just early in our penetration into that TAM. And in fact, we\u2019ve not only seen no slowing but strengthening in this environment because folks want to ensure that they are on our platform to get paid faster to be able to take care of their employees. And so one is, when you look at going up mid-market, when you look at QuickBooks Live, which is really an opportunity for us to lift heads and go after non-consumption, those are offerings we have that we didn\u2019t have before that are actually higher ARPC. That\u2019s one. Two, remember, 4 to 5 years ago, our Payments business was growing 11% because of where we were on innovation in the platform. Now we\u2019re growing north of 30%. And we have about almost $2 trillion of invoices that are managed on our platform. We\u2019re growing at that rate, and our penetration is very low. And more and more customers are starting to digitize their form of payments because of the innovation on our platform, and they are already on our platform. So we have \u2013 and those are just two illustrative examples but very real examples of why we\u2019re seeing the strength that we\u2019re seeing here now and the strength and all the indicators that we see in the coming year. And I would just sort of finish with the bank box of 80% our business is subscription business. So it\u2019s highly, highly predictable. And those are the things that give us confidence as we look ahead. Kash Rangan : Tremendous dissection of what is driving your confidence. Thanks so much and we will not let Microsoft tell us anything about SMB. We will listen to you first. Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : We are the ones to look for when we talk about SMBs. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe just on Credit Karma and now moving Mint into that segment on an official basis. Maybe we just spend a minute talking about sort of the opportunities there in a little more detail. How much can Mint drive engagement in addition to Credit Karma Money? And just over the long-term, how should we be thinking about that combination? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Daniel, thank you for your question. We kicked off a strategy project. It\u2019s been almost probably a year ago to just understand how we can accelerate making ends meet and our vision to truly have a consumer financial platform that can be the self-driving platform for consumers no matter where they are in their life, whether they are students or someone that is later in their life where they have achieved a level of financial freedom and have different sets of needs. And given the work that we did around our vision, we decided to bring Mint and Credit Karma together because in essence, although we have a lot of prime members as part of the Credit Karma base, Mint actually has a number of feature and functionality that the prime members need the most. So that\u2019s number one is bringing some of the features and functionalities together as part of the Credit Karma platform. And over time, that will actually make Credit Karma much more robust to be able to serve all kinds of members no matter what their sort of credit band is. Number two is actually leveraging the scale and the power of the algorithm, the machine learning capabilities, the decision engines that we have in Credit Karma that ultimately deliver north of 35 billion machine learning predictions per day. We can leverage a lot of those capabilities to make Mint a lot better as part of Credit Karma. So, we do expect that this will be accretive in the long-term, delivering benefits to members, and ultimately, truly of achieving our mission and our vision of unlocking smart money decisions for consumers. So, that is our approach and thinking, and we are very excited about it. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks. And then just a second one on Mailchimp, appreciate all the context you provided about the quarter and the trajectory of the business. I guess are there any learnings from the Mailchimp acquisition that you would share that maybe will impact your acquisition philosophy going forward? And just maybe a comment on sort of what the acquisition outlook and playbook is today. Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Absolutely. Let me start with the single-biggest thing that we have learned, and we are diagnosing it wouldn\u2019t have changed any of what we have done. We are very, very excited about what we are going to do in executing our vision with Mailchimp and QuickBooks coming together. But it\u2019s having diagnosed upfront some of the product conversion opportunities that we are going after. I would say that\u2019s probably the single-biggest thing that we did not diagnose as well as I would like to see us diagnose. I would also say that\u2019s a \u2013 if you are going to misdiagnose something, that\u2019s an okay one because it\u2019s within your control and you can address it. But I would say that\u2019s probably the biggest one. It has not at all altered the priorities that I mentioned a moment ago. But it is something that we have really gone back, and we are looking as to how we can put that in our playbook to do a better job diagnosing upfront. But in no way, shape or form does it change how we feel about the possibilities ahead, and it has not impacted our timeline at all. The second thing is our M&A playbook has not changed. Our Uber goal is time to market. Our principles around looking at capabilities that could help us accelerate delivering our vision are unchanged. And so I would just \u2013 I would leave it at that. Nothing new to report. It\u2019s unchanged. Daniel Jester : Great. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question and great quarter. Just wanted to dig into the payment part of the business, I guess that\u2019s one of the underappreciated asset, I would say, Intuit has. You talked about total invoices now growing $2 trillion versus last year, $1.5 trillion. Could you help us understand how you have been gaining share within that business? And also, what are the opportunity you see for Intuit payments to expand beyond QuickBooks like some of the acquired asset? If you could share some of your long-term vision on that, that would be great. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Absolutely. What\u2019s great about your question, Siti, is our Big Bet 4, which is about being the center of small business growth, is really about helping our customers grow their customer base. And it\u2019s actually about cash flow, managing their cash flow. And that\u2019s where the power of Mailchimp and QuickBooks come together. Specifically around the $2 trillion of invoices that we are now managing on our platform and your question about how do we continue to gain share, I will start with just sharing how we have accelerated our growth from the 11% several years ago to the 30% that I mentioned a moment ago from a charge volume perspective, and it\u2019s really just basic innovation. It\u2019s around discoverability. It\u2019s around innovation like instant deposit. It\u2019s around innovation like paid up-front, which really gives you the ability to send an invoice and get paid instantly because of all the data points that we see. And it\u2019s just really making the experience \u2013 auto enabling the experience for payments to always be on versus opting in. Those are illustrative examples of where we have innovated to accelerate the growth in payments. And by the way, I want to be clear, there is so much more yet to do there because \u2013 when you look at the last 5 years to 6 years, our team has spent probably the first half of those 6 years just building the basic platform capabilities to be able to innovate much faster. We have a lot of those capabilities. Now we are able to innovate and deliver faster innovation to our customers. So, that\u2019s one area where we will continue to double down to take more share. But we also have a significant opportunity to digitize all of business-to-business. A big chunk of this $2 trillion of invoices that are managed on our platform is actually business-to-business, where it\u2019s a QuickBooks customer that transacts with another QuickBooks customer. And the opportunity that we have is that at the end of the day, you can look up that small business, send them an invoice. That invoice ends up sitting \u2013 showing up in their books, and they can pay instantly right on our rails. So, that\u2019s an example of the types of things that we are working on in addition to what I have shared a moment ago to really accelerate increasing our penetration and share of this $2 trillion. And I will just end with going back to a couple of questions that I think were asked around what gives us confidence around our small business guidance. And it\u2019s really \u2013 this is one great example of helping customers get paid faster. It\u2019s already happening on our rails. We don\u2019t need to go acquire the customer. These invoices are being managed on our platform. Now the question is how do we help the customer put more money in their pocket faster, and it\u2019s sort of our right to win. And this is a great example of what gives us a lot of confidence as we look ahead. Siti Panigrahi : That\u2019s great color. And just a quick follow-up to one of your comments on Mailchimp that you are planning to grow up to meet market. Can you help us understand who are the Mailchimp\u2019s strength right now, maybe in the employee segment and where you are targeting, right, that mid-market? And is it also something \u2013 are you trying to expand your features more beyond e-mail marketing when you are trying to go into the mid-market? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Absolutely. I would liken \u2013 since you and many that are listening have followed us for years, I would liken that the Mailchimp journey that we are on, very similar to the QuickBooks journey. Specifically, there is a lot of overlap in the type of customers that we serve. Mailchimp generally has served the smaller small businesses, less than 10 employees. However, it actually has a lot of the capabilities to be able to serve the mid-market customers. And it comes down to adding some features and functionalities, basic things like how you do billing to actually ensure that you have the right inside sales force and customer success agents to be able to serve these mid-market customers. A lot of what we have built and know how to build in mid-market for our QuickBooks Advanced, but we are doing the same thing now with Mailchimp. So, it has a lot of the feature functionalities, but we are building out additional ones. But we are also building out our sales and customer success inside sales and customer success to be able to then serve those customers. And then you put that together with going to market together with QuickBooks, it really sort of brings the power of the benefits that we are able to deliver to customers and makes us far more attractive in the market for those small businesses that we want to serve. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Turrin : Hey there. Thanks and good afternoon. Appreciate taking the question. The EPS guide for the full year, it\u2019s not the highest, among the highest we have ever seen at 16% growth as a starting point from Intuit. You have had some questions, it\u2019s especially notable given the current environment. I think it\u2019s clear that increasing the target range for small business helps. But is there anything else you would point to? Are there platform advantages you are finding with some of the newer segments, or just anything else you would point us towards that\u2019s helping to unlock the bigger EPS growth algorithm? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Michael. I will just amplify what Michelle shared earlier. We have leverage that is coming from three places that we view as durable. One is on the technology side. And we are actually excited about having there kind of walk of you through our technology stack, our technology vision and how it\u2019s fueling innovation and also how it\u2019s giving us margin leverage at Investor Day. But in that context, that\u2019s one significant lever where we are continuing to build services so we can build them once and use them multiple times across the company. And it\u2019s actually one of the things that is an accelerant to fueling innovation and acquisitions like Mailchimp and Credit Karma. The second is the leverage we get from how we are building out our marketing platform so that our MarTech services can be used across all of the segments across the company. And third is the technology that we are building once and applying to all of our customer success operations, which just recall, is quite large. We have over 700 million interactions with customers. And we shifted the company years ago from every segment builds out their own operations. So, we are building it once, and the segments leverage the same operations across the company and then making sure that we ensure that those services and those platforms are used by not only across the company but our acquisitions like Credit Karma and Mailchimp. So, the leverage is coming from technology across the company, MarTech and customer success operations. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving what we delivered this past year, the guidance that you heard Michelle talk about and the durability that we believe we have looking ahead. Michael Turrin : Thank you. Just a quick follow-on, if I may. Some useful commentary around mix throughout the call. With Credit Karma, you are guiding for 10% to 15% growth. It\u2019s below the longer term targets we have seen. But clearly, there was some outside \u2013 outsized growth there over the past year. So, I am wondering if there is any way you can help disaggregate the tough comps versus some of the macro assumptions to frame that guide in relation to the longer term targets we have seen. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure Michael. It is in fact, both. One is we have a big comp 2 years of 37% and then last year, 58% growth. And we have a lot of confidence in our long-term expectations for 20% to 25%. So, that is unchanged. So yes, one element is the tough comp. But really the \u2013 I would say the other element, probably a bigger element, is the current trends that we are seeing that we have really incorporated in our guide. When you look at our verticals around credit cards, personal loans, insurance and then home loans, just \u2013 and then there is the money vertical, almost every vertical has been impacted. And by the way, you can see based on our guide, the resiliency of the platform, other than, of course, the credit card vertical that really has not seen any significant impact. So, that\u2019s the second piece that we have incorporated into our guidance is the, in fact, the macroeconomic environment that we see. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Thanks. Sasan, a number of CEOs have been calling out the shift to services-based economy from a product-based. And I believe, correct me if I am wrong, you have a heavy services base inside the small business. I am curious do you think that\u2019s helping kind of shelter the small business in this environment right now? Is that playing into some of the defensive nature of what you are seeing in the results in small business for your core? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Brent. And I think the short answer is absolutely. And there are two elements. And I will start with just a reminder that when we look at the small business market of sort of zero to 100 employees, about 70% of it is service-based businesses and about 30% is product-based businesses. And our really strength is in the service-based businesses. And I think the second thing I would just say is we are very, very diversified in the service-based businesses that we serve. We are not sort of overly anchored in one vertical or another. And that really helps with the diversification of not only our performance looking backwards, but opportunity as we look ahead. Brent Thill : And when you look at Credit Karma in past downturns, can you just give us a compare and contrast? I know you have compared the small business segment to be more SaaS. You have got virtually layered services around. Is there something different that they have done in the business to diversify? Assuming things got a little worse and not saying that\u2019s what you are saying to the guide, but if that was the case, what gives the defensive nature of that business? Sasan Goodarzi : The single largest, I would say, uniqueness about Credit Karma, aside from you got 100 million customers, incredible trough, high Net Promoter, 14-plus years of behavioral data where we know so much about these customers and know what they need, when they need it and how they need it, putting that to the side as a foundation, which is critically important, it\u2019s Lightbox. With Lightbox, it raises certainty of the experiences that \u2013 and offers that we can deliver members. But in this environment, more importantly, it is quality, which is there is a huge fight to quality by our partners. So, because we now have almost 70% of our credit card and personal loan transactions on Lightbox \u2013 and by the way, growing, that\u2019s 15 points higher than it was last year, and of course, almost non-existent years ago. And I don\u2019t even think Lightbox existed in the last recession. That is the single-biggest thing of where financial institutions have a lot of certainty when their models are part of Lightbox, so they can identify the kind of customer they want, the kind of offers that they want to provide. And of course, we make the perfect amount. So, I would say that is the single biggest thing. And it\u2019s just the scale of the platform. We are a large part of the economy providing a match between what consumers want to the financial products that they have. But I would say Lightbox. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. And I will echo the congrats. Sasan, you have alluded to this a couple of times, but I was wondering if you could just sort of dive into it in a little bit more detail. Just the power of the platform in small business and as we go into a potentially soft economic backdrop, are customers starting to talk to you all about trying to consolidate on to your platform in a bigger way now? You obviously have the ability to help them address both the back office and the front office. And while we are seeing that, I think anecdotally in payments and payroll, I was just kind of curious, given that budgets might come under more scrutiny, are you benefiting from the idea of consolidating towards one platform versus maybe taking a best-of-breed approach? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Kirk. And in fact, this is probably one of the most misunderstood or least understood element of the benefit that our platform provides. And so I will just start with stating something that I mentioned a moment ago because it really plays into your question, and that is we are not a line item on the small businesses budget. We are the platform that fuels their success. We are mission-critical. Without our platform, a small business can\u2019t run their business. And so it\u2019s really important to have that frame of mind as to what\u2019s the role that we play in the lives of small businesses. The second, to go \u2013 to get to your question, is we now have the services that we didn\u2019t have 3 years ago, 5 years ago. And in fact, yes, they are having those conversations with us less from a can I save money, but more from a perspective of I don\u2019t want to deal with all of these different applications where things are sort of disparate and discrete where I can have everything on your platform. If I am using somebody else\u2019s payroll or somebody else\u2019s capital or somebody else\u2019s payments, why not just use all the services on your platform. And frankly, this is an area where our small business team is actually doubling down on looking forward, which is how do we evolve our go-to-market to actually have a conversation with our customers about all the services that they don\u2019t use that they should use where there will be far more efficient, effective and potentially even save some money because we see all their transactions. We can see what they do if they don\u2019t do it on our platform because they have connected their bank accounts and so on. So, we believe this is an opportunity as we look ahead. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have today for questions. And I would like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Sasan Goodarzi : Awesome. Well, thank you for the wonderful questions. And we are really looking forward to seeing, hopefully, all of you, at our Investor Day at September 29th. We will, number one, walk through probably the next level of depth around the experiences that we are delivering and why in this environment they matter the most to our customers across all of our five Big Bets. And you will have a great opportunity to not only ask more questions, but connect with my wonderful team that leads a lot of this great work. So, look forward to seeing you then. Until then, be good, stay safe, and we will talk to you all soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your time today and this concludes our conference. We appreciate your participation and you may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Regina. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's first quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a strong first quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We continue to feel bullish about our momentum and execution across small business and tax. We're innovating at a high velocity using the power of our platform and modern technology capabilities to deliver new offerings at scale focusing on breakthrough adoption. We continue to be focused on putting more money in our customers' pockets, saving them time and ensuring complete confidence in every financial decision they make. This is more important than ever in the current uncertain economic environment and helps us penetrate our large total addressable market of over $300 billion. Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Revenue grew 29%, including 13 points from the addition of Mailchimp. Total revenue growth was fueled by the Small Business & Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 38% or 19% excluding Mailchimp and 25% revenue growth in the Consumer Group driven by a strong October peak with new customers and extension filers. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see charge volume growth, the number of employees paid, the hours worked per small business and cash reserves. These measures remain strong for those on our platform and inform our perspective on the health of small businesses. TurboTax had a robust finish to the tax season with a record number of innovations launched and tested in the October peak. I'm excited about this upcoming season, particularly our strategy to transform the assisted category, including the launch of Business Tax and TurboTax and Credit Karma platform integrations. Now turning to Credit Karma. At Investor Day and on our fourth quarter call earnings call, we shared that all Credit Karma verticals had been negatively impacted by the macro uncertainty. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into November, we saw further deterioration in all verticals. Consumer default rates remain relatively low by historical standards, reflecting strong consumer cash balances coming out of the pandemic. However, we continue to see partners pull back from extending credit, reflecting the uncertainty in the economic environment and the risk of deterioration in credit performance. Given this context, Credit Karma revenue came in lower than expected for the quarter. We are lowering our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance for Credit Karma to a decline of 15% to 10% versus our previous guidance of 10% to 15% growth. At the same time, we are reiterating our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance for all other segments and reiterating our fiscal 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance. Our ability to maintain earnings power despite the lower Credit Karma revenue guidance shows the power of our diversified platform and our ability to balance platform and product investments for the future while delivering on our commitments. Regardless of the near-term macro volatility, we remain confident in our long-term revenue growth expectations of 20% to 25% for Credit Karma driven by our vision and innovation to become the self-driving financial platform fueling prosperity for all consumers. At Investor Day, we shared how our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating our innovation and how our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate our success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, our 5 Big Bets are : revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across three of these Big Bets. Our first Big Bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. Our platform enables us to innovate for our customers with speed and at scale, which is foundational to all of our Big Bets. Our evolution from a siloed technology stack to a platform leveraging shared capabilities is well underway. Our development environment enables speed and innovation. Engineers now have 6x the velocity of deploying code, resulting in accelerated innovation compared to fiscal year 2020. Our AI and fintech capabilities are well positioned to solve our customers' biggest problems, such as our money innovations across payments and payroll, advancements in TurboTax Live, QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advance, just to name a few. And we're doing that today with over 730 million AI-driven customer interactions per year, 2 million AI models in production, 58 billion machine learning predictions per day and over $465 billion in money moved during fiscal year 2022. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customer face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually. During the October tax peak, our team launched a record 50 innovations to test and learn. Our learnings can help us transform our go-to-market campaign for the assisted segment; revamp the end-to-end TurboTax Live platform experiences with faster access to money via Credit Karma; and better serve the investor, Latino and self-employed segments. We are looking forward to the upcoming tax season. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. With Mailchimp, we're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp : first, delivering our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This quarter, we launched a new brand campaign, refreshed our website and launched an improved first-time use experience for new customers that help them more quickly find and use the feature that aligns with their unique business needs. We also launched a one-hour assisted onboarding process for our high-value Mailchimp customers with the goal of guiding them to more advanced features to increase awareness and usage. This program was launched in a record four weeks by leveraging components of our virtual expert platform, another example of the power of the Intuit platform capabilities. As a result of these enhancements and others, we're seeing a positive impact on customer growth and expansion and a lift in customers converting to pay. Turning to our money portfolio. We've made a tremendous investment over the last few years to expand our suite of money offerings to help small businesses get paid, pay others and access capital and manage their money. We continue to see strength in our charge volume driven by easier discovery, auto-enable payments, instant deposit and getting paid upfront. This quarter, we made it even easier for more customers to access their cash quickly by removing friction and opening the funnel to more customers. We're also rolling out a new invoicing experience with a more streamlined workflow and improved design, which is driving an increase in the percentage of companies that send payment-enabled invoices. Looking ahead, we're tackling another big challenge for our small business customers, B2B payments. More than $2 trillion of invoices were managed in QuickBooks in fiscal year 2022. As we shared at Investor Day, we are launching the QuickBooks Business Network, which connects small business customers each other, making it easier for them to do business. It's currently in beta testing, and we expect to launch more broadly later this fiscal year. We're also building our own bill pay functionality in QuickBooks and plan to launch this capability in the future. We're excited about our opportunities for growth with Mailchimp and payments becoming the center of small business growth. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our long-term business strategy and the power of our platform. In an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and more mission-critical than ever for our customers. We have a large TAM with low penetration, secular shifts working in our favor, a diversified large-scale platform where we continue to invest heavily in innovation across our 5 Big Bets to deliver benefits for our customers, resulting in top line growth and margin expansion. We're proud to be an employer of choice as well as the financial technology platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper. Now let me hand it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, GAAP operating income of $76 million versus $195 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $662 million versus $555 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.14 versus $0.82 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.66 versus $1.53 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business & Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 38% during the quarter and 19% on an organic basis, excluding $264 million in Mailchimp revenue. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 60% in Q1 or 28% excluding Mailchimp. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business & Self-Employed Group is threefold : grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 29% in Q1 driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking, grew 109% in Q1. Excluding Mailchimp, online services revenue grew 28%. Mailchimp revenue included in online services was $264 million, up low teens versus a year ago, in line with our expectations. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, and we began to execute our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 172% in Q1 and 19% on an organic basis excluding Mailchimp. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 7% in the first quarter. As a reminder, the subscription model for our desktop accounting solution makes this revenue more predictable, and we raised our desktop prices for several products in September to more closely align with QBO pricing. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits during the quarter. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be our growth catalyst going forward. Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue grew 2% to $425 million in Q1. This was below our expectations of mid-single-digit growth we shared at Investor Day due to further deterioration in all verticals the last few weeks of the quarter. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by credit cards, offset by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans. As the macro environment continues to remain uncertain, we're seeing an impact across all verticals. Sasan touched on this briefly earlier, but let me unpack what we're seeing. In credit cards, many financial institution partners have tightened eligibility, particularly in riskier segments. In personal loans, we saw continued pressure with many partners tightening eligibility further while increasing APRs. We continue to expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after very strong growth in fiscal 2022. As a result, we are reducing our fiscal 2023 Credit Karma revenue guidance to a decline of 15% to 10%. This embeds the current trends we're seeing and additional conservatism in the remainder of the year despite the expected continued rollout of several new innovations. Consumer Group revenue was $150 million, reflecting a strong finish to the tax season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted category in the tax prep market as we head into the next tax season. We're focused on making TurboTax a compelling destination for filers who prefer assistance to complete their taxes accurately and quickly. Turning to the ProTax Group. Revenue of $34 million was in line with our expectations. Our financial principles guide our decisions remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $7 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $519 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable January 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I shared last quarter, we have an operating system we use to run the Company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. As Sasan shared earlier, we are reiterating our operating income and earnings per share expectations for fiscal year 2023 despite our lower revenue expectations for Credit Karma. We're able to do this by reducing spend in areas where we expect to see lower returns near term. Last quarter, I mentioned we identified several levers we can pull to deliver against our financial principles in a variety of scenarios, and the adjustments we have made are an example. Given the breadth of our offerings and the power of our diversified platform, we have the ability to maintain earnings power despite our expectation for lower Credit Karma revenue. At the same time, we have the ability to make the necessary platform and product investments for the future while delivering on our short- and long-term commitments. We also have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offense. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. For fiscal 2023, we are lowering our revenue guidance for Credit Karma as trends in all verticals further deteriorated in the last few weeks of the quarter and into November. We now expect revenue to decline 15% to 10% versus our previous guidance range of 10% to 15% revenue growth. We are reiterating our revenue expectations for all other segments and now expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 12% versus the previous range of 14% to 16%. For the Small Business & Self-Employed Group, we continue to expect 19% to 20% revenue growth. And for the Consumer Group, we continue to expect 9% to 10% revenue growth. In both businesses, we expect the majority of our growth this year to come from customer growth and mix. We are reiterating our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2023. This demonstrates the resiliency of our diversified platform and business model. So to recap, for fiscal year 2023, we expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 9% to 13%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 17% to 19%, GAAP diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 5% to 1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP loss per share of $0.29 to $0.23, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 to $1.45. You can also find our full fiscal 2023 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Michelle. As you all heard from Michelle and I, we're seeing continued momentum as a result of our strategy of being a global AI-driven expert platform, growing Intuit double digits with margin expansion. With our accelerated organic innovation and the addition of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities. And with that, let me turn it over to your questions. Operator : Our first question will come from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Siti Panigrahi : Sasan, you lowered your Credit Karma growth now from 10% to 15% growth to decline now 15% to 10%. Just want to dig a little bit into your assumption for the remaining quarters in this fiscal year. Where do you see -- how conservative is this guidance? And I know that the Karma guarantee will be rolled out sometime later this year. Where can we see some kind of upside surprise if macro stays at the current level? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thanks for your question, Siti. So a couple of things. One, as you heard from Michelle, we took the current sort of trends that we were seeing in sort of end of October into November into account. But we also very intentionally included further conservatism, deterioration just to be prudent. And so when we look at things around delinquency rates and unemployment, which is really what financial institutions look at to make future decisions, although they are at historical lows, the assumption is that they're going to deteriorate. And so we just assumed that they will significantly deteriorate, and we wanted to include that in our go-forward guidance. We take a lot of pride in the commitments that we make at the Company level, and we want to make sure that we're very prudent in terms of the assumptions that we made with the guidance going forward. With that said, I think what I would amplify is our innovation that we talked about at Investor Day. Beyond things like Karma Guarantee, we are actually -- we have launched, it's almost at full scale, something called the Marketplace, where we're giving more exposure to personalize experiences around cards and personal loans to our members. And now with the integration of Mint and Credit Karma, which was part of our refreshed Big Bet three vision that we talked about at Investor Day, we expect in the future to have additional sort of capabilities and innovations for our prime customers, which has not been our sweet spot in -- on the Credit Karma platform. So we are leaning into our innovation and those possibilities. We are not counting on any of that impacting the growth rate that you just heard from Michelle and I for the fiscal year, and we just simply believe that's the right thing to do. Siti Panigrahi : Great. And then a quick follow-up on the small business side. That's pretty impressive quarter, and it grew 19% organically. And if I look at your guidance for remaining three quarters, you just have to grow 14% to hit your guidance. You already -- like you talked about price mix shift and -- or you already raised pricing 10% to 25%. So what are you seeing in the small business side? And what are your assumptions for the remaining of the year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure. Absolutely. First of all, I would start by saying we have a lot of visibility into things around consumer spending, which is charge volume. We see the number of employees, whether they're going up and down. We see a number of hours worked. We see cash reserves. And of course, there's our metrics around acquisition, retention, payments and payroll volume and also what we see across Mailchimp. And what we're seeing across the board is a continued flight to digitization. If you use our payments capability, you get paid faster, and cash flow is more critical in this environment. If you use our payroll capabilities, you're actually able to reduce errors and pay your employees and have money moved from your bank account to their bank account same day versus two weeks in advance. With the use of innovation that you've heard from us on Mailchimp, we're actually starting to see customer growth tick up. And so those are just illustrative examples are -- we're just continuing to see based on our innovation a flight to digitization, which is the strength that you heard from us in the first quarter. And we expect that momentum to continue the rest of the year. And we remain steadfast on our guidance until we see more quarters, but it is not at all about our sentiment about small business. We actually feel very good about what we're seeing across the board in small business. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Brad Sills : Just a question on the reiterated operating income guide. You lowered top line by, it looks like, about $700 million, yet you're able to sustain your operating income guidance, which is impressive and it speaks to the flexibility in your model. Michelle, you alluded to some adjustments that were made, if you could just provide a little bit of color as to where those adjustments were made in the business? Michelle Clatterbuck : Yes. Brad... Sasan Goodarzi : Sorry, Michelle, go ahead. I was going to ask who the question was for. But Michelle, please go ahead. Michelle Clatterbuck : No worries. No worries. Thank you, Brad. Yes, it is one of the things that we feel very good about. As I talked about on a previous call, when we were going through our planning for this year, we were really looking at making sure we had identified areas that we could take action on, the levers we could pull if we did see the macro environment get worse. Those things look like marketing expenses, things that we just don't think are going to pay off in the near term; other areas like travel, discretionary spend. But we are protecting R&D and our innovation. And we are continuing to invest. Our investments and our head count continue to go up across the Company. And yes, Credit Karma, we have taken the revenue down with a revenue hit there. But when we look at really being able to manage our expenses, it is looking across the Company holistically and really focusing on the areas where we think we're not going to see as much return in the short term so that we can continue to focus longer term and drive the innovation. Brad Sills : Excellent. And this -- Sasan, one for you, if I may, please. Last year, we saw a little bit of moderation in TurboTax ASP growth. You talked a little bit about that at the Analyst Day. I think it was 4% on paid ARPU versus, I think, 8% in prior years. If you could elaborate a bit on what went on there. And should we see some acceleration here? Now that you're getting into more experience with TT Live and full service, might we actually see some acceleration in TurboTax ARPU? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Absolutely. I think the way to think about it is in the long term and from a trajectory perspective, we should see ARPU go up. And now every year, strategically, we make decisions in terms of where we may expand our free offering or where we may increase price based on the leverage that we see in the marketplace, which is primarily in our assisted offerings. And those were some of the adjustments that we made last year. And as we look into this year, we actually feel very good about our do-it-yourself platform lineup. And really, our biggest leverage is going to come from accelerating what we're seeing across the TurboTax Live platform, which is really where the growth is coming from. It's really where the ARPU comes from, and it's where our biggest opportunity is with a $20 billion TAM in front of us. And of course, overtime, opening up an additional $10 billion TAM with business taxes. So that was really the intent and the logic behind why ARPU was probably a little bit slower growth last year versus prior years. And I think the way to think about it is we're going to continue to see ARPU growth into the future, and a lot of it will come from the assisted segment. And that's really part of our plan that we're executing against this coming year. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Can you guys hear me? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Perfect. Brad Zelnick : Great. Sasan, you guys are always very transparent, great disclosure. And my question is maybe a little bit bigger picture. Can you talk about the opportunity to open up and externalize into its platform services to third parties for developing their own apps with live expert functionality, rich data services, money movement perhaps, and the things that are making you so successful? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Absolutely. Great question. This was actually at Investor Day one of our, what we call Horizon 3 ideas that we have invested in, which is around externalizing services. So first and foremost, we do see a big problem space out there where developers and partners and firms look to access and have a need for things like around our virtual expert platform services to connect people to experts or had to use for our identity services and have a use for our fraud and risk capabilities. So there's a lot of services that we have across our platform that you heard Mariana talk about of which there is a need for those services externally. Now we want to be very choiceful and intentional what we choose to externalize and what we choose not to externalize and what problems we choose to solve and which ones we intentionally choose not to solve. But we do believe it as an opportunity, it's actually something that we funded about a little bit over 15 months ago, and we have a mission-based team that is working on it. And when we have more to share in terms of launches and anything that we think over time will be material for all of you to be aware, we'll be the first to share with you. But we do see it as an exciting Horizon 3 idea that's been funded and are excited about the prospects of it. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : I wanted to ask on Mailchimp. So last quarter, you pointed out that you were kind of working on go-to-market a little bit. You wanted to adjust that. This sound -- this quarter, you sounded better, and it looks like you're using Mailchimp like the lead to go -- to attack the international markets more broadly. Can you speak a little bit about what you do there, the progress that you're making, where you are in that journey, please? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Absolutely. First of all, I'll just state that I'm really excited about Rania that we just put into the business and the leadership team that she is building in. It is the result of that leadership team where we are seeing accelerated innovation. And as I mentioned a moment ago, there's been a lot of innovation just in the last sort of three to four months in Mailchimp from an entirely new brand campaign where we communicate the benefit to how you can grow your business to SMBs, both on air and on -- through digital assets. We've redesigned our website. So when you come to us, you're very clear about the benefits that we offer, the choices that you have and why it can help fuel the success of your business to then revamping the first-time use experience, along with what we have just implemented for, I would say, higher-value, larger Mailchimp customers and new customers that we want to pursue, which is a one-hour assisted onboarding to help you get on to the platform to help you understand the benefits of the platform. And in context of what we've shared around international and Mailchimp as sort of the lead internationally, we are right now focused on localizing the language. Where we have localized language versus not, we have more than 13 points conversion variants. And so of course, localized language is one of our largest levers internationally along with having a playbook that we're putting in place around go-to-market to raise awareness. So a lot of those things we have already launched that I mentioned and the localizing languages we're working on as we speak. And a lot of what we -- what I just shared, we're starting to see a real impact from customer uptick, expansion revenue. And we're excited about the possibilities and the momentum that the leadership team is building. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne : Congrats on a good quarter. Sasan, you all are in a somewhat unique position that you get to see demand -- sort of demand on both the front-office side as well as sort of the back-office side of Mailchimp and then QuickBooks. I was wondering if you could give us any when you look at the demand indicators from a front-office perspective or a back-office perspective. Are they similar? Are they different? Is there anything you've noticed now that you got to have some insight into sort of that other part of the -- of essentially the operating ecosystem of your customers? Obviously, there's just a lot of discussion in the market right now between front-office and back-office demand. So I was wondering if you can enlighten us, I guess, with any of your thoughts on that. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Kirk. And let me try to be descriptive about it, so I'm not overly generic. I think our customers that we serve, the small businesses between zero to 100 employees don't as much think about back office, front office. They just really look to have a platform to be able to grow their business and to be able to manage their cash flow. So if you think about our QuickBooks platform, let me start there, and I'll get to a jump in a moment. Really, QuickBooks helps you manage your cash flow, all your money coming in and money going out. And the notion of digitization is really important for customers, which is why we're enjoying the growth that we just shared. And that really comes down to customers can use QuickBooks to be organized. They can get paid much faster with using our payments capabilities. They can get access to capital. They can have instant money flow from their bank to their employees' banks by using our payroll. If they're out in the field, they can use our time tracking so everything is automated. All those things are about digitization. And the way small businesses think about it is it actually helps them with their cash flow because we also -- with all those capabilities, project your cash flow. So that's the real big value sort of QuickBooks. And then you add to that Mailchimp. The real value of Mailchimp is don't think about it as these are not enterprise customers. These are smaller, small businesses that where their sort of lifeline comes from being able to reach out and manage their existing customers but also effectively be able to grow their customer base. And so the reason we're continuing to see an uptick based on our innovation and based on just good execution. And I think the best is yet ahead of us in Mailchimp is that is separate and distinct from do I spend more money on advertising dollars. When you use Mailchimp, you have the ability to use our tools with a subscription that you pay on a monthly basis to be able to in an automated way, reach out to your customers, market to new customers. And we're seeing sort of equal demand -- if I go back to your frame of front office versus back office, I think where there is slower spend and declining is spending money on advertising dollars. That is not what -- Mailchimp is not impacted by advertising dollars. It's actually a -- it's a platform that you use to be able to manage your customers even if you choose to spend less advertising dollars. You can still use Mailchimp very effectively to be able to manage your customers. So that's why the demand is strong with Mailchimp and QuickBooks, and that's really what we see across the platform. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Next quarter in Q1. The question that we're all going to get tomorrow from investors is the outlook derisked. So I wanted to dig into kind of like your guys thought process. When you're talking about Credit Karma, you told us that -- you looked at sort of the trends that happened in -- at the end of the quarter in the last couple of weeks, and you assume that those trends deteriorate a little bit further on a go-forward basis to get a conservative Credit Karma guide. Can you talk to us about -- like you didn't change any of the other numbers? All the other sort of business lines are kind of intact with your prior expectations. But is there any similar kind of derisking them? Like are you assuming any degradation in the underlying business for QBO or Mailchimp or like any of the other businesses in a similar way you are Credit Karma? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Keith, thank you for your question. And I just want to acknowledge that you and others were pushing us on our Credit Karma side at Investor Day. And let me just start at the top level to share sort of what we've learned and what we've adjusted, and then I'll answer your question. When we look across tax, which is 35% of the Company; and then when you look at across small business, which is over 50% of the Company, so that's like 86% of the Company, we have sort of -- which includes Mailchimp, we have proven and tried KPIs that allows us to see things well into sort of the future not only to ensure that we're investing in all the right things, but also be able to be very intentional and thoughtful about how we guide because we take our guidance very seriously. One of the things that we learned with Credit Karma is there are two factors that we look at but we did not take into account : one is unemployment, the other is delinquency rates. And what I mean by that, not taking it into account as we view it, we look at it, and they're at historical lows. And the one thing that we learned from this process, what we are adjusting and have adjusted our KPIs is just looking at where they are today, but also projecting where they could be a year from now and ultimately projecting what could happen if we were sitting in the shoes of some of the partners that are on our platform. So that is a very important shift, which actually gets at the point you made around our Credit Karma guidance. We feel that it is absolutely derisked. We -- as you heard from Michelle and I, we have built a deterioration and conservatism in the back half of the year because we have taken into account uptick in both unemployment and delinquency rates, and therefore, have put out a guidance that we believe is the risk. To go to the second part of your question, tax, which is 35% of the Company, that is really economically resilient. So let me focus my answer on Small Business. Because of our KPIs and the rich data that we have access to and what we see within Small Business, we actually feel like our guidance in Small Business is derisked because we make certain assumptions around how things will potentially play out the remainder of the year that we took into account when we set the initial guidance, and we still feel very good about the guidance. And you can see based on what we delivered in Q1, we can just do the math and see what it means for the rest of the year. So we feel very good about the way we set guidance in those two businesses. We feel very good about the guidance in those areas for the rest of the year. And hopefully, my explanation made sense around Credit Karma. Keith Weiss : Got it. Yes, that's super helpful. And then just one clarification question. On Mailchimp, it looks like the revenues was basically flat, maybe down a little bit sequentially. I'm assuming there is a currency impact in there. Can you -- is there like a constant currency number that we could see kind of like how it sequentially? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. It's actually -- it is in constant currency. I mean maybe, Michele, I'll let you chime in here in a moment. But I think what I would say is we -- when you look at our innovation and when you look at our customer uptick and the expansion revenue that we're starting to see, it's actually very much in line with what we would have expected because a lot of our innovation that is in place is actually now accelerating the growth of the business. Because remember, this business was run for cash flow and profitability, and now we're running it for growth. And we're actually quite pleased with the impact that we're starting to see, and we would expect that to accelerate in the upcoming quarters. But Michelle, do you want to chime in on the currency version? Michelle Clatterbuck : Yes. The only thing I would clarify is that Mailchimp actually sold at U.S. dollars, and so there isn't a currency impact there for the international, even though 50% of their sales are outside the U.S. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan : Congrats on the results. Sasan and Michelle, curious to get your perspective, we don't like recessions, but this is a recession, maybe it's a recession that we've all been anticipating. It's most widely anticipated one. So what are the assumptions that you have incorporated in your soon you're forecasting for the foreseeable future? I mean, is it an uptick in attrition or maybe the expansion rates come down a little bit? I'm just curious to get your thoughts on what you've dialed in with your current go around of trajections. And also, Sasan, if you could talk about payments. You clearly demoed at the analyst event, very, very impressive. Clearly, it's got a lot of potential. What should we be expecting? What are you expecting in your payments business in the medium term to long term? What are your goals? Congrats. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thanks for the question, Kash. Just in terms of your question around assumptions, I think on Credit Karma, hopefully, what I just shared a moment ago resonated in that. We are assuming sort of further deterioration and conservatism in the back half of the year or the remainder of the year, I should say. Despite a lot of innovation that is still coming to market because we're just -- we're making assumptions around unemployment going up, delinquency rates getting worse, which means that financial institutions, although we're one of the last platforms they pull off of that they will be conservative in terms of their investment levels. So those are the assumptions that we've made for the remainder of the fiscal year for Credit Karma. And for Small Business, a lot of the strength that we're continuing to see is just -- it's a shift to digitization from folks that are already on our platform. So we have a lot of customers that are on our platform. If you remember, we used the figure of -- there's $2 trillion of invoices being managed on our platform, and we have over $100 million that is part of our -- well over $100 million as part of our payments charge volume, which means we have a huge opportunity to penetrate that within our existing base. And I use that just as an illustrative example, Kash. To answer your question, we're not making any assumptions around payments uptick because the macro environment will get better in the second half of the year. We're actually assuming that a lot of the growth that we are seeing is just continuing shift to digitization from those that are on our platform. And so we make customer acquisition assumptions. We make attrition assumptions. We'll look at assumptions around payments and payroll that are really in context of how we feel about the environment going forward. Although we're not seeing it within our SMB segment, we are assuming a level of conservatism as we think about the remainder of the year. And those are the assumptions that we've made for both Small Business and Credit Karma. And tax, again, tax is economically resilient. We pretty much make assumptions based on our penetration in the assisted segment. And that's really -- that and the total number of IRS returns is where our assumptions come from. And again, those are -- that's economically resilient. So that's how we think about the guide going forward as we just reiterated. In terms of payments, listen, payments is one of the areas that we're the most excited about. If I had to pick a couple of areas, it's Mailchimp, it's payments and it's what we're doing to go upmarket and with QuickBooks Advanced and mid-market. And with payments, we spent four or five years building out all of our fraud and risk capabilities, all of our AI capabilities, and we're just innovating very fast with that team. And a lot of the future around what we can do to digitize B2B around what's possible with bill pay, that -- those are yet to come and not even in our forecast going forward because we just believe that there's so much room for penetration attached going forward. So hopefully, our say and payments has been to your liking, but we think our best is yet ahead of us. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger : Sasan, I'm curious, I'm kind of honing in on Credit Karma and credit cards, which I believe is about half of the revenue. And please correct me if that's changed, perhaps gone up, based on what personal loans has done. But just how are you looking at credit cards? What are you seeing with consumers there? I understand it was the strength in that segment of the quarter versus personal loans, home loans, auto loans, auto insurance. What -- specifically in the credit cards, is that strengthening -- or maybe not strengthening, but weakening a lot less? Just honing in on that specific segment, what are you seeing from the consumer? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Scott. First of all, it is -- as you said, it's a large part of the overall Credit Karma platform. With that said, I'll start with context that when you look at the 129 million customers or members that we serve on Credit Karma, the majority of our focus has been sub-prime and near-prime customers. And that's really a lot of our personalized experiences are for those cohorts. And one of the things that we're very excited about that we have shared at Investor Day is we're also building out capabilities and innovation for prime customers. And that's why we shifted Mint over, and we're combining the Mint and Credit Karma platform. So that context is important because as you hear my answer, just hear it from the lens of the majority of where our business comes from is sub-prime and near-prime. In the future, we'll also have capabilities, innovation and ultimately, revenue that will come up front and prime as well, which positions us really well in the marketplace. And with all of that said, in essence, yes, we're continuing to see growth in credit cards, but we're actually assuming that, that will really deteriorate the rest of the year based on unemployment going up and delinquency rates going up. And as you heard from both Michelle and I, we have built conservatism into the remainder of the year. And so there's -- which will ultimately result in declining growth rate. But what we saw in Q1 and the growth rate of the 2%, a lot of the headwinds in other verticals was offset by credit cards. But we have assumed that, that will get worse over time. Scott Schneeberger : Okay. Appreciate that. And then following on -- it's kind of more on the tax side, but overall, the guidance for the second quarter seems to be the most derisked with EPS down year-over-year. And that's an uncommon sequential change. But it sounds like the levers Michelle is pulling, it sounded like marketing and advertising was one of them. I infer that it's more in the small business side. But just curious on the tax side, are you doing anything differently now that we may have a more normal tax season versus the past few with regard to advertising timing or overall? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure. I'm actually glad you asked about our second quarter guide of 8% to 9%. First of all, our momentum in Small Business continues into Q2. There are two elements that drive our guide of 8% to 9% revenue growth in second quarter. One is we always make assumptions for tax. As you know, tax is tricky between second quarter and third quarter. And we make assumptions around when the IRS will open, forms availability, and those assumptions drive what we assume will happen in our tax business. And in some cases, we have elements of our tax business that actually we've assumed may decline in the second quarter. So that drives our guidance overall at the Company level for Q2. And then Q2 generally has been seasonally the weakest quarter for Credit Karma because of the month of November, December and January and then just the number of holidays. It's seasonally the weakest quarter. So when you combine our assumptions with tax and you combine our assumptions with Credit Karma, that's where you get Q2 where it is. And hopefully, that answers your question. Scott Schneeberger : It does. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Allan Verkhovski : This is Allan Verkhovski on for Alex Zukin. I think more people are warming up to your ability in hitting your SMB guide for the year despite the challenging macro. But I want to dig further into what you're seeing in the SMB segment today. Can you talk about what you saw around ARPC growth in the quarter, excluding the benefit you observed from the pricing increases that went into effect? It'd be helpful to get how much of a tailwind the pricing increase was in the quarter for QBO accounting and better understand the quarter how your growth levers, such as customer growth, upselling and cross-selling, were impacted from the macro, if at all? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure. Absolutely. The majority of our guide for the year and what we also saw in Q1 actually came from customer growth and mix, and mix includes things like QuickBooks Advanced. And you saw from our online services growth of 28%, we're seeing really sort of good growth from Payroll, Payments, Time Tracking. And that, of course, excludes Mailchimp, and we talk about Mailchimp separately. So I think the short answer to your question is we are seeing the type of balance that we would want, which is our growth coming from customer growth and mix and price will play an element -- a smaller element, but it plays an important element as we look at not only what we saw in Q1, but what we expect for the remainder of the year. Allan Verkhovski : Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, if I may. On the Mailchimp front, I want to follow up to Keith's earlier point around Mailchimp revenues being sequentially relatively flat. Could you share maybe something more about maybe conversion rates? Or just a follow-up on the acceleration comment you made through the full year, just anything that could give us more color for how we think about potential revenue growth of Mailchimp for the full year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Yes. Absolutely. I mean if you go back to when we closed the deal almost a year ago, one of the things that we were very clear about, in addition to our excitement around the asset and the fact that now combined with QuickBooks, we can have one growth platform that can be the source of truth for -- and the source of growth for a small business, one of the things that we reiterated was that this was really a business that was run for profitability and it was run for cash flow. And even particularly in COVID times, where you saw a lot of front-office company accelerates, Mailchimp really didn't because, again, it was more run for cash flow and profitability. And so we worked very hard in the last year to put a playbook in place in context of the priorities that we've shared to accelerate growth. And those priorities, they always take time to shift the business from being run for profitability and cash flow to be run for a growth business typically takes a couple of years. And we're actually starting to see a trajectory change within the first year. And we're quite demanding of ourselves in terms of the velocity that we would like to see. So really, what's happened there last year is we were taking a business that was, again, run for profitability, cash flow to revamping the website coming up with a new campaign, revamping the product. And when I say revamp, it's not done. We've not reached the destination. It's just the beginning of what's possible to really focus on high-value customers to position ourselves to go after mid-market to start ramping up what we can do internationally. All of these things, we're starting to now see indicators where in the quarter, although it was sequentially flat from a revenue perspective, we're seeing conversion from free to pay is up. We're seeing customer growth tick up. We're actually seeing expansion revenue, which means our customers are growing and they're upgrading what SKU they use. We're starting to see these, and these things really become future indicators of growth. And that's why the comment that I made earlier and Michelle made earlier around, we expect that the growth in Mailchimp to accelerate in the coming quarters because we're seeing the KPIs around customer growth, expansion retention, these things are starting to improve. So hopefully, that helps to answer your question. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Steve Enders with Citi. Please go ahead. Steve Enders : I guess I just want to clarify a little bit on what you're seeing on the Credit Karma side and what you talked about historically on that front and what you're expecting for the guide here. I think before, you talk about expecting an acceleration kind of in the back half of the year as you kind of combine the cross-sell with TurboTax here. I guess, how are you thinking about that opportunity now given kind of where the macro is and what you're assuming versus the cross-sell that could potentially come here? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. We have taken -- thank you for the question. We have taken sort of a firewall approach here. One is we're very excited about the innovations that we talked about at Investor Day. And in fact, the only thing that's changed is we've added a few more innovations that we've launched within Credit Karma. The Marketplace that I shared earlier is one of them, where -- and it's almost at full scale where our customers see an additional tablet, a marketplace of all the products that are right for them in one place that brings more visibility and brings to the forefront products that are right for a specific cohort of customers. So in terms of the integration with TurboTax, you're going to see a far more robust experience this year with Credit Karma being integrated into TurboTax and vice versa. Credit Karma Guarantee continues to be on track in terms of a rollout to customer -- to members and financial institutions. All the innovations that we talked about, plus a few more are all on track, and we're equally as excited about the impact that it will have. And very consistent with what we shared at Investor Day, what we talked about then was that these innovations were not reliant on a macro pickup. They're just -- they're going to deliver more benefits, and therefore, more monetization. Back to the word firewall, we're not counting on those innovations in our results when we think about the rest of the year. We're assuming current trends. We're assuming further conservatism for the remainder of the year. We're making assumptions around unemployment going up, delinquency rates going up. And so therefore, that's informed our guide of minus 15% to minus 10%. And that's sort of separate and distinct from the innovation that we continue to be excited and focused on and are on track for the rollout. Steve Enders : Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And I guess just to clarify again on Mailchimp. I know that last quarter you were putting some changes in place to kind of improve conversion rates and really kind of rightsize or kind of build out some of the structure of that business. Like where are those changes you're making kind of at this point? And how should we kind of think about the level that so this kind of go in there to kind of more kind of rightsize that business? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Let me answer your question. I'm not sure what you mean by rightsize where -- is this -- we are very focused on investing in male and accelerating the growth combined with the QuickBooks platform. And I would say a couple of big things that we have put in place and are continuing to implement. One is really strengthening the leadership team at all levels. We're very excited about leaders that we -- had joined the Mailchimp family and with Radia's addition to the Mailchimp team with additional changes that we are making to continue to strengthen the team, very excited about the impact there because that's having a direct impact on innovation, which is the second point I want to make. I really like the velocity, particularly what I've seen in the last 90 days. And I actually hope to see Mailchimp being one of the highest-velocity innovative teams across the Company with the team that we have in place. And I think everything that I mentioned earlier that we have launched is a result of the impact of that team. And lastly, it's about impact. And we're starting to see the key performance indicators that I mentioned earlier uptick in the right direction, which means that almost a year in, it's not been quite a year, but almost a year in, I feel very good about sort of year two because we've put a lot of foundational things in place in year one. We have a lot of work still ahead of us. But a lot of the work is about turning this into a sort of a strong growth business and fueling the success of small businesses, and I feel like we are on that trajectory given what I've seen, particularly in the last 90 to 100 days. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester : Thanks for squeezing me in. Two quick ones. A lot of talk about the macro with regards to Credit Karma. I'd love to hear about how you're overlaying that macro on QuickBooks Capital and anything you might be doing differently there as the year progresses, given the uncertainty. And then secondarily, Sasan, you talked about some of the economic indicators you track for small business. Are you seeing consistency in the U.S. and international? Or is maybe one geography stronger than the other right now? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, absolutely. Let me start with your macro question and QuickBooks Capital. We have built incredible machine learning capabilities, where we literally can control the dial of which customers' capacity for customers on a daily basis. And QuickBooks Capital is very important for our customers, and it is not a material sort of revenue driver for the Company is, however, essential as part of our overall platform. So I think that what I would say is we're very good and has been very good. I think it's been proven, especially during the COVID times, to be able to adjust the doubt so that we offer capital only to those that we can see can pay it back. And remember, the loans that we typically give could be from 30 days to six months. And there's a ceiling for all of these loans. So we feel very good about the macro environment impact and how we manage our QuickBooks Capital within that context, and I think we've proven that during COVID. The second element of your question, I would love to sort of parse it out in two ways. One is even in the U.S., there are sectors within small business. Remember, we're very diversified in the small businesses that we serve. But there are segments within small businesses that have gotten hit hard, those that focus on auto sales, those that focus on financial services, those that focus on real estate. Some of their revenues are down 10% to 15%, but you don't really see that in our results because we're very, very diversified. We're not -- no one sector can really impact our overall results. So that's in context of the globe, but it's also in context of the U.S. Not every sector is created equal. Some sectors are hit hard, the ones that I just mentioned. I would say U.S. has been the strongest followed by Canada, and the ones that have been hit the hardest has been U.K., Australia and France. And again, our -- we're not -- we've not assumed any of this in our guidance, but our hope is those will, over time, begin to bounce back. We've not seen the bounce back yet, but they've been hit harder than the U.S. Daniel Jester : Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : You're very welcome. And I think that was the last question. And so maybe I can bring us to close by saying thank you for all of your wonderful questions. And be safe, and we look forward to seeing all of you for our second quarter earnings results. Until then, be safe. Thank you, everybody. Bye-bye. Sasan Goodarzi : Goodbye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Intuit Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Abby. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's second quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As you read in our press release, we announced that Michelle will step down from the CFO role and plans to retire from Intuit. I'm pleased to share that Sandeep Aujla will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer on August 1, 2023. It is a well-crafted succession plan that will cover more in a few minutes, but let's first get started with the business. We had another strong quarter, as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform, powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Second quarter revenue grew 14%, fueled by Small Business & Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 20% and Consumer revenue growth of 26%. This year, we are celebrating Intuit's 40th anniversary. We're incredibly proud of our history of reimagining the company and reinventing ourselves, which has enabled us to thrive during various technological shifts and economic cycles. Having successfully navigated multiple platform ships over the years, including our largest transformation to artificial intelligence in the era of digitization, we continue to be confident in our ability to fuel growth, given our large TAM, low penetration, proven strategy and 5 Big Bets. We are proud to be the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities that we serve. I will first start with some thoughts about the tax season and our business in the current macro environment. As you know, the scale of our platform and rich data, gives us unique insights into the lives and spending habits of 100 million-plus customers. Our Small Business performance continues to be very strong, despite uncertainty in the broader macro environment. We continue to see strength in the areas that have the greatest impact, including the growth of our online mid-market customers, contributing to strong subscription revenue and higher ARPC. In Q2, growth in both the number of companies running online payroll and the number of employees paid on our platform remains strong. Total online payments volume grew 25%, moderating some from the first quarter. We are seeing strong growth in the number of payment-enabled invoices set by our Small Business customers, a good sign that our innovation is continuing to drive digitization. The shift to digitization and the power of our small business platform, including QuickBooks and MailChimp, resonate with customers as they grow their business and improve cash flow. We continue to observe that our AI-driven expert platform is critical to our customers' success. Now turning to tax. We're confident in our strategy to both extend our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transform the assisted category. Following a highly successful extension season last year, we doubled down on our learning's to further accelerate innovation to better serve our customers. First, we're evolving our TurboTax brand to increase awareness that we are the best alternative in the assisted tax segment for consumers and small businesses, a combined $30 billion TAM. Our new campaign, Come to TurboTax and Don't do your taxes is resonating with our customers and is the key to our strategy as we focus on attracting customers from the assisted segment. Second, we launched a number of high-impact TurboTax Live innovation. As part of our second Big Bet, we are solving one of the largest problems our customer's face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually. Building on our learning's from last season, we're continuing to use AI to bring in our customers' data and match them to the right experts to help customers get the maximum refund they deserve with confidence. To help customers finish their taxes even more quickly. We've created a new gamified experience focused on efficiency, backed by our lifetime guarantee. We evolved our full-service offering, so filers can have their return completed in a single virtual session. We are off to a great start in tax, and we continue to be confident in our game plan to win. Now shifting to our 5 Big Bets, I would like to highlight some examples of recent progress. As a reminder, our Big Bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. In addition to what I've shared about TurboTax Live, we've achieved product market fit with QuickBooks Live, which we expect could help us penetrate non-consumption and drive breakthrough adoption. We're evolving our QuickBooks Live into a portfolio of expert services and are embedding these services as part of our lineup, similar to TurboTax Live. In the second quarter, we launched a three expert-guided setup available for all new QBO customers leveraging our virtual expert platform. Early results indicate that customers using this offering have more confidence in and awareness of our full ecosystem of services, which translate into better retention and higher adoption of our service offerings. With our third Big Bet, our vision for Credit Karma is to become the comprehensive self-driving financial platform that propels our members forward, wherever they are on their financial journey. We are innovating across all verticals and continue to have confidence in our long-term growth expectations of 20% to 25% despite near-term headwinds. I'll share a few examples. We're innovating to help members get faster access to cash and make financial progress, including improving their credit score with the help of Credit Karma Money. For example, with the integration of TurboTax and Credit Karma, approved members can get money in their hands in as little as one minute after the IRS accepts their return. As this is the largest paycheck of the year for many, this enables them to take care of immediate expenses, pay down debt or build savings. Members also receive recommendations for how to achieve their financial goals, such as creating an emergency savings fund with our high-yield savings account or building credit with credit builder. Members who activate credit builders see an average score increase of 21 points in as little as 30 to 45 days. Members who use Credit Karma Money show higher engagement on the Credit Karma platform. We are driving more confidence for members with Karma Guarantee. As a reminder, Karma Guarantee offers indicate that members will either be approved or they'll receive $50. At the end of the quarter, 59% of members were eligible for at least one Karma Guarantee offer. With Mint now part of the Credit Karma platform, we're beginning to build a new experience for members with prime credit scores, which Credit Karma is underpenetrated in today. Leveraging Mint, we see the opportunity to develop personalized product recommendations, levering gene net worth, transaction and spend data to highlight the product benefits that matter most to these members. Our fourth Big Bets is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. We continue to innovate to digitize money movement from creating an estimate, to invoicing a customer, to getting paid. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit and getting paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering. And we are making meaningful progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow. We see a tremendous opportunity as 70% of B2B transactions are still completed with checks. This quarter, we launched a QuickBooks business network to millions of QuickBooks customers to further digitize B2B payments in the U S. We're also building our Bill Pay functionality in QuickBooks and plan to launch this capability in the future. Now turning to Mailchimp. We're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This quarter, we made some great progress against these priorities. To help our small businesses customers run and grow their business in one place, we launched a real-time data sync that brings QBO data such as invoices, sales receipts, items, customers and addresses into mail channel. This puts customer and purchase data together all in one place to power our customers' success. To help our customers plan, execute and track their marketing campaigns across multiple channels in one place, we launched a new capability called Campaign Manager. This reduces the number of tools needed to manage marketing and assess performance across channels. And to drive accelerated global growth and execute our refreshed international strategy, we're translating the product into multiple languages, including Spanish and Portuguese. And beyond the progress we've made on these priorities, the product lineup innovation, assisted onboarding and improved first-time use we shared last quarter, is driving green shoots in paid conversion, which was up 2 points year-over-year in the second quarter. Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, of which 700,000 are already in our franchise today. As I mentioned earlier, online mid-market customer growth remained strong, and we are seeing increased adoption of QBO Advanced, payments and payroll, driving ARPC expansion, as we serve these customers across our full ecosystem of services. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 Big Bets. And in an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and more mission-critical than ever to our customers. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $3 billion; GAAP operating income of $270 million versus $56 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $856 million versus $612 million last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.60 versus $0.35 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.20 versus $1.55 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business & Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 20% during the quarter, and online ecosystem revenue grew 24%. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business & Self-Employed group is threefold : grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 27% in Q2, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes payroll, Mailchimp, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 21% in Q2. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Mailchimp revenue growth in the quarter was up low teens. Growth was driven by higher effective prices, aligning with our pricing for value philosophy and improving conversion. We will continue to provide regular updates on the business, so you can track our performance over time, including a deeper dive at Investor Day, similar to what we do for the rest of the business. Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth, as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 17% in Q2. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 10% in the second quarter. The subscription model for our desktop accounting solution makes this revenue more predictable. And we raised our desktop prices for several products in September, to more closely align with pricing for value. We're about halfway through the three-year transition to a subscription model for Desktop. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew high teens during the quarter. We expect continued strong Desktop Ecosystem revenue growth, as we progress through the back half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be our growth catalyst going forward. We remain confident in our guidance for total Small Business and Self-Employed group of 19% to 20% revenue growth this year. Consumer Group revenue of $516 million grew 26% in Q2, reflecting a faster forming season this year. We remain confident in our guidance for Consumer Group of 9% to 10% revenue growth for fiscal 2023. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue grew 7% in Q2, in line with our expectations. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $375 million in Q2, down 16%. This was slightly ahead of our expectations in its seasonally smaller quarter. As a reminder, Credit Karma represented 14% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022. On a product basis, the decline was driven primarily by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma Money. We continue to see an impact across all verticals in this uncertain macro environment. In credit cards, we continue to see partners tighten eligibility in riskier cohorts. In personal loans, we continue to see pressure as partner's further tightened eligibility, and we expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after a very strong growth in fiscal 2022. We remain confident in our guidance of a decline of 15% to 10% in fiscal 2023. Our financial principles guide our decisions, remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $7.1 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $500 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable April 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I shared consistently in the past several quarters, we have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results, while investing in what is most important for future growth. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. We also have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offsets. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2023 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 9% to 13% and non-GAAP operating income growth of 17% to 19%. GAAP diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 5% to 1% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.82 to $6.89 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.42 to $8.49. You can also find, our full fiscal 2023 and Q3 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. On a personal note, as we announced today, I will be stepping down as CFO on July 31 and made it a priority over the last several years to focus on our long-term strategy for driving growth, and that includes ensuring I have a high-performing finance team with strong succession plans in place. Sandeep has been an integral part of the finance leadership team for over seven years, and I have no doubt he will be a terrific leader and CFO. He has shown his ability to drive key strategic priorities to create value for our business, time and time again, and I look forward to working with him over the next five months to ensure upcoming transition. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Michelle. Well, while the CFO transition isn't official until August, I wanted to just take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for all that Michelle has contributed over the past 20 years at Intuit including the last five years as CFO. She has been an amazing partner and will leave Intuit better than what she founded. And during Michelle's tenure as CFO, Intuit's market cap and revenue more than doubled. Michelle's commitment to developing top and diverse talent has created a deep bench of strong leaders, making firm a very seamless transition. Sandeep will be an exceptional CFO and with his track record of leading outstanding performance across our Small Business and Self-Employed Group and our technology organizations. So with that, let me go ahead and summarize. We are seeing continued momentum as we execute on our strategy of being a global AI-driven expert platform and growing Intuit revenue double-digits with margin expansion. With our accelerated organic innovation, and the additional -- the additions of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities. We're proud that Intuit has been named number five, on Fortune's Most Admired Company in the software category, one of Glassdoor's 2023 Best Places to Work and honored to be including -- included among Just Capital's Just 100 ranking for 2023. With that, let's now open it up to your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Chirag Ved : This is Chirag Ved, dialing in for Kirk. I really appreciate you taking the question and congratulations on a strong quarter. I wanted to ask about what you're seeing in QuickBooks online growth, both from new customers and from upselling existing customers. Just any commentary you might be able to provide around the dynamics there? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. I would lead with -- we're seeing strength both in terms of customer acquisition, retention, we are seeing strength in our services. As we mentioned a moment ago, both the number of companies that are running payroll, the number of employees that are getting paid is very strong. We're -- if you compare our results to what you're seeing in the marketplace, we are continuing to grow payments 25%, total payments charge volume, which is really outstanding because of the fact that our customers are continuing to benefit from digitizing on our platform. And I think just the additive piece is we're seeing strength in mid-market, which is much higher ARPC and we're quite excited about really being able to pursue non-consumption with what we talked about earlier with QuickBooks Live actually being embedded as part of our overall offering. And I would just end with one of the goals that we talked about with all of you four years ago, our bold 2025 goals. One of those goals was that, we wanted the success rate of small businesses on our platform to be 10 points better than industry. And in fact, the small businesses on our platform, their performance is north of 15 points better than anyone in the industry. And what that just suggests is that, the small businesses on our platform are more successful, they're digitizing and they're leveraging this opportunity to continue to accelerate to deliver for their customers. Chirag Ved : All right. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. And Sasan, it's a great quarter. I think what's impressive is your small business growth in this macro environment, like when some of your peers are talking about, like push out digital transformation in small business, some weakness. So I just wanted to ask, what you were seeing in terms of like for the next few quarters, like you look at a lot of data. What kind of -- what sort of health you are seeing in the SMB economy right now? And it looks like your second half is pretty easy comp right now. So would love to hear your comments on small business. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, for sure, Siti. Thank you so much for your question. And it's actually a really important question in terms of what we've often talked about, which is, it's important that you all look at Intuit as really the authority when it comes to what's happening in the small business space. And the reason is that, our platform is mission-critical for small businesses. Our platform with QuickBooks, Mailchimp and all the services that we have on our platform, is really used by small businesses to be able to grow customers, manage their customers, manage their cash flow, be able to manage their employees end-to-end. And therefore, what that means is, it fuels our success, supported by the stat I shared a moment ago, where small businesses that are on our platform are actually 15-plus points more successful than those that are not on our platform. And so, I set that very important context, and I'll just point to payments total charge volume as an example. When you look at our performance being at 25%, that is, by far, the best in the industry. And that is because, it is all about digitization. And it's not just about payments, but it's about all the services that our small businesses use on our platform. And we expect our small businesses to continue to be successful, even in this macro environment, and we are here to support them. I will just end by saying the following, which I think you were hinting at this in your question. The strength of our businesses, as Michelle and I described a moment ago, and we expect that strength to continue, although, when you look at our guidance, I think the way you should look at our guidance is that it has been de-risked for sure, for the rest of the year. Siti Panigrahi : Great. And a quick follow-up, basically clarification. Your online services growth, 21%, but if I exclude Mailchimp, it's around 27% growth. That's quite impressive, like just compared to like Q1, 28%. Just want to clarify that I'm looking at it right. Sasan Goodarzi : You are -- we didn't break out the number. But, yes, you're looking at it right, because, in essence, online services, minus, Mailchimp grew faster. So therefore, just by design, it grew much faster than 21%. So you are correct. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : You're very welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Michael Turrin : Hey, great. I appreciate you taking the question. Nice job on the quarter. Maybe one for Michelle while you're still with us, on margin. Last quarter, you took the Credit Karma outlook down but left the EPS guide intact. We've gotten questions from investors around whether that provides maybe less wiggle room on margin, but the first couple of quarters have still shown EPS upside. So can you just walk through the margin levers you're finding? Are there advantages in folding various brands together and just how we should think about the longer-term margin potential there? Michelle Clatterbuck : Yes. Thank you, Michael. I appreciate the question. We \u2013 yes, we absolutely have felt very strongly about being able to still keep our guidance for op income for margin, even though we did take down our revenue guidance last quarter. And that's actually something that we were very plantful about as we went through our three in one year planning process. We had identified a number of levers that we could pull across the expense horizon. A lot of that is in marketing. Some of it's in travel and some other discretionary type expenses so that we would be able to still hit our bottom line financial commitments and that's what we have done. And we feel very good about the guidance that we've given for the rest of the year. But it is something that we take very seriously, and we make sure that we do have those levers that we can pull, given different macro environment as that has unfolded this year. Michael Turrin : It's very helpful. Just one more, if I may. The desktop business came in exceptionally strong. Can you just speak to what you're finding as you move that base for subscription? And then how to think about the revised small business target after we're through the migration journey there and what keeps the 15% growth sustained afterwards. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, Michael, maybe I will take that. First of all, I'll just start with context. This is a business model shift that we're actually quite excited about in that. One, we've shifted the customers to subscription, so it's far more predictable. Two, in that context, we have had a very planful process of aligning prices between desktop and our online products. And the reason this is really important is we've been heavily investing in the last several years really ensuring that some of the key capabilities for our desktop customers, particularly those product-based businesses, that those capabilities are available in online. And being in the middle of this business model transition, one, we see another 1.5 years of continued strength, but we also see ahead of that, the fact that we can now migrate these customers through our online platform, because we now have the capabilities that they need. And by the way, when we do that \u2013 that actually opens up the doors to additional online services to continue to fuel the success of our small businesses. And therefore, when you step back, ultimately, the growth of this franchise will come from online. And with all of the innovation growth levers we have, moving up-market, that is what continues to give us a lot of confidence in our 15% to 20% long-term expectations for the small business franchise. Michael Turrin : Thanks very much. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. And I\u2019ll add my congratulations. I was wondering if you can drill down into the favorable trend that you're seeing from higher effective prices. In particular, for QuickBooks Online Accounting, just in terms of the magnitude and the duration of that impact. And I'm curious if that should continue to provide any kind of material uplift for the next several quarters. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thanks for your question, Mark. Let me start with context that we always look at our largest growth across the company, no matter what the business is to come from volume and mix. And those two are driven, of course, by our innovation and/or if we are moving up market, which in many cases across our businesses, we are moving upmarket. In TurboTax, the example is moving into the assisted segment. So price and mix are really the largest drivers. And because of just the vast and accelerated innovation, we also have price as a leverage because we always want to be disruptive from the bottom, and we want to continue to disrupt at the top. And that actually gives us a lot of pricing power because of the value equation and the benefits that we deliver for our customers. And so with that as context, looking ahead, not just the next couple of quarters, but looking in terms of just the long-term durability of Intuit and how we think about things, we believe the majority of our growth will continue to come from volume and mix and price will always be a lever because particularly that we are moving upmarket. And I think it was even more pronounced in small business because of the business model shift in desktop, where we are bringing pricing to parity with online and we just -- we expect that to continue in the next several quarters, but that there's a durability element of this, not just a quarterly element for this. Mark Murphy : Okay. Understood. And then as a quick follow-up, on the Mailchimp side, are the initiatives that are designed to stimulate higher growth for MailChimp, which I think has been including the very creative advertising campaigns you've had out there. Are those starting to take hold and produce an effect in terms of whether we look at e-mail marketing, campaign volumes or seeing customers opt in to the right products there where they run the AB test and kind of connect back with the rest of the ecosystem. Is that something you see starting to take hold currently or in the next couple of quarters as well? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Mark, I would say that when you think about the priorities that we talked about in the focus areas, we are starting to see green shoots, and we started seeing green shoots a couple of quarters ago. And sort of the biggest one is conversion in paid. The one -- in addition to the initiatives starting to deliver green shoots that we are the most excited about is the work that we are doing to retain our high-value customers and to really penetrate in mid-market. This is really the same story that we talked about in mid-market with QuickBooks Advance, where our retention was actually not quite that high when it came to our high-value customers in QuickBooks. And we built a platform and really a team to focus on these mid-market customers. And that is really one that I'm very excited about, and I think we'll see the results of that in the next two to three quarters, where we'll start making a bigger impact in not only retaining our high-value customers, but also penetration in mid-market. And that's also in context of all the other things that we've talked about doing, which is campaign redesign, web redesign, first-time use, one-hour assisted onboarding and now what we just shared earlier in the script, which we said it's coming, and that is the Data Sync. The Data Sync is huge, because now it puts the customer data and purchase data all in one place, and it really puts the power of growth in the hands of customers in a way where they can't get that fuel anywhere else. And so, all these things take time, but we are seeing the green shoots. It will translate into faster revenue growth, sort of, in the coming quarters, which is, by the way, not embedded in our guidance, just to be clear, but we're excited about the progress that we're making. Mark Murphy : Thank you, very much. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the question. Sasan, I think everyone appreciates what's happening in Credit Karma, and there's only so much that's within your control. And within that context, it's great to hear all the goodness around how Credit Karma Guarantee is doing. But as we think about the other elements of the portfolio, the other products, in an environment that's supply-constrained, can you maybe just talk about the performance and how you're investing against the opportunity in context of what you can control? And how do you even know the progress perhaps that you're making in auto and in home, for example, if the market just isn't there to support it. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Brad, actually, a great question. And the reason it's such an important question is, we are very focused on delivering for our members in the near term and to your point, leading to this macro environment, but we are undeterred relative to the strategic focus areas for the business. And so, let me specifically answer your questions. First of all, let me start with a macro point, which applies to all of Intuit. At Intuit, there are outcomes that we declare that we monitor, but there are also inputs that we focus on. And inputs are key deliverables around product, around go-to-market, around technology investments, and each of our inputs have success measures. And we spend the majority of our time on inputs, because managing inputs and managing where you choose to invest is ultimately the biggest predictor of the outcomes that we want to achieve. So we're very intentional about delivering and managing in the near term for our customers and for you all, and we are undeterred relative to the focus areas that we are focused on in the long term, which are the inputs. With that as sort of uber context in terms of how we run the company, there are several areas that we continue to be focused on, and they're not new, but this is why we believe in the long-term growth of Credit Karma. One is Karma Guarantee. By the way, somebody is typing. So, hopefully, you all can hear me. But Karma Guarantee is a big time differentiator. This is where we use our data and our machine learning capabilities to, in essence, provide certainty that a customer is eligible for a credit card or a personal loan. And now 59% of our members are actually able to get a Karma Guarantee offer, which is a huge deal. We're continuing to invest in that area with our financial institutions and getting financial institutions onto our light box. The second is Credit Karma Money. This is huge, right? This is building out the other side of Credit Karma platform where, in essence, we're helping our members manage money, whether it's paying bills, early access to their money, early access of their refund, building their credit, finding ways to save money. And the more we -- members engage with Credit Karma money, the more their engagement goes up on the platform and the more we can monetize. So that's the second area. And the third area is what we've talked about in the last several quarters, which is our focus on prime customers. This is why we put Mint and Credit Karma together. We're very underpenetrated with our prime members, and we're building out services. And when we launch them, well, of course, you'll be the first to know to really begin to penetrate and monetize prime customers. And last but not least, this is very important. It's better together with TurboTax. It's all the investments that we are making because our goal is we want every Credit Karma member to use TurboTax, and we want every TurboTax customer to put their refund on Credit Karma Money account. So those are the four big areas of focus. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much for that, Sasan. If I could just ask a quick follow-up, maybe Michelle. Michelle, I appreciate that cash flow is lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. It looks like cash taxes had an impact in the first half of the year on free cash flow growth. But -- just in trying to reconcile your margin upside in the quarter with free cash flow performance, are there any items to call out? Any reasons why for the full year, we shouldn't expect free cash flow growth to be somewhat in line with net income growth? Thanks. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks for the question, Brad. Typically, that is exactly what we would expect. So I would say that this year, we could pretty much expect the same \u2013 that same trend to continue. Yes, we are going to have the lumpiness as we've always talked about, we have that throughout the year and given the way our quarters fall with tax and so forth. But yeah, I would expect that you would see that trend continue for the year. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Brad. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask a question here on TurboTax Full Service given that this is the first year that you're really making a push here with the offering and then we're getting into the tax season. Curious to get your perspective on whether you think this year might be the year you might see more conversion of existing TurboTax filers to full service or is this more of a net new filer coming into the franchise through full service or maybe over time, you shift more towards the latter as the brand gains some traction. Just curious on your expectations there, net new versus existing filers upgrading? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Brad. In fact, I'll start with something that we mentioned earlier, but it's really important in the context of your question, and that is our entire campaign strategy and all the investments that we've made in TurboTax Live as a platform has been to bring in prior year assisted customers. And these prior year \u2013 and by the way, our campaign, we'll talk about it in more detail right after tax season. But our campaign is certainly raising heads, and we are seeing more prior year-assisted customers come into the franchise because they see it as a great opportunity to digitally get their taxes done from wherever they are and get the expert help that they need. With that said, the way we think about TurboTax Live is it's really one platform. We are -- we don't look at like full service as just an attach. We look at -- there are those that will come in and choose to get help along the way. And there are those that will come in and digitally exchange all of the documents, had appointment, and have a discussion with our \u2013 expert that's been matched with them and then have us do their taxes for them. And I think we see the type of strength that we would have expected in this area in the \u2013 where we are in the season. With full service, you see more of that strength more towards the latter part of the season. But we're pleased with the halo effect that really it creates because that's what we're really after is to ensure that we communicate and deliver on the promise of, if you want to help with your taxes or you want us to do it for you, we're here for you. And it's the combination of that both campaign strategy and platform delivering on that promise. That is what we look for. With that said, the big change this year is one session virtual engagement where we can get your taxes one and done, and we're seeing success there. And I would also just say we're going to see a lot more sort of in March and April, and that's where this full-service offering will have the largest impact. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Enders from Citi. Your line is open. Steve Enders : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe just to follow up on the last TurboTax line questioning. I guess, so far, what have you seen in terms of kind of the broader adoption of some of those more full service offerings or even TurboTax Live in terms of driving the upside in the quarter? And I guess from a referral standpoint between credit card and TurboTax, I guess what kind of engagement have you seen between the two of those that drive that co-branded offering out there? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Very good question. A couple of things that I'll say. First of all, Steve, as we talked about earlier, we have just had a faster forming season this year, which is great because we're able to not only deliver for our customers, but these are folks that really need their money fast and we've seen a really strong uptake of putting their money on a Credit Karma Money account, which is exactly why we've got the integration between those two platforms. The second thing I would say, and of course, we'll share more tangible results when season is over. But I'm actually quite excited about what we are seeing this year relative to Credit Karma members, in essence, engaging with TurboTax. We spent a lot of sort of our investments in time this past five, six months to remove friction, to remove blockers, to make it much easier if you're a member to pick the right product and then get your taxes done, whether you want to do it yourself or we'll do it for you. So we're seeing good engagement on that front. And I think just last but not least, we're seeing strength with returning customers that use TurboTax Live coming back this year. And again, it's very early in the season. We're actually excited about all the possibilities of acquiring new customers as we look at the rest of the season, particularly because of our campaign. That's raised a lot of heads that we typically wouldn't have raised. So more to come when season is over. And by the way, we're iterating real-time, making product improvements real-time, launching new features every seven days. So we're excited about the game that's ahead of us and where we are as we sit today. Steve Enders : Okay. Great. There's helpful context there. And just a quick one, if I could get it in here on -- and just on the EPS outlook, I guess, how should we think about what's being put more to work on in terms of the marketing, how much more is getting kind of being put to work there versus conservatism, such as inherent in the model at this point because just seeing really good upside in the past couple of quarters and not necessarily seeing a raise on the EPS side. So just would love to kind of get your thoughts on that. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, yes, absolutely. It's a very, very good question because if you just do the math, what we've delivered the first half of the year and you look at where we're going to deliver the second half of the year, it would suggest significant deceleration. So thank you for asking the question. I would say everything that we talked about across all the businesses stands. We're confident in our guidance and we're confident in what we're seeing in the businesses and where each business sits. I think the reality is, generally, we have a principle, we don't touch our guidance while we're heading into our third quarter. Our third quarter is double the revenue of any other quarter. And so, we'd like to get to the third quarter and then talk to you all about what our guidance is moving forward. So really, the way you should think about our guidance is it's derisked. Steve Enders : Perfect. Appreciate taking the questions. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Thank you, very much. Congratulations on a strong quarter. Michelle, we\u2019ll definitely miss your smile and energy. Sandeep, look forward to working with you. Back to you, Sasan. You digitized taxes, which were done annually, what not like decades ago. Now you're about to digitize payments. I'm curious, as you look at payments, what are the parts of the payments ecosystem that Intuit is not traditionally played in. I know that you've quantified $125 billion of transactions going through your network, vis-\u00e0-vis $2 trillion or so that's transacted more broadly speaking. And listen to your comments on payments, it sounds like that is the big kahuna here. You can demystify what parts of the payments ecosystem has Intuit not participated in before and which parts would you be able to participate in going forward? You mentioned B2B, accounts payable, receivable, et cetera, that would help frame how much of an opportunity payments is. It's a small -- it's one of your smallest businesses, but it looks like it's got the biggest growth potential. Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you for the question, Kash. And I just have to start by saying, we've got a lot of octane in the tank left across all of our Big Bets. I love all of my five children. But I'll answer your question around payments. I think there are three things. And let me -- 30 seconds of context, and I'll specifically answer your question, because we talked about payments and money movement a lot. One huge element of what happens on our platform is, small businesses come in, they create an estimate, they invoice and then they need to get paid for that invoice once they do the work. And our penetration in that -- we talk often about we have $2 trillion of invoices that are managed on our platform. Our penetration there is still low. And so, it's just important to start there and not move off of that, because that's a huge growth opportunity. It's a huge area of investment. And by the way, why in this macro environment where everybody's payments volumes are not accelerating or they're significantly decelerating, we still have 25% total charge volume growth. So that's number one. There's a lot of octane left there, and we are significantly focused. I think the other one that we've traditionally not focused on at all, is this entire B2B network, which is digitizing business to business between our small businesses. We now have the capabilities. We launched the business network last quarter to millions of our QuickBooks customers. That is a big opportunity, of course, very low -- no penetration, because we didn't have it before, and it's 70% checks. So that's a big one. And then part of that is also just bill pay capabilities, which we've had on our platform through a couple of really strong partners. And now we're building that capability ourselves, because we believe that it can deliver a far seamless experience for our customers. And then, when you take all of that and go to mid-market, it's even a bigger opportunity, which is why we're seeing the strength in our mid-market growth, because of just the size of payments and payroll that takes place. So, hopefully, that answers your question Kash Rangan : That is allowing you to participate in these vectors that you couldn't previously access. And that's it for me. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Absolutely. Thank you, Kash. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Congratulations Michelle and Sandeep. Sasan, first question is going to be in tax category. It's kind of a multi-partner. Yeah. This the early season in the industry, the IRS is clearly up year-over-year significantly, and that's probably good for you in multi \u2013 for multiple reasons, like you just mentioned, the Credit Karma Money probably helped. But \u2013 just love your thoughts on the industry, why you think it's up so much this year versus last year to start and then it's still way behind in -- through mid-February versus pre-pandemic. So just kind of high-level thoughts on the kind of the cadence of this tax season, the start and how that may influence the tax season and your view of it overall? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Scott. I love the question, because this is actually important for everybody to hear since you see the IRS reports on a weekly basis. It's almost \u2013 if I were to tell you all, it's almost hard for you all to pay attention to these reports because so much has changed and will continue to change. So let me start with context. Before COVID, before 2020, things were generally predictable, but things were continuing year in and year out to get pushed out to April. What do I mean by predictable. Generally, you would see a strong first peak, which went through mid-February and it would start end of January, and then you would sort of have very low volume and then you would have a lot of volume come in on the 14th and 15th of April. And what was happening every year, that curve was predictable \u2013 about what's happening is every year, more and more people pushed out to do their taxes on the 14 and 15 because there were solutions like ours where they could wait until last minute to do it. So that was pre-COVID. When COVID hit, when everybody sort of was locked up in their homes, when tax season got extended two years in a row, and now the fact that folks are actually working virtually, it completely blew up the curve and the habits of customers. And so what we are now seeing this season is initially, we saw a fast forming season similar to what would happen pre-COVID. A lot of people came in because they needed money. And what we're seeing now is \u2013 what we've been seeing, which is a lot of people are pushing out to complete their taxes sort of last minute. But what's very difficult, I know for you all to compare, we have a lot of internal data so we can assess what's happening is that it's hard to compare year-over-year, because there's so much that changed in the last several years. And again, what we're seeing this year is now people are at work, but remember, they're still generally working in a hybrid environment. So even days of the week, times of the day when their taxes is not comparable to last year. But generally speaking, fast forming and then a bunch of people are going to do their taxes in the last several days of April before taxes are due is the way you should think about it. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks. I appreciate all that color. Next one, a follow-up. Over in Credit Karma Guarantee, you've discussed it a good bid on this call. But when you gave guidance for Credit Karma at the beginning of the year, you were really excited about Guarantee contributing in the back half. I may be a quarter or two early here asking this question. You mentioned the 59% penetration of the base. Just curious, how are you tracking this? Is this ahead of where you expected to be at this point? And could it be, in fact, a driver. You mentioned de-risk guidance for Credit Karma segment. Is this -- how are you progressing on Guarantee? Is this going to be really meaningful through the back half tax? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, yes, sure. First of all, let me start with my comments where the guidance for the company is derisked. That includes Credit Karma. So my comments weren't just about Credit Karma, it was really about the whole company because if you just do the math, it seems that we are significantly decelerating the second half of the year versus the first half of the year and that's the point I made, which is principally, we don't touch guidance until we get to our largest quarter, which is this quarter. And so therefore, the way to think about our guidance is that it's derisked. That includes Credit Karma. The second thing is, if you recall, when Michelle and I talked about when we reset the Credit Karma guidance to minus 15% to minus 10%, what we talked about is, one, we feel the new guidance was very prudent. We also really built in some deterioration in the second half of the year and we didn't count on our innovation having the kind of impact we initially had assumed in our first guidance. And I think that still stands. With that said, I actually feel very good about where we are. I would say we are where we want it to be because we have very high goals with Karma Guarantee. 59% of our members now having at least one Karma Guarantee offer is really a big deal. So I feel good in terms of the progress we're making on that front, the front of Credit Karma Money with the integration with TurboTax. Those are all -- our input goals in those areas are on track, and it will be fun to watch how they play out the rest of the year, but we're not relying on that to achieve our guidance. Scott Schneeberger : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, very welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks, Sasan, online services was slower than QBO accounting at 27%. So I think I just wanted clarify, was the weakness really just in Mailchimp or was there any weakness you saw in payments or payroll? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Brent, two over points. The first one is you're always going to see toggling between online accounting growth rate and online services growth rate. What you really should pay attention to is the overall growth rate. With that said, to answer your question, we actually saw strength across the board. Mailchimp, our growth is what brought down the online services growth to 21% because it is growing slower then, of course, it's growing low teens, but it was really driven down by Mailchimp. And Mailchimp is growing low teens, similar to last quarter, but that was really the primary reason a little bit very small amount by payments now growing at 25%, but really, it's Mailchimp. Brent Thill : Follow-up on Mailchimp, do you feel that is more internal execution of getting the product right and not wanting to push it out until it's ready, or is there something competitive going on that you're seeing that's maybe distracting? Sasan Goodarzi : No. It's really -- we have very clear priorities put great leaders in the business. I was actually just in Atlanta about three weeks ago, spent more than a day with the entire team, and it's just really execution. And I feel very good about the focus areas, the progress on our execution, it is in our control, which is sort of a great place to be in. It's not macro, it's us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great quarter. I guess, maybe just two quick ones. Sasan, first, if I count the amount of times you said derisk on this call with respect to the guidance, I think that's definitely great to hear, but if you think about like the KPIs that you're seeing in real time around the macro and the SMB, like, what would you say -- how would you compare them to the trend line that you saw last quarter and where do you see them kind of going from a macroeconomic perspective and influencing the demand environment? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Good question, Alex. Let me start with small business. And given that we have 10 million-plus small businesses on our platform and by the way, with the way they're digitizing it's probably best to just talk specifically about the data that we are seeing. If you go back to last quarter, what I had mentioned is, small businesses generally still have strong cash reserves. They're using some of those cash reserves to continue to invest in their business. And they're still hiring. They're still having a little bit of a hard time hiring, but they are still hiring. They couldn't find talent. But then there are sectors like financial services, real estate, auto that were down nearly 15% in revenue year-over-year. If I forwarded to the data that we're seeing now, this quarter, two things. One, they're continuing to hire, and they're actually finding it easier to hire. And those same industries that I just mentioned, real estate, financial services and auto have actually kicked off in performance. Their performance is better. Like, for instance, I think real estate and financial services are -- they were down like 15% plus, and now they're down less than 10% as an example. And auto, believe it or not, was down minus 2% versus the minus sort of 10% to 15%, it was down. So we're actually seeing an uptick and improved performance in our base in those areas that were actually hit the hardest. So that's sort of the macro environment that I would say. And I would actually reiterate what Michelle and I talked about earlier, which is, our focus and innovation on payments is working, because although consumer spending has moderated a bit, our total charge volume is growing 25%, which is quite healthy and significant. So that's what we're seeing on the small business side. On the Consumer side, two things I would say. And remember, we have nearly 100 million consumers on our platform. So this is really indicative of the world outside of our platform. Since March of last year, credit scores are down about 13 points and credit card balances are up a little bit over 20%. Those that are hit the hardest are those that are in the credit band of 600 to 660, where their average balance on their credit card is like $9,000. So that's the -- a little bit of the state of the world on the consumer side. Hopefully, that answers your question, Alex. Alex Zukin : Yes. That was actually extremely detailed. So I really appreciate that. And then, I guess, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you a question about generative AI and how we're, if at all, Intuit has plans to monetize or integrate that technology. It does seem like having your own personal financial digital assistant or a live plus functionality would kind of seem logical, but would be really interested to kind of get a sense of how you're all thinking about it. Sasan Goodarzi : Alex, I'm glad you got it in. I'm surprised it took till the top of the hour for somebody to ask, so thank you for asking. It's actually a really important question. And I want to take you all back to \u2013 AI is core to our strategy. And now that everybody is talking about AI, I'm actually delighted because hopefully, it will expose to all of you why four years ago, when we refreshed our strategy, it was about being an AI-driven expert platform. And the investments that we've made in data and AI is really what's fueled a lot of our innovation across the company. And as you heard us talk about at Investor Day, it's why we put Marion in front of you all, we're just at the beginning of the curve as to what's possible. So first and foremost, the investments around data and AI is, what's fueling our success. And we've been looking at generative AI. In fact, there are multiple areas across our platform, where we've launch some of the capabilities of generative AI because it's all about reducing work and finding ways to put more money in your pocket with confidence, and it actually helps our experts. The key areas that we are focused on working with a couple of companies in this area is accuracy. And it will become more accurate over time, but we deal with people's money. And that matters in terms of the advice that we give. For us, this is all an accelerant, which, by the way, we've been working on for many, many, many months before this became sort of the buzz. But AI is core to our strategy. So we're delighted with the possibilities of the future. Alex Zukin : Awesome. Thank you, guys. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Well, listen, thank you, everybody, for your time. Thank you for your wonderful questions. Once again, I want to thank Michelle for 20 years at Intuit. She'll be back with us, by the way. She's with us through August, and delighted with Sandeep joining us as our new CFO in August. But with that said, we'll talk to you at next earnings until then, be safe, be good. Talk soon. Bye, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Abby. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's third quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in our press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Third quarter revenue grew 7%, lower than our expectations, reflecting a unique tax season, while we exceeded operating income and earnings per share guidance. We continue to see strong growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, which grew 21% in the quarter. Our overall performance this year demonstrates the strength of our platform and portfolio, including our ability to maintain earnings power in uncertain times while investing in the most important areas to drive long-term durable growth. We are raising our total company fiscal year 2023 revenue, operating income, earnings per share guidance. I am very proud of our team, as we now expect revenue and operating income to grow double digits, and margins to expand even more than previously guided. Let's turn to tax. While this was a unique tax season, we are making good progress transforming the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. This year, we expect overall IRS returns to decline 2% through July 31, below our original expectations for total returns to grow 1%, which was more in-line with historical trends. We also expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to decline nearly 0.75 point, also below our expectation. We believe the IRS and DIY category declines are driven by those who filed in order to receive pandemic-era stimulus and tax credits during the past several years but did not file taxes this season. As a reminder, every point of IRS return growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth, and every point of DIY category share growth equals about 2.5 points of TurboTax revenue growth. The expected decline in total IRS returns and DIY category share equates to an approximate $200 million of negative impact to revenue for TurboTax, versus our original expectations. We expect our share of total IRS returns to be down approximately 80 basis points this fiscal year, primarily reflecting pandemic-era stimulus filers who did not file taxes this season. Each tax season has been unique since the pandemic began four years ago, although average annual trends over this period are far more in-line with longer-term trends. Over this four-year period, we expect total IRS returns to be up approximately 1%, the DIY category share of total returns to be up 0.75 point, and our share of total returns to be up approximately 20 basis points, and average revenue per return to be up 9 points. These trends exclude users of the TurboTax Free file offering in prior-year periods. Our strategy to transform the assisted category with TurboTax Live is working, given the growth we have experienced in an environment where IRS returns are declining. We expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 13% this year, with TurboTax Live revenue up 19%, and total average revenue per return to grow 12%. While TurboTax Live has driven strong growth over the last six tax seasons, we still have an immense opportunity to penetrate and transform the assisted tax segment at an accelerated rate. This remains our top priority as we prepare for next year. Turning to small business, while we are not immune to the macro environment, our platform is resilient. Total online payment volume growth moderated 5 points from Q2, growing 20%. Despite this, the shift to digitization and the power of our small business platform resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow. We continue to see strength in the areas that have the greatest impact, including growth of our online mid-market customers, contributing to strong subscription revenue and higher ARPC. In Q3, growth in both the number of companies running online payroll and the number of employees paid on our platform remained strong. Our small business platform, including QuickBooks and Mailchimp, remains critical to our customers' success. Let me now step back and talk about our company game plan to win. Four years ago, we declared our strategy to become the global AI-driven expert platform and five big bets as the primary areas of focus to drive durable growth. We invested heavily in our data and AI capabilities to deliver accelerated innovation. Today, we have over 100 million customers on our platform and use 400,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 55,000 tax and financial attributes per consumer to power 58 billion machine learning predictions per day. The acquisitions of Credit Karma and Mailchimp each contributed a rich and additive data set, which helped to deliver a 360 degree view of our customers. The scale of our data is an important competitive advantage and building block for our existing and future innovation with AI. We are accelerating re-imagining our customer experiences with generative AI capabilities, which we believe will be a driver of our long-term growth. Our platform capabilities are key to continued acceleration across all five of our Big Bets. I would like to highlight some examples of recent progress across these Big Bets. As a reminder, our Big Bets are : revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our first big bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. This data and technology bet is foundational to everything we do. We began investing in generative AI two years ago to accelerate our ability to fuel the success of consumers and small businesses. We implemented generative AI in Mailchimp, powering the Email Content Generator, enabling customers to create faster email campaigns based on industry, marketing intent and brand voice. We deployed large language models, which recognize, summarize, and generate text, in our virtual expert platform to automatically summarize calls, reduce call times by hundreds of thousands of hours per year and reduce work for experts while improving efficiency. Our strategic investment in data and AI over the last four years positions us to lead through this technological shift, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months. With our third Big Bet, our vision is for Credit Karma to become a comprehensive, self-driving financial platform that propels our members forward wherever they are on their financial journey. We are focused on growing Credit Karma Money, increasing member confidence to access financial products with Karma Guarantee, building out a richer experience for prime members, and becoming the financial platform of choice for consumers with the seamless integration of Credit Karma and TurboTax. We are innovating across all verticals and continue to have confidence in our long-term revenue growth expectations of 20% to 25%, despite near-term headwinds. I'll share a few examples. This season, we further streamlined the TurboTax filing experience into the Credit Karma app, and the number of customers using the experience to file their taxes was over five times higher than last year. With Credit Karma Money, we are innovating to help members get faster access to cash and make financial progress. This year, we saw over 45% growth in the number of TurboTax Online customers who received a refund advance in a Credit Karma Money account. This integration allowed approved members to get money in their hands in as little as one minute after the IRS accepted their return, and drove increased debit card purchase activity, contributing to a more than 100% increase in Credit Karma Money revenue during the quarter. Members who use this offering show higher engagement on Credit Karma, which creates additional monetization opportunities over time. With the Mint team now part of Credit Karma, we are building a new experience for members with prime credit scores, where Credit Karma is underpenetrated today. During the quarter, we began rolling out Net Worth, which helps prime members better understand their wealth. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payroll, our U.S. QBO payroll customers grew double digits this quarter, and the mix of online customers choosing our high-end offerings increased by over 1 point, driving higher ARPC. And in payments, we continue to innovate to drive digitization, from creating an estimate, to invoicing a customer to getting paid. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit, and Get Paid Upfront, are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, leading to 20% total online payment volume growth this quarter. We are making significant progress digitizing B2B payments, to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses, and ultimately improve their cash flow. We see a tremendous opportunity as 70% of B2B transactions are still completed with checks. Following our launch of the QuickBooks Business Network to millions of QBO customers in January, we are piloting our own native bill pay solution, and launched the initial beta of this functionality in QuickBooks earlier this month. Turning to Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp : first, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and eCommerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This quarter, we made great progress against these priorities. We're continuing to see better paid conversion, improving retention versus last quarter, and stronger paid customer growth. This, along with higher revenue per customer, drove a several point acceleration in revenue growth versus last quarter. Let me share some details around our progress : To help introduce new customers to Mailchimp and drive customer growth over time, we introduced free trials, similar to what we offer for QBO. In early testing, this is already driving higher paid conversion and a mix shift into our higher end offerings. To drive stronger retention of mid-market customers, we continue to leverage our virtual expert platform to offer assisted onboarding, with the goal of guiding these customers to more advanced features, and increasing awareness and usage. This quarter, we saw more than 7 point increase in high value customers going through this onboarding process versus last quarter, which we expect to help drive stronger retention over time. To drive accelerated global growth and execute our refreshed international strategy, we're translating the product into multiple languages. Early results indicate this translation work is driving increased activations, and ultimately can drive revenue growth. And our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market, representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, of which 700,000 are already in our franchise today. Online mid-market customer growth remains strong, and we are driving ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers across our full ecosystem of services. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy, we are innovating at high velocity, using the power of our platform, modern technology capabilities, data sets, and artificial intelligence to deliver new offerings at scale. This is helping us put more money in our customers' pockets, saving them time, and ensuring complete confidence in every financial decision they make. We are well positioned to power prosperity for the people and communities that we serve, as we enter this next technological shift. Now, let me hand it over to Michelle. Michelle Clatterbuck : Thanks, Sasan. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $6 billion; GAAP operating income of $2.8 billion versus $2.4 billion last year; non-GAAP operating income of $3.4 billion versus $2.9 billion last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $7.38 versus $6.28 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $8.92 versus $7.65 last year. Turning to the business segments. Consumer Group revenue of $3.3 billion grew 3% in Q3. There are four primary drivers of our Consumer business. This data reflects our expectations through July 31, 2023 versus the prior year through July 31, 2022. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. We expect total returns to decline 2% this year. This is below our original expectations of up 1%, as overall industry growth continues to reflect the multi-year impact from the pandemic. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category of total IRS returns to be down nearly 0.75 point by the end of the fiscal year, below our original expectations. The third is our share. We expect our share of total IRS returns to decline by approximately 80 basis points this fiscal year, primarily reflecting pandemic-era stimulus filers who did not file this season. As a result of these same industry dynamics, we expect our retention to decline this year. The fourth is average revenue per return, which we expect to increase 12% this year, as we expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 13%, with TurboTax Live revenue up 19%. Historically, each point of total IRS returns growth corresponds to approximately 1 point of revenue growth for the Consumer Group and each point of DIY category share growth corresponds to approximately 2.5 points of revenue growth for the Consumer Group. Using these historical sensitivities, the expected decline in total IRS returns and DIY category share equates to an approximate $200 million negative impact to revenue for the Consumer Group versus our original expectations. As a result of this expected decline in IRS returns, we anticipate total customers to decline 5% this year. We expect TurboTax Online paying customers to decline 1% this year, and a total of over 11 million customers who pay us nothing, down from 13 million last year. We now expect full year Consumer Group revenue growth of 5% to 6% versus our prior guidance of 9% to 10%, reflecting the expected declines in IRS returns and DIY category share I mentioned earlier. Looking back over the last four years, including our updated guidance for this fiscal year, we expect our revenue to have grown over 10% on average annually, in-line with our long-term expectations. We continue to anticipate Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long-term. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue declined 5% in Q3. For the full year, we now expect ProTax revenue growth of 2% to 3%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 21% during the quarter, and online ecosystem revenue grew 23%. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 25% in Q3, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix-shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 21% in Q3. Mailchimp revenue growth in the quarter accelerated several points from low-teens growth last quarter. Growth was driven by higher effective prices and customer growth. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix-shift to higher end offerings. Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q3. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 16% in the third quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew approximately 20%. We are just over half-way through a three-year transition to a subscription model for our desktop accounting solutions, making this revenue more predictable. We also raised our desktop prices for several products last September to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem revenue growth next quarter and as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. We will continue to build out our online ecosystem, and help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings when they're ready. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be our growth catalyst longer-term. As a result of the strong growth we are seeing in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, we are raising our full year segment revenue growth guidance to 24% from 19% to 20%. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $410 million in Q3, down 12%. As a reminder, Credit Karma represented 14% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022. On a product basis, the decline was driven primarily by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto loans and auto insurance, partially offset by growth in Credit Karma Money and credit cards. We are seeing more stability across our core verticals. In both credit cards and personal loans, we continued to see some partners tighten eligibility, while some expanded eligibility during the quarter. In personal loans, we continue to see partners facing funding constraints. We added more partners to the platform to help diversify our partner base. However, we continue to expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after very strong growth in fiscal 2022. We are updating our full year Credit Karma revenue growth guidance to a decline of 11% from a decline of 15% to 10%. Our financial principles guide our decisions, remain our long-term commitment, and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash and investments and $6.6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $483 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, payable July 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I've shared consistently in the past, we have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term, and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results, while investing in what is most important for future growth. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward looking and adjust quickly. I am proud of the team for how effectively we have used our playbook to invest in the most important growth drivers to position Intuit for the future while maintaining earnings power this year, despite the macro impact we are experiencing. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance, we are increasing our fiscal 2023 guidance. This includes : total company revenue growth of 12% to 13%, up from prior guidance of 10% to 12% growth; GAAP operating income growth of 19% to 20%, up from prior guidance of 9% to 13% growth; non-GAAP operating income growth of 21%, up from prior guidance of 17% to 19% growth; GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow 7% to 8%, up from prior guidance of a decline of approximately 5% to 1%; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 20%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 17% growth. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 includes : revenue growth of 9% to 10%; GAAP loss per share of $0.34 to $0.29; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.43 to $1.48. We expect a significant increase in our cash tax payments related to fiscal 2023 as a result of the tax law changes that require capitalization of certain R&D costs. With the recent IRS disaster-area tax relief, we expect to pay approximately $700 million, related to fiscal 2023, in Q1 of fiscal 2024. You can find our full fiscal 2023 and Q4 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Excellent. Thank you, Michelle. I know you'll be with us for another couple of months, but since this is your last earnings call, I want to express my sincere appreciation for all that you have contributed to Intuit over the last 20 years. You have made me, my leadership team, and the entire company better, and I am forever grateful. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and our five Big Bets, and in an uncertain macro [Technical Difficulty] mission-critical than ever to our customers. Let's now open it up to your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. And Michelle, congrats on a phenomenal run. We will miss you next quarter for sure on the earnings call. I've got one for Sasan and maybe let me sneak one in for Michelle, especially since it is her last call. Sasan, how should we think about your big bet in helping customers overcome their lack of confidence by connecting them to Live experts in a world where generative AI is advancing at breakneck speed? Because I think you spoke about how you're using generative AI to deliver the Live platform. But how is Intuit positioned in a world where LLMs may be able to deliver human-like guidance interaction? And maybe for you, Michelle, your Consumer segment operating margin was consistent with last year despite the pressure on the top-line for all the reasons that you've mentioned. Just curious how much visibility that you might have had into how tax would play out and if you scale back investment at all perhaps even marketing dollars into the end of the season? Thanks so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Brad, thank you so much for your question. And I heard that I fell off when I was reading the last part of the scripts. So, if I have bad connection, I will switch phones and hop back to make sure I answer your question. But let me start with the question that you asked. First of all, I would take us back to what we declared four years ago. As you know, I've been on the record four-plus years ago to say that I believe, and we believe as a company, that artificial intelligence is going to ignite global growth. And I believe that it's the biggest thing next to what we've experienced over time with electricity and the Internet. It's that big and it's that critical of a platform of innovation, which is why data and AI have been core to our investments in the last four-plus years. And with that as context, it's why we've been investing, specifically, in machine learning, knowledge engineering, natural language processing, and several years ago, we really started accelerating our investments in generative AI. And if I take it back to your question around confidence, when we've talked about solving the biggest unsaid problem that customers have, which is around confidence, it is really about solving it by helping them feel confident in their decision. And it doesn't necessarily always mean people. And in fact, if you look at our interactions today across all of our platforms, a large number of our interactions is actually our machines that are solving the customers' large problems. The reason we are so excited about AI from four-plus years ago is that you couple our data, which is a 360 view of the customer, it's actually where Credit Karma and Mailchimp has played such an important role to add to our rich data sets, you couple that with the investments in AI and now with generative AI, we can actually accelerate penetrating non consumption. And this is across every customer that we serve, whether it's consumers, across Credit Karma, whether it's tax, whether it's small business, we have an incredible opportunity to accelerate, making things more easier, more digestible and more confident inspiring for our customers. And in fact, it's generative AI that gives us the ability to do things that we could never imagine possible because of the data that we have. So for us, we saw this as an accelerant several years ago. It's why we accelerated our investments and it's why we're so excited about the future, because the large language models, coupled with AI, coupled with machine learning and the investments that we've made, we believe that we can actually accelerate our innovation as we look ahead. And hopefully, I was loud and clear. Michelle Clatterbuck : Yes, that was good. And Brad, first of all, thank you for the kind words. Your question around our ability to maintain earnings power within CG, really it's a focus for us as the whole company and it started last year when we were going through our three- and one-year planning process. We assumed that there would be economic uncertainty this year. And so, as we were going through the process, we made sure that we had funded those things that were most important to delivering for customers and being able to drive our revenue growth. And then, we were made list of the levers that we had that we could pull as we went throughout the year to be able to maintain our earnings power. And those are some of the discretionary things we had, which were whether it's travel or advertising or moderating hiring. And so, our lower tax units also this year did result in lower expenses for that segment, specifically in customer success. But really, it's about us looking at maintaining not CG margins, but really at the company level and it started last year in planning. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. And goodbye to you, Michelle. We'll miss you. Question for Sasan and the team. Sasan, in order to get back to the targets of 8% to 12% longer-term in Consumer, you're going to have to reaccelerate the tax business. So, if we can go back to the basics from the old days, how does it -- do you plan to grow the category? And how do you gain share of that category? That would be great. And also, as it pretends to generative AI, does this open up more opportunities netted against maybe potentially new competitive entrants? Because there is a bare thesis, which I'm sure you will have a different view on that, that it actually makes it easier to file for taxes. Brad was talking about that -- Brad Zelnick, earlier. So, does it expand the opportunity set, at the same time attracting new competition? Or how do we think about how it nets out for you guys? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you for the question, Kash. So, a couple of things I would start with. I'll take your question around reaccelerating revenue growth. First of all, if I step back and look at the $200 million of impact that we experienced this year because of the lower number of returns and based on all the analysis that we've done, it's really the pandemic era filers that came in to get access to their stimulus into their tax credits. And those have, based on our own analysis, have really all now left in the category. One, we believe we'll get to sort of a more normal environment. That is really what drove the performance -- the lower performance than we expected this year. The second thing to get to your question around reacceleration, this is where I feel very good about the performance in an environment where there were lower returns with our TurboTax Live business. If you think about it, this is now $1 billion-plus business growing 19%. And I believe in the next several years, this will actually be the largest part of the TurboTax business. And it's really in context of getting after the $30 billion of TAM that is consumers that go to an assisted offering to get their taxes done or businesses that get their business tax done. And we believe based on what we learned this year with our full service offering that we have an enormous chance to be able to really penetrate at a much more accelerated rate as we look ahead. And therefore, very confident in not only our performance this year if you exclude the lower number of returns, but also the green shoots that we saw going into next year, inclusive of the fact that we had 5x of growth in the Credit Karma platform. And we learned a number of things that we're going to double down on going into next year. And let me couple that with your second question around AI, listen, I would say we were the ones four-plus years ago that said, and we're on the record, that we believe that AI will absolutely be disruptive. And it's why we made investments in data. Because AI, particularly generative AI, is really meaningless without data. And so, with the investments that we've made in having a 360 view of data for consumers and small businesses, we actually, Kash, see it as an incredible accelerant. And I'll just remind us of, we often talk about we have $300 billion TAM with 5% penetration. And most of our customers use Excel, Google Sheet, [indiscernible], whether it's a small business or a consumer, to manage their life, to manage their business or they go have a bookkeeper help them run their business. And the reason is it's 5%, because it's all comes down to confidence. So, we actually see our investments in the last four-plus years in data and AI with what we are now investing in with generative AI, we, for us, think it's an acceleration because we have incredible scale. We have data scale, AI scale, customer scale, and we have sort of rich data sets that is really undisputed, which means we can do things for customers that is hard for anybody else to do. So, we actually see it as an accelerant and we're excited about the possibilities, given the proof points that we've seen and given the investments that we are currently making. So that's the way we think about it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Yes. Congrats, Sasan, thanks for taking the question. And Michelle, good luck on your next endeavor. I guess, Sasan, can you just talk about the state of the small business? There's a lot of debate on that right now. Obviously, you all had a nice quarter in SBSE. Could you just talk about what you're seeing there in terms of the different verticals you play in and frankly the ability for you all to upsell some of your offerings like payroll payments? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure. Let me, Kirk, frame my answer in two dimensions. One, what we see across all small businesses on our platform and off of our platform. There's a couple of things that we see. One is, there is an impact to small businesses' revenue. They're still growing. It depends on the sector. But in aggregate, what we see is that they are still growing. But they also, depending on the sectors they serve, they have profit pressures. So if they're in real estate or if they're in lending, they certainly have more profit pressure than those that don't serve those sectors. We also see that customers -- we would -- we put them in the bucket of the older, more tenured customers, 70% of those customers actually have more cash reserves than they did pre-pandemic. It's more of the younger newer businesses that have started since the pandemic that generally they have less cash reserves than they [Technical Difficulty] sort of the state of the small businesses. They feel the impact and the pressure of the environment from consumer spending standpoint. But net-net, when you look in aggregate, they are still growing with some of the data points that I mentioned a moment ago. With that said, when we look at our platform, it's why we're just being -- continuing to be intentional about sharing the proof points that we shared today, our platform is not immune, but we are resilient. And so, when you look at some of the data points that we shared, our payments -- our total payments -- online payments volume is 20%, which is actually quite healthy, but it's down 5 points. At the same time, when we look at our overall performance across Mailchimp and QuickBooks, we actually are seeing strength in serving our mid-market customers and continuing to serve our customers that have been on the platform for a long time. The proof points that I shared was our customer growth in mid-market is strong, we're growing payroll -- U.S. payroll double digit, and we're actually seeing a migration to our higher-end payroll offerings. So, net-net, we are not immune, but we are resilient and we feel really good about the sustained growth that we've delivered and the trajectory of the KPIs that we see as we look into next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you for taking the question, guys. And Michelle, it's been great working for you -- with you over the years. So, congratulations on all the great work that you've done. Sasan, a question for you on just tax and kind of how unfolded throughout the season -- this season. I understand sort of overall filings down because of less people kind of getting the refunds, right? And I understand DIY is probably a bigger component of it. I don't quite understand why TurboTax loses a share in that dynamic. Like, what's the mechanism by which you guys get hit harder than others and therefore kind of lose share? That's question number one. And question number two, there has been some concern about an extended tax season and the ability for approximately 10% of filers to be able to file at a later date that pushes out of your fiscal year. You didn't mention that. Was there any significant impact from that side of the equation that some of this tax strength might just push into next fiscal year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure, Keith, great question. Let me start with your share question. First and foremost, the majority of -- in fact, we would say close to all of those that came into the category of taxes to get access to their stimulus dollars and to their tax credits that were not tax filers before, almost all of them came into the do-it-yourself category because it was so much easier and faster to get access to, in essence, all their credit. And those are the filers that we see that have left the do-it-yourself category. The reason our share is down as actually pure math. We're the largest share player in the do-it-yourself category and we got the largest share of those folks that actually came in during the pandemic era. And when they left the category just by pure math and the cohort of customers numbers that we review in our retention, what we, in essence, see is those cohort of customers that came in that did not file taxes before to get access to credits are the ones that left, which is actually what gives us confidence when we look at our key retention cohorts looking ahead, but also our TurboTax Live performance that we talked about earlier. So that's where -- that's how the share plays out. It's pure math. We got the majority of them and when they left the category, they left TurboTax. In terms of extensions, yes, there's dollars attached to it, Keith. But in context of $14 billion company, it's really -- we don't consider it material. So that's why we didn't show and I didn't really spend much time talking about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for taking my question. And Michelle, it was great working with you. Good luck with your next endeavor. And Sasan, I want to dig into Mailchimp. It's good to see that acceleration to mid- to high-teens growth in Mailchimp. So, could you talk about like you made some changes, how much of that contributed to growth versus what are you seeing in the demand environment? Is macro really a headwind at this point? What are you seeing in the spending pattern on marketing from your customer base? And how [sustainable] (ph) going forward? Sasan Goodarzi : Was the last part of your question how sustained is that going forward? Siti Panigrahi : Yes. Sasan Goodarzi : Okay. So thank you for the question. First of all, very consistent with what I've shared in the last probably 18 months or so, we felt and I felt very strongly that the opportunity that we had with Mailchimp is how we bring it together with QuickBooks to truly create one platform that becomes the source of truth for running your business. And in an environment where now we have access to, with our customers' permission, the data applying AI and generative AI, we can now shift the platform to a place where we can do everything for you and deliver insights to help you manage your cash flow, to help you grow your customers, and that's really the ultimate game changer that we are focused on. With that said, the thing that I've been very consistent with you all is that this is all about execution. So, all of the progress that you're seeing us talk about in Mailchimp is all better execution. It is not any macro tailwinds. This is from the talent that we've put in place at the leadership level and the talent that we have upgraded across Mailchimp to then end-to-end. We've been revamping the website. We have looking at business model innovation and our line-up that we've made improvements. We're improving the product. We're doubling down on mid-market. And not only getting our existing customers to understand what features and functionality that we have to deliver the benefit, which helps us with retention and expansion revenue, but also the new customers that we're getting, assisted onboarding and using a lot of our AI and virtual expert platform capability. So, those were sort of illustrative examples relative to why we're seeing paid conversion increase, paid customers increase or seeing better retention and better revenue per customer, it is all execution. And I expect this to continue to improve our execution, and coupling that with what we're doing across the QuickBooks platform, truly creating one platform that becomes a source of truth for your business. I am excited and bullish about the future possibilities of what we can do for small businesses, particularly with what's possible with data and gen AI. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. And Michelle, best wishes for sure. Sasan, I guess this is going to be a double tax question. The IRS is down 1% year-to-date, you're saying down 2% through the end of July. Just curious just what's going to take it down more in your eyes and how that looks in future years as you -- if you continue to think this is more just a pandemic-related [flow year] (ph) and we get back to normalcy? That's part number one. And part number two, historically, when we look at unit growth of TurboTax, which was -- you anticipate to be negative 5% and then revenue per return, which you anticipate to be plus 12%, usually A plus B equals the Consumer segment revenue growth, but you have -- and that would be 7-plus, but you're guiding 5% to 6%. So, is there conservatism in there? Or is there maybe some financial products that you were unable to sell, so you're getting a little less -- maybe it's not qualified as revenue per return but something else or maybe it's something that's not TurboTax related directly in the category? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, Scott. Let me take your first question. There are two assumptions that we are making based on all the data that we have and what we see from last year. One is, there was actually a lot more extensions last year than we view will take place this year even with the states that have pushed out. Plus last year, there were more filers. This is in the bucket of the pre-pandemic era or the pandemic era filers that came in to get their stimulus money in their tax credits. There was still a lot of those filers last year through July and little bit beyond. And so when we take out those filers, and we compare to the extensions last year, our view is that IRS will be down 2%, and so that has, of course, an impact, 2%, which has an impact on the performance that we talked about. Secondarily, we really did an incredible amount of analysis to make sure that we had an understanding of these pandemic era filers and are they all sort of out. And the reality is there's no more stimulus or tax credits to be had by those filers. So based on all of our analysis, they are out. And so therefore, we expect this year that IRS at a minimum is going to be flat. And of course, when we guide, we'll share with you what we've assumed in our guidance in August. But we would assume, at a minimum, it will be flat, maybe even up, but at a minimum, flat based on the reasons that I just mentioned. So that's the first part of your question. The second part of your question is a really good one, and I'll get to the specifics in a moment. I think just sort of reiterate even in an environment where IRS returns went down, our future is TurboTax Live. And our future is the growth of what we can do with our Live platform, especially with the data and AI capabilities. We have to really disrupt the assisted segment. And our real [accompass] (ph) going forward is going to be the growth of our TurboTax Live platform both in terms of customer growth and revenue growth. And I may just ask Michelle to weigh in on this, but this sort of comes down to just pure math in terms of when we look at our units and we look at what folks paid for and sort of adds up to the 12 point speed up in ARPC. It's really nothing beyond that. But let me just ask Michelle. Michelle, would you weigh in on that point at all beyond what I just shared? Michelle Clatterbuck : Sorry. I'm having trouble with the mute button there. No, Sasan, some of it can just be also rounding with units and returns. And so, I wouldn't get overly concerned on that, Scott. Sasan Goodarzi : Got it. So the headline is, the 12 point in ARPC growth is sort of very tangible relative to the units that we got. Michelle Clatterbuck : Yes. You got the 12 points of ARPC. And then as you said Scott, we shared, we expect the units to be down 5%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple more on tax. I think you mentioned before that overall retention, because of the factors you mentioned on the call already, is going to be down this year. But could you focus in on just Live retention given how important that's going to be for the future of the platform? How did that shake out this year? And if you could share in terms of Live customer growth, are you getting more from takeaways from competitors? Or is these DIY customers trading up to Live? Any color you can provide there would be helpful. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Daniel. First of all, yes, you're right in what you heard us say earlier, which is we would expect retention to be down 1 point-plus. And we'll talk about it, of course, more at Investor Day. And it's really because of these pandemic-era filers that came in and have now left the categories. Overall, we like the mix of what we've seen across our Live platform, and we'll share again more of the specifics as we get into Investor Day. But our retention and sort of existing customers coming back, we felt very good about what we expected and what we saw. I would say the second thing is it's a mix. It's a mix of both those that did taxes themselves the prior year that ultimately chose to upgrade to a sort of a Live platform because something changed in their life, inclusive of getting customers that were prior year assisted. And remember, our -- really, our competition is those that go to mom-and-pop shop. It's the 88 million folks where the majority of them will ultimately go to a local mom-and-pop shop to get their taxes done, and that's where we get a lot of the switches also from those mom-and-pop shops. So, we have a good mix of retention. Those that did taxes themselves last year and chose to use the Live platform because of a confidence question or some concern and then getting those that were prior assisted. And that's a mix we like, and that's a mix we believe will continue. Now it will be different as we take full service to either further scale, because we believe we'll accelerate full service penetration at a much higher rate than even today. So that's the way I would have you think about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. One question on Credit Karma. You kind of raised the guidance there, and that came after a quarter where we had a lot of turmoil in the financial services industry with the regional banks, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw this quarter in terms of the extra headwinds that obviously played out there, but you're actually doing better than what you had guided previously? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : We're actually continuing to see strength based on our innovation in a couple of areas. One is in cards and in some parts driven by our Karma Guarantee, which is really unique to Credit Karma, where the certainty is very high for a member to get approved for what they are looking for because of the data and AI capabilities that we have. The second is Credit Karma Money. And this is where, as I always have shared, we are building a consumer platform to be the destination for consumers with the integrations that we're doing with TurboTax and Credit Karma. And in essence, we saw a 45% increase in the number of TurboTax customers that chose to put their money on a Credit Karma Money account. And not only do we make some revenue on that, but over time, based on the higher frequency of the engagement, we can ultimately monetize even further, which were not in the numbers that I just mentioned. So really, it's across our innovation across cards and Credit Karma Money. That's why we saw the performance that we saw in the quarter. And then with one quarter left in the year, we, of course, have confidence to improve the guidance that we provided to what Michelle shared earlier. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Jackson Ader : Great. Thanks for taking our questions guys. We saw the press release related to the IRS direct filing program, but I just thought maybe, Sasan, if we could hear what you're thinking are maybe the largest potential threat of that study that came out as part of the Inflation Reduction Act last year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. I'll share a couple of perspectives that is really consistent with what we've talked about, but this is probably an important time to reiterate how we think about it. First and foremost, I can't vouch for their study. I can simply vouch for the facts that we have and the facts that are already in the market. And I think the first one is free tax software is already available to all consumers, and the awareness is actually quite high. That's the first thing that I would just remind us of. I think the second thing I would say is a reminder of this will yet be another free tax software in the marketplace. And I would just say, if you look at the last four-plus years, there were several entrants, big entrants, into the free tax software. One was Credit Karma before we acquired them, where they have 100 million-plus customers, a trusted platform. And they entered into the market of providing free tax software with sort of very little to no impact. And then another very large player that we sold Credit Karma tax to when we acquired Credit Karma. And you can, of course, observe what their results are. The point is that free tax software is already available, has been available to every consumer, and the awareness is extremely high. And so to have another sort of free tax software that's available is really immaterial is the way we think about it. And I'll remind us, by the way, it's actually not free. This is going to cost taxpayers billions of dollars, and so it's really not free. And I think the last thing I would say is really back to our vision. Our vision has been from what we declared four years ago to really become a consumer platform of choice, which means that beyond serving you to help you get your taxes done, we're delivering benefits through Credit Karma beyond tax, which means we can monetize beyond tax. And really out of the $35 billion TAM in tax, less than $5 billion to do-it-yourself. And really, our biggest opportunity is the other $30 billion we're going after, $20 billion of it being consumers that have somebody else get their taxes done and $10 billion being business tax. That's our future. That's our presence. That's where we are focused. And so net-net, when I think about the IRS study that was announced, I think it's a study. Facts are friendly, you look at the facts in the marketplace, this is for us, this is really not a threat at all. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around the TurboTax ARPU number. Such a nice increase that you're expecting this year, 12%. Could you help unpack that a little bit for us, please? Obviously, TurboTax Live was a key driver there. I guess two questions. Were there other contributors here, premium mix shift or other items perhaps? And then also on TT Live, what would you attribute the strength to? We've seen the ads this tax season; \"Don't do your taxes, we'll do them for you.\" Is it just growing awareness of QuickBook -- sorry, of TurboTax as a solution to help with assisted? You've been at this for a number of years. So just kind of, I guess, what's working there? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Brad. A couple of things. You actually nailed that our ARPU increase on top of ARPU increases in the last several years has come from TurboTax Live. It is a disruptive price offering. At the same time, it's got much higher ARPU and some of the more premium customers that chose -- they're either self-employed or they're investors and, of course, chose our premium SKU, which has a higher ARPU. So those are a couple of big drivers. I would tell you that the thing that I am sort of most excited about where the insights and the learnings that we got this year that really informs what we're going to double down on right now as we prepare for next year. One is full service. Full service is not an offering that is -- has product market fit. It's at scale. It -- we got an 84 Net Promoter Score this year, which is the highest Net Promoter of anything across the company we have ever had. And you've heard me say it before around Credit Karma, well, this is even a higher Net Promoter. And that contributed to a small amount this year because we were really being thoughtful and careful about ensuring we get to -- we have the right product market fit and we can deliver for customers. Well, we surprised ourselves in terms of the product market fit, and we're going to be really intentional about doubling down on that next year. I think I would say the other thing, back to your question around learning, is we really learned where and how experts. And remember, experts is not just human. It's both our AI and generative AI capabilities and/or humans depending on the need of the customer engaging around the money experience, helping customers understand their refund, changes in their refund or their balance due and changes in their balance due. We learned, coupled with our go-to-market strategy, how to really nail that benefit, and that's what drove the growth. But we believe we are capable of so much more growth as we look ahead based on the insights we got towards the end of the season, and that's what we'll be focused on as we head into next year. Operator : That's all the time we have today for questions. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Just to say thank you for all your great questions, and many thanks to our employees and customers for their amazing focus and being part of this storied franchise, and we look forward to seeing all of you at next earnings. Thank you, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Raiza. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I\u2019m here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi, and our new CFO, Sandeep Aujla. Welcome, Sandeep, it's nice to have you on the call. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022, and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : All right. Excellent, Kim, thank you, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We had a very strong fourth quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform, powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We grew full year revenue 13%, delivered strong operating margin expansion, and exited the year with momentum. Our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our platform and the diversity of our portfolio, including our ability to maintain earnings power in uncertain times. This past year, we expanded our operating margin again, while investing in the most important areas to drive durable long-term growth. We are guiding to another year of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion in fiscal year 2024, even with the macroeconomic environment that is uncertain. We are entering Intuit's most exciting area. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core fueling innovation across our five Big Bets. We've made strong progress in transforming from a tax and accounting platform where consumers and small businesses have to do the work to achieve the benefit that they are seeking, to a global financial platform, where we do the hard work for them. Now, we are creating a future of, done for you, a future where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers to fuel their financial success. This future is only possible because of our history of significant investments in our platform, talent, data and AI and now our accelerated investments in generative AI. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal, transactional and behavioral data for 100 million customers. For small businesses, we have a 360-degree view of their business and customers. We have 500,000 customers and financial attributes per small business on our platform and this data gives us insights into behaviors, income streams, expenses, profitability, and cash flows, enabling us to provide personalized experiences and recommendations to help them prosper. Additionally, we have 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform, including income, expenses, credit history, spending history, outstanding loans, cash flow, and tax information, which enables us to become a financial assistant in their pocket. We are using our data to fine-tune our own financial large language models that specialize in solving tax, accounting, cash flow, marketing, and personal finance challenges. The investments that we've made in data and AI over the years allow us to introduce innovations at an accelerated rate. Intuit's rich data platform is a powerful foundation that allows us to create innovative AI-assisted experiences for all of our customers powering their prosperity. In June, we introduced our generative AI operating system called GenOS, to ignite innovation at scale for the benefit of millions of consumers and small businesses. GenOS empowers Intuit technologists to create breakthrough generative AI experiences. We are using a platform approach, giving our teams across Intuit the resources and tools they need to design, build, test and deploy these new experiences with unparalleled speed. This includes our own powerful financial LLMs, as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers, in a cost-effective way. We are entering Intuit\u2019s most exciting era yet and believe the next several years will be game changing. On September 6th, we\u2019ll be hosting Intuit Innovation Day, a virtual event where we will unveil exciting GenAI innovation across our platform and how it will drive business growth in the years ahead. We look forward to sharing more with you then. Now, let me turn to our Big Bets which are driving growth and benefits for our customers today. I would like to highlight some examples of recent progress in one of our Big Bets. As a reminder, our five Big Bets are, revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth, by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continues to drive digitization, from creating an estimate, to invoicing a customer, to getting paid. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit, and getting paid upfront, are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, leading to 22% total online payment volume growth this quarter. We are making significant progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses, and ultimately improve their cash flow. We see a tremendous opportunity as 80% of businesses still pay other firms via paper checks. We recently expanded the availability of the beta of our native bill pay solution by 10x. Turning to Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end QuickBooks and Mailchimp customer growth platform. Second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and eCommerce suite. And third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This last quarter, we implemented our first generative AI capability in Mailchimp, the Email Content Generator, enabling customers to create faster email campaigns based on industry, marketing intent and brand voice. This quarter, we launched the beta of a new product announcement generator, which uses AI to automatically create an email that a small business can send to its customers. We also announced over 150 new and updated features at our recent Mailchimp conference in London, designed to support the needs of advanced marketers, including a calendar view, custom reporting and analytics, more e-commerce advanced segmentation, more real time behavioral data based on e-commerce automations, and SMS marketing. Lineup changes and free trials are driving positive trends in year-over-year paid customer growth, which accelerated this quarter. We continue to make progress in mid-market, our 90-day retention rate this quarter the highest it\u2019s been in two years. We have also translated the product into five different languages. We will share more on the outcomes we\u2019re delivering across our five Big Bets at our Investor Day. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our products, we are moving at high velocity. This will help us put more money in our customers\u2019 pockets, save them time, and ensure complete confidence in every financial decision they make. As we lead this next technological shift, we are well positioned to power prosperity for our customers and communities that we serve with a leadership team that is built for the era of AI. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep. It\u2019s great to have you on the call, my friend. Sandeep Aujla : Thank you, Sasan. I'm excited to be here and I look forward to meeting many of you in the future. We delivered strong results in fiscal 2023, including total revenue growth of 13%, strong margin expansion, and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% and 22% respectively. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we delivered results that exceeded the high-end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including revenue of $2.7 billion, up 12%. GAAP operating income of $17 million versus a loss of $75 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $627 million versus $433 million last year up 45%. GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $0.32 versus a loss of $0.20 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.65 versus $1.10 last year, up 50%. Now turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 21% during the quarter and 24% for the full year, which included four points of benefit from a full year of Mailchimp's revenue this year versus three quarters last year. Online ecosystem revenue grew 21% during the quarter and 30% for the full year. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold, grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 22% in Q4 and 26% in fiscal '23. Growth for the quarter and fiscal year were driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shifts. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services grew 20% in Q4 driven by payroll, Mailchimp, payments, capital and time tracking. For the full fiscal year, '23 QuickBooks Online Services grew 34% driven by Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in this quarter reflects an increase in customers' adopting our payroll solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. Mailchimp revenue grew mid-teens in Q4. Growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offering to manage their cash flow as well as an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q4 and 31% in fiscal '23. The power of our small business platform continues to resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow across all types of economic environments. Our platform remains critical to our customers' success and we continue to see them adopt multiple offerings across the platform to manage their business. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the low 20s. We are approximately two-thirds of the way through a three-year transition for customers that remained on license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. We also raised our desktop prices across multiple products last September, consistent with our principle to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem revenue growth next year as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. Our focus is to continue building out our online ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be our growth catalyst longer-term. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate Small Business and Self-Employed revenue growth of 15% to 20% per year in long term. Now shifting to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $424 million in Q4, down 11%. On a product basis, the decline in Q4 was driven primarily by macroeconomic headwinds in personal loans, auto insurance, home loans and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma Money. Full year revenue was $1.6 billion down 9%. Credit Karma represented 11% of Intuit's total revenue in fiscal '23. We have seen continued stability across our core verticals, which led to the improvement in year-over-year performance during Q4 versus Q3. For context, credit cards and personal loans represented nearly 50% and nearly 30% of Credit Karma\u2019s revenue in fiscal '23, respectively. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate Credit Karma annual revenue growth of 20% to 25% per year long term. Now shifting to Consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $4.1 billion in fiscal '23, up 6%. Each tax season has been unique since the pandemic began four years ago, introducing volatility into Consumer Group results. However, average annual trends over this four-year period are more in line with the long-term trends. Over the past four years, Consumer Group revenue increased by an average of 10% annually, which aligns with our long-term growth expectations of 8% to 12%. While this was a unique tax season, I am proud of the progress the team made by transforming the assisted segment with TurboTax Live, which grew revenues 17% this year, while customers grew 12%. Looking ahead, we are confident in multiple growth drivers. First, we see a large runway ahead of us with TurboTax Live, given our ability to use both GenAI and human experts powered by AI to deliver confidence for our customers. We are investing in scaling our full-service offering, which has a good product market fit based on the highest product recommendation scores of any product at Intuit this year. Second, we are trying to scale our business tax offering, following a successful pilot this year. And third, we see significant opportunities ahead, driving Credit Karma members to TurboTax and giving TurboTax filers faster access to their money with Credit Karma Money. Given the growth opportunities I just shared, we continue to expect annual Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% per year over the long term. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue was $561 million in fiscal '23, up 3%. Now let me share more on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions, remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in cash and investments and $6.1 billion in debt on our balance sheet. Approximately $4.2 billion of the debt is maturing over the next 15 months and we are evaluating refinancing opportunities subject to market and other conditions. We repurchased $465 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $2 billion during fiscal '23. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim to be -- is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share payable on October 17, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. We recently finalized our three and one year strategic plan. I feel confident in the investments we are making to drive durable growth, including executing across our Big Bet and continuing the accelerated pace of innovation, particularly with GenAI. We have a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. We manage for the short and the long-term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. Our fiscal 2024 guidance includes total company revenue of $15.89 billion to $16.105 billion, a growth of 11% to 12%. Our guidance includes revenue growth of 16% to 17% for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, 7% to 8% for the Consumer Group, and a decline of 3% to a growth of 3% for Credit Karma. GAAP earnings per share of $9.37 to $9.67, growth of 11% to 15%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $16.17 to $16.47 growth of 12% to 14%. We expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% in fiscal 2024. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '24 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.15 to $0.21, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.94 to $2. We are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '24, we expect to pay approximately $700 million in cash tax payments related to fiscal '23, which were deferred due to the IRS disaster-area tax relief. You can find a full fiscal 2024 and Q1 guidance details in our press release as well as on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you. And wrapping up, we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress with our five Big Bets, the investments that we are making in GenAI and our leadership team driving our platform innovation. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. In today's uncertain macro-environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and mission-critical than ever to our customers. I look forward to your attendance at our Intuit Innovation Day on September 6th, and Investor Day on September 28th. With that, let's open it up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and a really nice quarter, and nice to see a forward EPS guide ahead kind of where consensus was to see those numbers start moving up. My inbox getting filled up with questions about the consumer business and the consumer guide. You've talked about a longer-term 8% to 12% growth there, the four-year CAGR of 10%, but this year you are looking for 7% to 8%, so below that guidance framework. And I think what people are trying to understand is why that is? Last year was a difficult tax season. Did you pull the levers too hard on pricing? Or what was it, do we need to refill the tank in terms of units like? What is it that's going to keep this tax season to be underperforming those longer-term targets? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Hey, Keith, thank you for your question. Let me give you the headline, but allow me to unpack it. I think the headline is we are just simply being prudent. Our focus on future growth and our bullishness does not change at all. Let me unpack that. First and foremost, when you look at the assisted segment, there is a $30 billion TAM, and $20 billion of it is consumer-assisted segment and $10 billion of it is business segment. And the second is the secular shift towards digitization will continue and only accelerate in the years to come. And with that as context, we probably saw some of our biggest green shoots this year, which is why we are probably more bullish about what's possible in this business than we were even three to four years ago, and I would put it in two buckets, Credit Karma and then the assisted segment. In Credit Karma, just as a reminder, our vision from the moment that we bought Credit Karma was to create one consumer platform where a consumer can manage their financial lives, manage their money, and get their taxes done in one place. After several years of just rapid experimentation, we had a massive breakthrough this past year where our customer growth within the Credit Karma platform versus a number of Credit Karma members who became TurboTax customers was up 5x and we are scaling that both on the product side and on the business model side as that gives us a lot of confidence going into next year and beyond. The second is going to be assisted segment and that's in three parts. First and foremost is we actually had product market fit this past year at full service, our biggest focus was how do we scale. We had some breakthroughs in how to scale. In fact, as you heard from Sandeep, we had our best product recommendations score of any product across the company and we are significantly leaning into that in the coming year. The second is business tax. We launched and learned to get the product market fit in business tax. That is not going to be available, both across our QuickBooks Live platform and directly going to market with TurboTax and we have hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, will come to TurboTax looking for business tax. We've never had an offering. We will next year and we are scaling it. The last thing, I would say in the assisted segment, one of the biggest things that we've learned in the last year is local matters. What that means, people will go on Google, and they will search, if I'm in San Diego is there a pro close to me, while we've never been good been found and local and in fact, when you look at the experts that we have, we are 10 miles from every home in household in the United States and so we're going big on local this year. And so when I look at our green shoots in the assisted segment and in Credit Karma, it gives us a lot of confidence as we look at this coming year and the future and I'll end with where I started, was the essence of your question about our guidance, we're simply being prudent given the year that we just had. Keith Weiss : Excellent. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Great quarter and Sandeep, congratulations on your first earnings call and looking forward to working with you. Sasan, I want to ask about your bill pay, what sort of feedback have you been getting from your beta customer from the QuickBooks native bill pay? And how should we think about the near-term opportunity as you're switching the legacy powered by payment solution with now your native bill pay? And then on the broader vision side on small business, now that you have full end-to-end cash flow management, now you have AR invoice payment and AP bill pay, then you have money bank accounts. So what is your broader vision in terms of that monetizing the whole ecosystem? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Siti, thank you for your question. Let me take it in two parts. First and foremost, you've heard us in the past year plus talk about digitizing B2B with respect to all of the manual work that gets done today in terms of 80% of the back and forth between small businesses is all sort of paper checks and manual. And our goal has been to digitize all of that. And one last element of what we needed to do was to launch bill pay. I think the headline I would just give is -- the feedback we've been getting has even gone better than what we thought, and we're now at a place where we are 10x-ing our beta, and we hope to have it available to all of our customers soon. So we feel very good about what we are seeing in Bill Pay and how fast we're able to build it based on the platform capabilities that we have and the feedback that we've gotten from customers. I think back to your second question, you're right. And in fact, the vision I would take you back to is that we have set out to be the source of truth for a business and to truly be the center of small business growth. And in order to do that, we have to have capabilities that not only help a small business grow their customers, retain their customers, market to their customers, but to be able to manage their cash flow and be able to manage their employees. We now have all of those capabilities end-to-end. And I think particularly, what's important, that advantages us to deliver for our customers is the data and our AI investments that we've made in the last five-plus years. And I think I would just encourage you to attend -- and if you can attend when it's on real time, watch the replay of our September 6 Intuit Innovation Day. And you will see how with our data, AI and GenAI capabilities we help customers manage their cash flow and really digitize all of money movement in a way that's so intuitive, so easy and delivered at a moment of truth. So we're quite excited about what's possible as we look at this coming year, about the years ahead. And let me, by the way, be very explicit that none of our potential innovation that you're going to experience in September 6 around GenAI is included in our guidance. But we believe it is fundamentally revolutionary as we think about the world we're going to create in the future. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Sasan, when you mentioned prudent in the tax guide. I'm curious, are you baking in more wiggle room this year than in past years in the guidance or can you just walk through what you mean by prudent? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Great question. Well, first of all, I'll just take you back to what you already know, but I think it's important that we start there. This past year, IRS returns, we continue to estimate we'll be down a couple of points. The do-it-yourself category will be down nearly 1 point. And the driver of that, which we are now certain of, based on all the working analysis that we've done, is we had a number of folks that came in to get their stimulus dollars and tax credits, and so it was pandemic driven. And so that created just what you heard from Sandeep, a sort of a very unusual tax season. But then when you step back and look at the last four-year trend, it sort of straightened out. And so what we mean by prudent is really a couple of things. One, we're not assuming IRS growth in our numbers this year, and we're not banking on all of the innovation that I just shared paying off this coming year. And that's just part of us being prudent because we want to demonstrate to all of you that this is a business that grows 8% to 12%. And by doing so, we must deliver the results. And so it's just being very intentional and very prudent. As we think about, by the way, our guidance holistically, it's not just TurboTax, it's TurboTax, it's Credit Karma and the way we thought about Small Business. But those are -- that's the sort of the definition of what we mean by prudent. Brent Thill : Thank you, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Michael Turrin : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. You delivered outsized margin expansion this past year. You've mentioned a focus on cost controls, given the tougher environment throughout the year, realize it's one of the guiding principles, but maybe, Sandeep, if you can just speak to what's allowing you to guide for continued margin expansion as a starting point here? And maybe how we should think about what's allowing for continued margin expansion as you break into the upper 30s there on the operating margin side? Thanks. Sandeep Aujla : Thanks for the question, Michael. And let me unpack it a little bit. We go through a [indiscernible] planning process, as I shared in the prepared remarks. And due that process, if you look at one of the biggest needle movers to deliver growth both in the near term and the long term, so durable growth levers for the company. And we make sure those are funded for success, inclusive of Big Bets and investments in GenAI. So the 40 to 60 bps of guidance reflects those investments and, quite frankly, reflects the strength and resilience of our platform. As a reminder, this is an expansion we're delivering on top of the 3.5 points of expansion we delivered over the last three years. As I look ahead, I see plenty of runway for us to continue to operate in accordance with our financial principles to grow expenses slower than revenue, therefore, implying a margin expansion. And really, as I look at it, what gives me confidence is that we are an AI-driven expert platform, and we operate as an ecosystem across technology, across customer success, across marketing. So in addition to giving us a competitive advantage for having faster time to market as a -- from opting as an ecosystem, it also gives us advantage in getting operating leverage as we scale as a business. Michael Turrin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Your line is open. Taylor McGinnis : Yeah. Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe I'll focus on the Small Business and Self-Employed full year guide, which was really strong. So I know there's a bunch of moving pieces in there between customer ads, mix shift, online services attach and price. But are you able to help us understand how each of those levers are contributing to the guide? And based on what you're seeing in the environment, what's giving you comfort and the durability of those growth drivers? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you for your questions. Let me start us off and Sandeep, please jump in if you want to add anything. First of all, we have a framework at the company level where we want to drive the majority of our growth from volume and mix and the lesser part from price, but we always focus on pricing for value. And so when we look at our growth drivers this year, it is coming from customer growth, and it is coming from mix and to a lesser extent this year compared to last year, by the way, from price. With that as context, I would just remind you that the big picture, when you look at our opportunity this coming year, but even in the next three to five years plus, we now have a platform and a portfolio of services where we have the opportunity to drive further adoption of our services from Mailchimp to payments, to payroll to time tracking and to a lot of our new innovations around Bill Pay and digitizing B2B that I just mentioned. But also, although we are three to four years in, we're just at the beginning of what's possible in the midmarket. Big market is a significant ARPC opportunity because these customers use a lot of the capabilities that I just mentioned, except they pay a lot more. And we're just at the beginning of the flywheel of penetrating mid-market. So when you look at the portfolio of the services that we have, the strength of the experience that we're delivering because of data and AI and because of mid-market, it allows us to drive most of our growth from customer growth and mix. And none of that, by the way, takes into account what's possible as we look into the future with our generative AI experiences that you'll be able to observe on September 6. But those are the main drivers. Sandeep Aujla : And Taylor, I would add, over the long term, we remain committed to our growth algorithm of 10% to 20% ARPC and customer growth. That remains unchanged. And really, as Sasan mentioned, is our innovation across our platform that gives us -- opens up the aperture for us to cross-sell and upsell our customers across more offerings on our platform as those opportunities for us to price for value as we look ahead. Taylor McGinnis : Great. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Kim Watkins : Raiza, we\u2019re ready for our next question. Operator : And our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi. Thank you very much. I hope you can hear me okay. So the recession that everybody's been expecting, it doesn't seem to be quite happening. Sasan, I know you've got a great read on your SMB ecosystem. What are some of the indicators that you're seeing? And if you've already proactively addressed this, my apologies for bringing it up again. But what are some of the forward-looking indicators that you see in the Credit Karma business or the SMB ecosystem that give you renewed confidence that we are going to be okay? Because your fiscal '24 guidance definitely is not reflecting of any caution in the environment, but more like a continuation of what we've seen in the last four quarters. Just some thoughts there would be great. Thank you so much and congrats. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, sure. Thank you for your question. And you're loud and clear, my friend. So let me start with Small Business. And generally, I would just lead with they continue to be healthy, but they're challenged in this environment. The specifics that I would share is the cash flow -- cash reserves of Small Businesses is 90% of what it was this time last year. However, it is still stronger than pre-pandemic. The -- in terms of looking for labor and finding employees to drive their growth, that's still quite strong. And in fact, in this environment, Small Businesses are able to do a better job finding what they need versus when the market was hot, which is good for them because then they can deliver for their customers and drive growth. And the last thing I would just say is there are certain sectors that are very weak, transportation, real estate, advertising, is very weak within small businesses. So that's the aggregate picture. I'll end with what where I started, struggling, but still healthy compared to pre-pandemic. On the consumer side, let me hit on sort of two different points. I'll quickly hit on Credit Karma. As you know, Sandeep mentioned, what we're seeing is stability and our innovation that we've been focused on is really getting hold, and there's some exciting things that we're working on in Credit Karma that we'll share both on September 6 and at Investor Day, one where we redesigned the entire app. And we have begun to roll it out to a small cohort of customers and will eventually scale it. And we're actually seeing very good engagement with the redesigned app. And then that, coupled with our GenAI experiences, along with all of our innovation with Lightbox and Credit Karma Money gives us a lot of excitement around the future, none of which, by the way, is in our guidance. But the headline is stability in Credit Karma and lots of innovation that is helping us with where we are and coming. If I just focus on the consumer, a couple of things I would say. If you look back to last March of 2022, credit scores are, on average, down 13 points. Credit balances are up about 30%. And the credit band of like [600 to 660] (ph) have the largest balances. They're carrying about $10,000 on average. And the Gen Z balances have gone up the most, are up 45% year-over-year. So job market is still good. People still have jobs, but there's certainly some level of strain on the consumer. Kash Rangan : Brilliant. Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Sasan, following up on that Credit Karma commentary. Obviously, the world we live in today is different than when you acquired the business. Do you think the long-term growth rate of Credit Karma is meaningfully different in a world where interest rates are mid-single digits versus zero? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Brad, thank you for your question. The short answer is no. We're very bullish on the business. And in fact, a couple of things that I would share with you, which we can talk more about at Investor Day, but just not to leave you hanging, the monetization model in Credit Karma is how many members you have, how frequently they engage. And there's a model for -- every time a customer engages, there is a average revenue per customer that we benefit from. And in fact, this past year, in '23, when our results were down year-over-year, our frequency of engagement is actually higher than the prior two years where we had 37% growth and 58% growth. Now why is that? It's because of all of our innovation. It's because the customer is engaging but in many areas, credit is still tight. So when credit begins to open up, and that's the stability that we're seeing now, we view this business will accelerate back to the 20% to 25% growth rate. Plus I'll remind you that, that plus the integration with TurboTax drives actually more stickiness, more monetization and truly created this one consumer platform, which was our vision from day one when we acquired Credit Karma. And with all of the data and AI capabilities that we have in our accelerated GenAI experiences, as I said earlier, you're going to see on September 6, some of the new innovations that are coming that will make it easier for customers to find what they need, the benefits that they need to engage in the financial products that they want and manage their money. And so all of that leads to our view is completely unchanged relative to the long-term expectations of 20% to 25% growth in Credit Karma. Sandeep Aujla : And Brad, the one thing I would add to this because you asked about a scenario in which interest rates are higher. When interest rates are higher, the consumer have a higher propensity to shop around because even a small improvement in the rates that they're getting, has a bigger difference in terms of the interest rate they're paying and a bigger difference to their bottom line. So in fact, the product becomes more important critical to the end user in a higher rate environment. Brad Reback : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Good evening, Sasan. This year, you're really focused, at least from a TV advertising standpoint on full service, really trying to get the message out. And I'm wondering, one of the things you talked about is being a little bit more prudent on revenue growth on the consumer business. I'm wondering are -- will your strategy change at all and how you're marketing the full-service product? And how did the full-service product perform compared to your expectations this quarter as well -- this year as well? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Great question. Let me give you an answer that I think you'll find somewhat helpful and somewhat vague intentionally. We learned a lot this year. We came into the year with a full service offering that has product markets, that as you know, it's all AI-driven. And we can virtually get things done within an hour or same day. We learned a lot around health and scaling and how to have customers find our full-service offering. And a lot of it also has to do with what I mentioned earlier, which is local marketing. If I'm in San Diego, if I'm in Kansas City, even if I see that TurboTax can provide experts, I go to start to see locally if there's somebody there. Well, all of our experts that we have are within 10 miles of many of the households in the United States, but we've never marketed that way. And so that's going to inform our marketing going forward. So there's a lot that we learned in terms of how to evolve our marketing, so it becomes an and, and not an either/or, and we're excited about it. Kartik Mehta : Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Very welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Yeah. Thanks very much. Sasan, I'd love to hear you just give a little bit more detail on what you're counting on Mailchimp to do this year and maybe not if you don't want to get too much into the quantitative side. Qualitatively, you guys have done a lot of work around the product, the monetizaiton. How important is sort of a continued acceleration of Mailchimp as you look at sort of the small business in aggregate for next year? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Kirk, thank you for your question. It's really -- to answer your question, it's really threefold. First and foremost, as you know, we made this acquisition ultimately to create one growth platform, so we can help a small business in one place, be able to grow their business and manage their cash flow and manage their workforce all in one place. And really the key to all of this has been data, AI and now our accelerated investments in GenAI. And so first and foremost is we want to make significant progress in this area, and you'll actually see some of this on both September 6, our Intuit Innovation Day and at Investor Day. That's number one. The second is, as I mentioned earlier, we had the largest release in June that we've ever had in Mailchimp's history. We had 150 new and updated features that we released on top of the multiple GenAI-driven announcements that we had made a couple of weeks prior to that. So our second focus is adoption, getting our customers to adopt these benefits because not only will it help fuel their success, but it will help us with monetization, particularly in the mid-market, which is where our focus is very similar to the focus that we've had with QuickBooks' mid-market. And then third is international. Mailchimp is the lead horse internationally. And we've done a lot to localize the product. I mentioned earlier in the five languages and more is coming. We've also been doing a lot of price studies and price testing because we've had like one class price internationally. That doesn't work. Some countries should be higher, some countries should be lower. And so we've learned a lot in terms of some of our testing and many of that we're going to be scaling this year. So those are -- if I were to just sort of carve out your question, those are the three big areas that we are very focused on in the coming years. Kirk Materne : Great. Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nick Giovacchini : Hi, everyone. It\u2019s Nick Giovacchini on for Brad this evening. Congratulations on the strong end to the year, and welcome, Sandeep. I appreciate you taking the question. International growth has decelerated since the beginning of the year. Can you talk us through how you see that growing going forward? Thanks. Sandeep Aujla : Thanks for the question, Nick. A couple of things on the international growth. On international growth, as I shared earlier, our focus, our refreshed strategy is to lead with both Mailchimp and QuickBooks in the markets where we have product market fit. And in other areas to lead with Mailchimp at the tip of the spear. Our growth decelerated for a couple of reasons, and some of that Sasan shared. As we lead into rightsizing the pricing for Mailchimp in some of these geographies, historically, it was the same price. It was basically the price in the US simply converting into the local currency and applied in that geography. We went in, and we looked at what the price should be based on the competitors in the market, based on the GDP per capital and all these other factors and we rightsized the price. Secondly, as we do in QuickBooks, we introduced free trials or discounts initially when folks join the product is what we have experienced over our years of doing that is people -- more people come into the product and they stick around. That leads to a better 90-day forwarded retention, et cetera. These are all the factors and all the improvements we're making in the Mailchimp product and the lineup, which is leading to what I would describe as a temporary headwind in terms of our international growth. Nick Giovacchini : Great. Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on a really nice and prudent guidance methodology for next year. I guess maybe I'll just -- I want both of my questions to really target the SMB growth rate. It seems like the guide there ex Mailchimp is really strong. Sandeep you're now in the CFO seat, maybe just talk about -- you talked about the prudence intact, but the prudence in the SMB guide, what gives you guys the confidence to kind of guide that way? How much of it has to do with some of the payment functionalities that are coming to market, some of the GenAI functionality that's coming to market, what gives you guys that guidance? And then dovetailing into that, new leadership for that group, obviously, as well. Is there talk about the potential for either disruption or how is that accounted for? Or why Mariana was the right fit for that role specifically and kind of where -- what you're going to bring to the table in? Sasan Goodarzi : Alex, can I take the leadership question and take it more broadly and then let Sandeep jump in and answer specifically your question around the guide. Let me take this opportunity to talk about the leadership changes that we've had in the company. And I'll, of course, include Mariana in that as well. First of all, one of our greatest superpowers as a company is leadership development and succession planning. One of the focus areas that we have as part of our Intuit operating system, which starts at the top with my staff and staff is we spend four times a year, several days at a time, focusing on talent, focusing on succession planning, reviewing development plans and being very intentional about architecting mobility moves. And ultimately, our goal is to be 3D in all of our key roles at multiple levels in the company, which, by the way, is very hard to do. But that is why we are a leadership factory. The second thing I would say is that we are very focused on mobility of senior roles, so the Vice President and above, which is an officer of the company and above, typically within a three- to five-year period, there's a lot of it -- you don't have visibility to, of course, because you only see potential changes that happen in my staff. But we're very intentional about mobility because we believe fresh perspective, fresh thinking is important in our technology areas and our businesses and also training the leaders to be ready for a bigger job is very important. By the way, I'll use myself as an example. Before I stepped into the CEO job 4.5 years ago, I was in TurboTax for three years. I was in QuickBook -- running Small Business for three years when I was the CIO for two years. So that's just an example of mobility. With all of that said, sometimes our mobility is up and to the right and changes within the company. Sometimes we celebrate folks taking on roles outside of the company because that may be the best fit for them. So with that as context, we have a lot of confidence in our leaders, and let me now specifically touch on our three of the leaders just to make it very real. When you look at Mariana, I actually hired Mariana into Small Business when I was there. She was our Chief Product Development Officer and is very familiar with Small Business. When I became the CEO, I moved her into the CEO role, and she's done an unbelievable job fueling innovation across the company. And now she's going back home to where she started running Small Business. And very excited about what she will do to unlock the next year of growth. When you look at Mark in TurboTax, I actually started with Mark in TurboTax a decade ago. and worked with him for three years. We then -- after I left TurboTax a few years later, promoted him to be our Chief Customer Success Officer of the company. And he is the godfather of our live platform that we talk a lot about today. And now he's going back home and running TurboTax. So he's very well versed not only in the business, but our disruptive growth driver of the future, which is live. And then Alex Balazs, just upon our CTO role, I also worked with him in TurboTax. We then move them to a broader Chief Architect and data role, where he's been Mariana's right-hand person, fueling the innovation across the company. We just moved him into the CTO role. The reason I wanted to go through that a bit fairly is for all of you to understand that succession planning and leadership development is our sort of core competency. And I actually believe that we have the strongest team that we've had ever built for the era of AI given their backgrounds and experiences. So with that as context, let me have Sandeep answer the other part of your question, Alex. Sandeep Aujla : Absolutely. And actually, let me touch on one additional point to what Sasan added, it's never about one individual. We are a system, and we have strong leadership teams around our General Manager and CFO staff as well. So getting back to your question on the guidance, Alex. So just for context, the Small Business group grew 24% in fiscal '23, with four of those points coming from the benefit of the timing of the Mailchimp acquisition. So that's about a 20% organic run rate. And as we have shared with you with -- the group in the past is 80% of the revenues in the Small Business group are subscription-based. So that makes -- so the recurring nature of the revenue makes it highly predictable. And we -- this year's strong results in areas where we are focused, such as QuickBooks Advanced customer growth as well as in the mid-market area that Sasan touched on. So that is one component giving us confidence as we guide for next year. The second aspect is it's the importance of our products to SMBs. This is something core to how they run their business, how they pay their employees, how they get paid themselves, how they get access to capital to take on new projects and grow their business. And we have made tremendous improvements in our product in an ecosystem that makes that platform that much more relevant and important to the lives of our customers. So that is what's all baked into the guidance that we provided for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. You asked a question if we were reliant on GenAI. I want to reiterate and be very clear. GenAI, we believe it will be an accelerator for our business, but that is not baked into the guidance that we shared with you all today. Alex Zukin : Super clear. Thanks a lot, Sandeep and Sasan. It was very in-depth explanation. No doubt the talent factory is alive and well. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Alex. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for Mark Murphy. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig in on Credit Karma, specifically as it relates to the opportunity to begin to pursue prime customers in addition to the subprime and near-prime customers you guys have kind of focused on historically? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you for your question. Yes, it's a big focus area for us going after prime customers. And just for context, it's sort of a third of our monthly active users, and they're the least engaged because really, when you look at the platform, we traditionally focused on subprime and near prime. And we have a lot of the capabilities that we've developed in the past and know these prime customers very well, which is why we have merged our Mint and Credit Karma team and platform to really solve for these prime customers. And so we have been working, I think, for the last almost a year, really understanding their needs, running a number of experiments and are now -- and has been in the midst of launching multiple things that are very geared towards prime customers. And we're actually very excited with the app redesign. There's sort of two big things that we've been working on in Credit Karma beyond what we've been sharing with you. One is really redesigning the whole app to enable customers and certain cohort of customers like Prime to be able to find the benefit that they're looking for because of everything that we know about them proactively. The second is the GenAI experience is that, again, we will unveil more of September 6. And the combination of those two things and what I shared a moment ago around Prime customers gives us a lot of sort of excitement around what's possible to serve these Prime customers going forward, which is something that we've not benefited from a monetization perspective. None of that is included in our guidance, but it's something that we're very excited about. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for the insight. Looking forward to learning more about it. Sasan Goodarzi : Yep. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask one on AI here as well. It sounds like some exciting things coming, looking forward to learning more about that. A lot of possibilities here within Small Business and Consumer. Would just love to get your perspective on kind of where you're coming from? Sasan, you've alluded to the fact that Intuit is well prepared here because of the platform capabilities here and the underpinnings of that with data. So just curious, any color as to where Intuit is coming from such that you're able to iterate on AI the way that we're looking forward to learning more about. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you for your question. I'll start with taking you back to five years ago when we declared our strategy was to really shift the company from just a tax and accounting platform, which is a very important set of problems to solve for customers to a global financial platform that really played a far more meaningful role in powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses on a daily basis. When we made that strategic declaration on the five bets that ensued, what we talked about at that time was that data and AI was going to be core to making that shift. And in fact, when we made the acquisition of both Credit Karma and Mailchimp, one huge driver of the acquisition was around the data, because in essence, we will know a lot more about customers, and we could leverage that data for their benefit to fuel their success. So -- and even five years ago declaring this, data and machine learning has been a decade-long focus of Intuit. So when you think about a decade-long investment in data usable data, cleaning the data and making sure that it's structured in a way where it can be used and then our investments in AI, specifically in knowledge engineering, which really takes rules and the relationship between data and turns it in the code is what our advantages in TurboTax, machine learning and natural language processing, those have been -- it's been a decade-long set of investments and the two acquisitions have propelled us forward about 10 years. And then you couple that with what we started several years ago, which is GenAI. And then what we launched in June, which is Generative Operating System, GenOS, which by the way, is not something you can create overnight. This is years of investment. When we couple those kind of investments, data, AI and GenOS, which is really primarily our own Intuit financial large language models that are trained on our customers' proprietary data, it allows us to personalize things, humanize things and do the work for customers in a way that's revolutionary, which ultimately gets to the punch line of we are creating a future that is done for you. Rather than you having to do the work to run your business, rather than you have to do the work to be able to power your prosperity, manage your finances as a consumer, we want to put you in control where it's done for you. You're always in control, you have the taste of whether or not you move forward with a decision. But we want to be able to help you grow your customers and run your business for you and help you manage your cash flow, always put the right choices in front of you. And the same thing goes on the tax side and Credit Karma side. So that's what's so exciting about -- it's a decade-long focus. We really tripled down on it five years ago when we declared our strategy. And we're -- we have now galvanized and energized the entire company that the [future of done for you] (ph) that we declared five years ago is very real, very much here. And we had an enormous opportunity to do amazing things for our customers. And that's what really gets us excited about what's possible. And so I can do another advertisement, join us September 6 for Intuit's Innovation Day, followed by Investor Day, and you'll get a real good feel for the world that we are going to create for the future. Brad Sills : Looking forward to it. Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We'll take our last question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Welcome Sandeep. And good afternoon, Sasan. The -- I have a couple on consumer, one very high level and one, just a clarification. So the first is on... Sasan Goodarzi : Scott, you cut out on us. Kim Watkins : Raiza, can you try to bring him back? Operator : Thanks, Scott. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Sasan, can you hear me? Sasan Goodarzi : We can now. Yes, if you don't mind start over again, we lost you. Scott Schneeberger : Absolutely. Thanks. So two quick on consumer. First, volume and price mix. Just your consideration of that going into fiscal 2024 and beyond given the trends of the recent years? And then for you or Sandeep, just curious in the extension season in the post-tax season, what did you see? Anything interesting with California? Should we see a shift from fiscal '23 to '24 that's material related to anything extension wise? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Let me start with your volume mix question around TurboTax. I would say the way to think about it was what I described earlier, leaning into full service, leaning into business tax and continue to lean into TurboTax Live, which really comes with assistance, recognizing it's all data and AI driven. You're going to see more come from ARPC than volume, and that's just the nature of the opportunity. Now there is 88 million-plus people that are in the assisted segment and there's $30 billion of spend. So there's both a volume opportunity and an ARPC opportunity. Just our view, looking at the next 10 years, by the way, this is not a one-year answer, both matter, you're going to get -- we're going to get more from ARPC. And I'll let Sandeep jump in here as well. I mean on the extension season, that's just been very weird with many states that got extended to July and California to October and what we're seeing from customers is they're even gotten confused which month they have to file in their state. So net-net is there's more to file. When you look at it at the company level, it's really not material, but not everybody has filed yet. Sandeep Aujla : And that\u2019s -- that's basically the answer, Scott. It's not material for our Q1. It's been a unique behavior on the taxpayer. But I'll also remind us that last year, we also saw a great deal of extensions by taxpayers. So that's also something to keep in mind as you look at Q1. Scott Schneeberger : Thank you, both. Sasan Goodarzi : All right, everybody. I think that brings our questions or Q&A to an end. So thank you for your wonderful questions. Thank you for spending the time with us. We look forward to seeing you September 6 and -- at our Investor Day. Take good care. Be safe. Bye, everybody. Sandeep Aujla : Thank you, all. Kim Watkins : Goodbye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.",

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Chelsea. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's first quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi, and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2023, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I will turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong first quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform across the company. Total revenue grew 15%, driven by Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 18% and Consumer Group revenue growth of 25%. This was partially offset by Credit Karma revenue decline of 5%, in line with our expectations for Q1 given the macroeconomic environment. With the strong start to the year, we are reiterating our full year guidance for fiscal year 2024. Consumer Group revenue growth reflects a strong finish to the tax extension season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted consumer and business tax categories with TurboTax Live. Our innovation in tax has accelerated in several areas. First, the Credit Karma platform is leveraging data and AI to deliver personalized experiences and compelling tax offers. Second, is the innovation with TurboTax Live to deliver speed and confidence to prior year assisted customers, particularly with full service, where we can get taxes done in as little as an hour using data, AI and our expert platform at scale. And third, Intuit Assist, our GenAI-powered financial assistance, helping customers in key areas where confidence matters most. For example, understanding their refund or getting answers to their questions as if they're talking to an expert. We ran many experiments during the extension season, and the learnings give us confidence in our game plan to win this tax season. We believe this is Intuit's most exciting era yet. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core to fueling innovation across our platform. We're delivering experiences where the hard work is done for you with a gateway to human expertise, powering our customers' prosperity and accelerating penetration of our $300 billion in TAM. The launch of Intuit Assist is the result of years of investment in data and AI. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal, transactional and behavioral data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform. And with our GenAI operating system, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough AI experiences across the platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLM as well as those from other leaders in GenAI which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost-efficient way. We are creating a future of done for you, a future where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. Intuit Assist powered by GenAI is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade. Let me share a few updates on Intuit Assist across our offerings. First, Mailchimp. We're rolling out two new GenAI experiences, designed to help our customers grow their revenue and save time. These include AI-driven audience segmentation and marketing automation. I'll share more on those in just a moment. Second, TurboTax. As I shared earlier during the extension season we tested new GenAI experiences to deliver higher confidence for our DIY customers. This includes in-topic accuracy checks and personalized explanations throughout the filing process that help explain a customer's tax outcome. We're excited about rolling out these experiences this season. Third, QuickBooks. We are testing GenAI to help customers save time and run their business with complete confidence, including a digital expert that can surface business insights and allow customers to dig deeper or connect them to a human expert. For example, we're serving our proactive business insights to customers with an actionable business summary. These customers are using the business summary as a launching point to learn, create reports directly using Intuit Assist and take actions to drive their business success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months and in the future, we plan to automate these actions and do the work for our customers. Fourth, Credit Karma. We're testing GenAI to help our customers find the products that are right for them in a highly personalized way. For example, based on our research, prime members spend an average of five hours online comparing credit card benefits. With our members' credit data and spending history from accounts they choose to link to Credit Karma, we can use GenAI to help members select the right credit card for them optimized based on their personal spending history. This is designed to increase engagement with our members and help them improve their financial health and drive financial success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months. We are excited by Intuit Assist's early progress. It will change our relationship with customers as we move from a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that our customers rely on daily to power their prosperity. We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform. Let me now highlight progress across two of our five big bets. As a reminder, our five big bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continues to drive digitization from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer to getting paid to paying a supplier. Today, easier discovery, auto-enable payments, instant deposit and get paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering. Total online payment volume growth was strong in the quarter at 21%. We're also making good progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improving their cash flow. We made our bill pay offering widely available to customers during the quarter. While it's early, we are seeing mid-market customers choosing the paid subscription offering at approximately 2x the rate of non mid-market customers, indicating this paid offering is resonating with larger customers. Turning to Mailchimp. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. As I shared earlier, we're rolling out several features powered by Intuit Assist in time for peak holiday season for many of our customers. Let me highlight two of these impactful benefits designed to help our customers grow their revenue while saving time. First, AI-driven audience segmentation, which allows small businesses to target specific audiences. Many customers don't use audience segmentation today despite the fact that it can drive up to 60% lift in average order revenue or average order value over 12 months. With Intuit Assist, a customer can use conversational language to more quickly build segments and use them as a part of a marketing campaign. Second, AI-powered marketing automation, which are automated workflows that help small businesses reach their customers in uniquely tailored way. Today, many of our customers don't use marketing automation because they are time consuming the setup even though they can help them drive higher revenue. With Intuit Assist, Mailchimp creates marketing automation, which can easily be turned on and e-mail content can be generated and edited. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, 800,000 of which are already in our franchise, but using a core QBO or desktop product. Online mid-market customer and revenue growth remained strong and we are driving increased adoption of QuickBooks Advanced, payments and payroll, resulting in ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers with a full ecosystem of services. We are proud of our innovation and the impact that we're making on our customers' lives. We also continue to make an impact on the communities that we serve. This quarter, we launched Intuit for education, a new financial literacy program to provide Gen Z and Gen Alpha students access to Intuit products and teach some personal and small business finance skills. We also announced the first set of winners of our Coalfield Solar Fund, providing grants in [Seven-Eye] (ph) solar energy projects in coal mining communities to help build a sustainable future. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our platform, we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We are also delighted to be one of the only eight Fortune 500 companies named to Fortune's inaugural top 50 AI Innovators list. With that, let me now hand it over to Sandeep. Sandeep Aujla : Thank you, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered very strong results that exceeded the high end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including revenue of $3 billion, up 15%. GAAP operating income of $307 million versus $76 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $960 million versus $662 million last year, up 45%, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 versus $0.14 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.47 versus $1.66 last year, up 49%. I am pleased with our early momentum this fiscal year. Turning to the business segment. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem, which grew 20%. Our results demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which continue to resonate with customers as they look to grow their businesses and improve cash flow in any economic environment. with the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within a Small Business and Self-employed group is threefold, grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online\u2019s accounting revenue grew 19% in Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 20% in Q1, driven primarily by Payroll, Mailchimp, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting the payroll solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. In Mailchimp, revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth. And within Payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow as well as an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing a refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in established markets, and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on a localized product and lineup approach. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16%. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 14% in the first quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the high single digits. We are more than two-thirds of the way through a three-year transition for customers that remain on our license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. In conjunction with our business model transition, we also raised prices across multiple desktop products in October, consistent with our principle to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem to revenue growth this year as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. Our focus is to continue innovating across our online ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be a growth catalyst longer term. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $405 million in Q1, down 5% year-over-year. We saw partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards during Q1. We -- This performance was consistent with our expectations and a prudent approach to guidance given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. On a product basis, the decline in Q1 was driven primarily by macroeconomic trends across personal loan, auto insurance, home loans and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma money. Shifting to the consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $187 million and grew 25% in the quarter and ProTax revenue was $42 million and grew 24%. During the quarter, we saw stronger-than-expected TurboTax return volume from states, both with and without extended tax deadlines and strong performance in share of total returns during extension season. As Sasan shared earlier, we are excited about our innovation across TurboTax. The multiple experiments we ran during the extension season, bolster our confidence in our game plan to win this coming tax season. Now let me briefly touch on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions that remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments and $5.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet. In September, we raised $4 billion in secured -- sorry, in senior notes to repay the outstanding balance on an unsecured term loan. These notes carry a weighted average coupon of 5.29%, approximately 1 point lower than the term loan rate at the end of Q4. As a reminder, during Q1, we made tax payments of approximately $710 million that were deferred from fiscal 2023 due to the IRS disaster area tax relief. We also repurchased $603 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. And lastly, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on January 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I stated earlier, I'm pleased with the early momentum we're seeing in fiscal 2024, highlighting the strength of our platform within the uncertain macroeconomic environment that is consistent with our expectations. We have a proven playbook and a track record of managing for the short and the long term, including controlling discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in an even greater position of strength. Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%, GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 11% to 12%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.68 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.31. As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full fiscal 2024 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : All right. Well, thank you, Sandeep. And to wrap it up, we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress across our five big bets and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe this will change our relationship with customers, becoming their trusted adviser, leading to higher engagement and monetization. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate at penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. With all of that said, let's now open it up to your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Sasan, on the AI strategy, like obviously, you have like one -- it seems like one big platform that is driving it. Like can you -- what's the kind of opportunity to kind of learn from one segment and use it in the other segment? And as part of that also, like are you impacted by the chip shortage? Will that kind of impact the rollout for you? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you for your question. And I actually think it's a really interesting question that you're asking in terms of how are we learning across platforms. The short answer is we capture best practices and share the insights on a daily basis across our teams. And in fact, I'll just use our staff as an example. We get weekly slacks with documents that share the best practices, the progress that has been made and how that informs the next week across each of the platforms. And we spend 80% of my staff meeting actually doing product reviews of Intuit Assist. A big large part of it is what the key best practices are, learnings are. And I would tell you that there's a lot of commonality in themes across our learnings across the platform, which actually is simply putting us in a position to accelerate our pivot and our progress and innovation and the timing of going GA across the platform. To your second question, no, we're not impacted by the chip shortage. It does not at all impact our launch plans. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Perfect. Congrats. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you for taking the question guys, and congratulations on a really solid quarter. Two questions, one for Sasan and one for Sandeep and really digging into what I think were some of the bigger surprises in the quarter, Sasan, in this environment, I think we're surprised to see strength in a marketing platform like Mailchimp and you called that out as part of the strength in online services. Do you think that's more of an Intuit sort of independent factor of repackaging, marketing more aggressively distribution? Or is it -- the market is better than we expect? And then for Sandeep, operating margins were really strong in the quarter. Any one-time items or pull forward expenses or push out expenses that we should be mindful of in terms of why that type of operating margin performance isn't going to be reflected in the rest of the year? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks for the question, Keith. I'll take your first one. What you're seeing from us in Mailchimp is entirely execution. We're not getting tailwinds from the macro environment. And as I mentioned, when we closed the acquisition a while back, that our biggest opportunity was to be clear about our product improvements, our lineup and to be able to create one growth platform, develop strength internationally and go to mid-market. And by the way, we've made a lot of progress in all of those areas. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, to be clear. But everything that you're seeing is based on our execution and no macro tailwinds. Sandeep Aujla : And on the margin question, Keith -- on the margin question, let me start by reiterating our commitment to having our expenses growth lower than revenue and in essence, delivering our margin expansion and operating leverage, which is something that we hold dearly and our guidance of 40 to 60 bps expansion for the year reflects the discipline that we have as a management team. On the margin for the quarter, I would share that, I won't get too fixated on the quarterly number. We had some expenses that moved out of the quarter into later parts of the year, including some marketing expenses. And as I shared during the prepared remarks, we are committed to our full year guidance on our operating income. So that's what I would guide you and the teams towards. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Really nice job guys. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for taking my question. Sasan, I wanted to ask about the health of small business. Where do you see right now, strength and weakness in this environment? Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks for the question, Siti. As you know, we've been in this macro environment for some time now. And the small businesses that we serve are resilient for a couple of reasons. One, they're on our platform. And by digitizing what they do, which is how they grow customers and managing their cash flow, they are far more resilient and as we've shared before, anybody that's on our platform is nearly 20 points higher in their success rate than those that are not on our platform. So we are part of sort of the health that we're experiencing on our platform. With that as context, I would just share a couple of data points. One, the number of companies and the number of employees that our small businesses are hiring still remains strong. Two, our total online payments volume grew 21%, which means that our small businesses are continuing to be competitive. and -- and serving their consumers. I also remind us, by the way, I think, a year ago or more, that growth was in the 30% plus. And so we have seen an impact, but just our overall platform is very resilient. And then the last thing I would say is that the cash reserves of our small businesses is 90% of where it was this time last year. However, it's 128% of where it was pre-pandemic. So their cash flow is stronger than several years ago, but 10% down from last year. And then very specifically, as you know, we serve service-based businesses, which is about 70% of the market. We're not concentrated in any one particular area. But you'll see place things like auto repairs and -- that are doing well, professional services that are doing well. But just like pure construction, those that do lending not doing well. So there's sort of ups and downs across the small businesses that we see. But in aggregate, the health comes from the numbers that I shared with you. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for that color, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Very welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Allan Verkhovski : Hi, this is Allan Verkhovski on behalf of Alex Zukin. Thank you for taking the question. QuickBooks Online accounting growth decelerated another 3 percentage points this quarter. With respect to your growth drivers, is there anything that got meaningfully worse in the quarter? Or something that is worth emphasizing to investors? And that will be helpful for thinking about what growth could look like for the rest of the year. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, that was really driven by a larger price increase last year versus this year. That was really the only -- the driver. We liked what we saw in terms of our acquisitions, our retention. So that's really the variance. Allan Verkhovski : Okay. And as just a quick follow-up, would you be able to step through the monthly linearity that you saw in Credit Karma through the quarter and in November? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sorry, can you ask your question again? Allan Verkhovski : Just on the Credit Karma, thinking about the linearity of the business through the quarter and November, I was wondering if you could just kind of talk through on a monthly basis what you saw in the underlying trends for Credit Karma? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Well, I'll answer your question in two ways. One, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we saw and we anticipated further tightening by our partners. By the way, it happened exactly the same time last year. And so we expected that as a -- our partners prepare for the end of the fiscal year and next year, there would be some further tightening, and that's really what we saw. And that was included in our expectations and in our guidance as we thought about the year. That's number one. Number two, there -- not everything is linear because it depends on the number of days like a month like November based on in the US, based on Thanksgiving week, the number of days that people take off that actually impacts certain behaviors. And so there is no linearity. But the quarter just in total was in line with what we expected. Allan Verkhovski : Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Very welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Alex Markgraff with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Alex Markgraff : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Yeah, maybe just be curious to understand, Sasan, as you've done some of the testing around Intuit Assist across product categories, has there been any sort of price testing involved in that as well? And how well received has that been if so? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, sure. Let me answer your question in two ways because I think they're -- it's a great question, and it's connected. First of all, the biggest insight and learning that we have had is, it's really important to have embedded benefits where the customer is doing the work versus sort of something on the side where the assistant is there to help the customer. So what I mean by that is while a customer is looking to build a marketing campaign right within the flow, we, in essence, help them with the audience they should segment, the audience they should target and then we will build their marketing campaign for them, but with them in complete control. So that's a really -- it may sound really obvious, but it's a really important learning, which, by the way, translates to also what we learned in tax, which is within the flow of helping a customer understand their money outcome, helping them understand and doing accuracy checks for them. And if they miss something, calling it out so they can address it right then and there. Those are examples that, by the way, is consistent across all of our platform workflows where embedded matters a lot. The second is depth, depending on the customer and what they're trying to do, there's a level of depth that they want to go to. So an example is within QuickBooks, one of the things that we've been testing and it's been testing really well is a business summary. And the business summary, in essence, provides what we believe are the most important things that, that customer should know and the customer that engages with those business insights and ultimately, will create reports or ask more questions. What we've learned is we're not building propensity models in terms of the timing of when to connect them to an expert. That's a monetizable event for us because if not, you can go on and on having a Q&A and ultimately not get to the benefit as quickly as possible. So those are major insights and learnings and those insights and learnings have led to how we're thinking about monetization. In the case of Mailchimp, having GenAI SKUs based on the things that we can do for customers automatically on their behalf. In the case of QuickBooks and by the way, TurboTax it's a monetizable event because it's a gateway to human expertise and expert help. And then we will be testing GenAI specific SKUs also in QuickBooks. So those are illustrative examples of based on the benefits that we're learning about what's important to customers, that then informs how we think about price testing. And so far, we're pleased with what we're learning and how fast we're pivoting as a company. Alex Markgraff : That's great. Thank you, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Very welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Enders with Citi. Steve Enders : Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question here. I guess I'm going to ask on the tax business, what you saw with some of those newer product initiatives and maybe what kind of drove the strength there year-over-year and the share gains with some of those newer initiatives? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, sure. Let me answer your question on two dimensions. One, there was a macro element, which there were just more filers in the extension season than we anticipated, both by the way, states that extended and states that did not extend. And these are more complex filers and it's actually our sweet spot. It's why we were able to take share in this extension season. And so that's one element of what drove our better-than-expected results. The three areas that we're excited about, these have been durable priorities where we did a lot of tests and experiments and got a lot of green shoots and learnings that will lead into this coming tax season, it's Credit Karma platform, it's TurboTax Live and its Intuit Assist. And I'll briefly touch on each of them. Within the Credit Karma platform, we have more seamlessly built out the tax experience, whether you want to do it yourself or you want somebody to do it for you. And we've been -- we've developed very compelling SKUs within the Credit Karma platform, which having the opportunity to serve 42 million monthly active users that engage five times a month, was not only a great product, but a great set of SKUs. we saw green shoots and we're excited about that as we look at. The second is TurboTax Live. We expanded the scale of our data, AI and expert network. What that means is, and I'll just point out in two areas. One is the fact that for many customers that want to hand off all their taxes to us, we can get their taxes done within an hour. And that's a very big deal to be able to engage an expert, have your data available and get their taxes done in one setting and then also being able to serve business tax customers, which we'll be launching at scale. Those were areas of green shoots. And the last is Intuit Assist. Two big areas. One is accuracy checks and making sure that in place, we help the customer, in essence, correct something that we believe is a mistake. That's a big conversion driver, by the way. And then the second is just explaining refunds, explaining their money outcome, which is all done and driven by Intuit Assist leveraging our knowledge engineering capabilities and our GenAI capabilities. So those are the three things along with the macro where we saw green shoots that give us a lot of confidence as we head into season. Steve Enders : Great. Perfect. Thanks for taking the question. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thank you. This is [indiscernible] for Brent. First question on Mailchimp. Wondering if you could share some color on how it's doing in US versus international? And I don't know if you could talk about also about cross-selling synergies with the rest of the small business platform. And second, any update on how the native bill pay is ramping? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : What was your last question, bill pay? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. On bill pay. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Got it. Thanks for the question. So I'll start with Mailchimp. As we talked about, one of our top priorities includes international. We've spent quite a bit of time and investment in translating to local languages, building out a team that can focus on EMEA and third, making sure that we've got the right pricing lineup and go-to-market plan. And we're executing against that. We like what we see. And it's contributing to the numbers that we reported. And I would say, for us, it's the balance of focus between US and international. We see an enormous opportunity in US and in international. So we have the right balance focus as we think about the geographies. The second, in terms of cross-sell as we shared at Investor Day, we are a big part of the thesis behind the acquisition was to create one growth platform. And what we shared at Investor Day was that we are building an AI native CRM within the QuickBooks platform. We're continuing to make progress in testing and learning and pivoting to get the product market fit. When we get the product market fit. That's really where the cross-sell takes place. We've not assumed or anticipated any contribution from that in our guidance this year. But it's a very important long-term strategic priority. It's the reason why we acquired the platform is to ultimately have one growth platform where you can grow your customers and manage our cash flow all in one place. So that's on the Mailchimp front. On Bill Pay, we're pleased with the fact that we're GA and we -- and as I think noted earlier, what we're seeing with our mid-market customers is -- mid-market versus non-mid market customers, there's a 2x increase in those that are taking the subscription, the paid subscription. So that just means that we're adding value. We also have work ahead of us in Bill pay, things around batch payments, faster funding, all the things that we know we have to have. It's on our roadmap, and it will be launched in the future. So along with the fact that we're GA, we're clear on what the gaps are and what -- and it's on our roadmap, we're working feverishly to really be able to digitize B2B for our customers because we believe it's a big opportunity for our customers to improve their cash flow and a big growth opportunity for us in the long term. So that's the progress on both fronts. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. You're very welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Sasan, as you think about the mid-market opportunity for the QuickBooks and the online ecosystem, given the value prop, is it easier to take share during difficult economic times because of that value prop? Or are customers just hesitant to move and wait for the economy to get better before they'll make a back-office switch? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, great question. I'll share two different perspectives in terms of what we're seeing. The first one is, it really doesn't matter what the economic environment is. If it's great, they don't behave differently. If it's challenging like it is now, they don't behave differently. We certainly don't see them -- any of our customers wanting not to switch because the economy is not good, which leads to the second point I wanted to make. So the headline on the first question is, it's not a tailwind or a headwind, whether it's good times or bad times. However, what I would say is we see some green shoots that's early when we do bundling for our customers. When we go to our customers and share with them that they can digitize all of their payments, all of their payroll and the benefits that it will have for our customers from a cash flow perspective, we see that having traction with our customers. And as we've continued to build out our sales team, we're doing, I think, a far better job of account management. And this is an area where if you look back five years ago, we didn't have the kind of value-added account management teams that we're building now where we're engaging our customers, they\u2019re are hearing from us, right? We've been entirely a [self-sell] (ph) platform. And now that we're engaging our customers, a lot of them are starting to realize, wow, you have payments, I didn't realize you have payroll. I didn't you have time tracking. I didn't realize your own Mailchimp. And that is an opportunity for us to drive an increased penetration in wallet share. So I share that just to say that's where we're getting traction. That's where we're seeing progress, and that's where we see an opportunity as we look ahead. Sandeep Aujla : And Brad, what I'll add is beyond just the QuickBooks side, we also are seeing strong progress on the Mailchimp side in terms of mid-market where historically before we acquired the company was not a focus and now with some of the stuff was Sasan mentioned, including account management, better onboarding, we're seeing better customer acquisition on the mid-market as well as better retention year-over-year in the mid-market, so that opportunity extends beyond just the QuickBooks for us across the entire platform, including Mailchimp. Brad Reback : Excellent. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : You're very welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Yeah. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Sasan, I was wondering if you could just talk about the -- I realize you have a vast and sort of wide open TAM in your markets on the small business side. But I was kind of curious if you're seeing any evidence that small businesses are looking to consolidate multiple technologies onto one platform. You all obviously offer a lot both on the front office and as well in the back office. Are you starting to see any of that sort of activity happening now that you're sort of integrating Mailchimp with QuickBooks? I realize it's early days, and you need that to happen to be successful. But I was just wondering if you're seeing any evidence of that yet? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Kirk, the short answer is, it's early, but we're seeing green shoots, and it's primarily because of what I shared just a moment ago, as we're building out our account management team across Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, as we're talking to our customers, and in fact, I personally spoke to three of them in the last month that are very large mid-market customers, two of them in LA and one of them in Miami. And it actually starts with -- they didn't know even know we have, Payments, Payroll. They didn't even know we're the same company that owns Mailchimp as an example. Some of them will use Mailchimp but they'll use QuickBooks. Some of them use our Payroll, but don't use our Payments and so the thing that we're inspired by and where we believe there's a big opportunity is the fact that we actually have a huge differentiation, which is around data, AI and network of experts and an ecosystem of applications. And the applications are all the things that a small business would want. And our account management team is really discovering for us the fact that our customers just don't know. And so therefore, we engage them, build relationships and talk about the benefits of all of our applications and then what could be done based on all of the capabilities that we have around AI and how that could fuel their success. That's what's really opening up doors for us is just the unknown. And that's what we're excited about as we continue to accelerate building out our talent management team. So I think the long answer to your short question is, yes, customers would prefer to be on one platform. And what we're learning is a lot of customers are not because they just actually don't even know what we do holistically, and that's the mission that we are on. Kirk Materne : Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, you're very welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Arti Vula : Hi, this is Arti Vula on for Mark Murphy. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to touch on QuickBooks Advance. You mentioned at your Investor Day that the success of that product is more about just the go-to-market versus kind of a new product or feature development. So can you kind of discuss progress from your perspective on that front? And then in terms of the mid-market, is that -- can you talk about how that's faring in terms of overall health? And maybe compare that to the lower end of the market? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, sure. Thank you for your question. First of all, just to play back what I shared at the Investor Day, I said if I had to pick one that was the most important lever going forward, it's go-to-market. We are continuing feverishly to build out the product capabilities that we need on the platform because we don't plan to stop at 100 employees. Our plan is to serve mid-market customers over time that are far larger than 100. However, in the near term, sort of near and midterm, the biggest needle mover is go-to-market. And I would tell you that it continues to be bringing on the right skill sets of talent in sales and marketing. And so even in the last, I think, couple of quarters, it's been -- we've hired a very strong marketing leader. We're -- we've hired a very strong sales leader. We're hiring a couple of more sales leaders. We're bringing on account managers that have a lot of skill in selling and nurturing customers. Because when we think about mid-market, it's really about a lot of the examples I was using earlier, which is really helping customers understand they can run their business in one place on one platform and the benefits of doing so and what it will mean to their cash flow and particularly helping them understand our roadmap as a company and what we are doing with Intuit Assist, which is really creating a feature of done for you with always having a gateway to human expertise. And that's enticing for mid-market customers. So net-net, that's the way I would describe our focus area. But we want you to walk away to be we're continuing to invest in the product and in the platform because that's a big opportunity in the long term as well. In terms of health, I think it really -- it comes down to the sector, if you just use US as an example, comes down to the state, the sector that you're in. Generally speaking, based on our history looking backwards, larger, more tenured customers can withstand more of economic turmoil versus someone that literally just started out their business and they only have $100,000 in their savings and if that $100,000 is spent, then they're done, right, they go bankrupt. So it really depends on the size of the business, how long that they've been in business and then the segment that their business is in, all those variables play in. I wouldn't say younger ones are more or less healthy and the older ones are healthier. I would just say it depends on the components that I just described a moment ago. Arti Vula : Perfect. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, very welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Good afternoon. Sasan, maybe we've talked a lot about the Full Service business. And as you look at that business and all the learnings you've talked about, how will you define success for that business at the end of the tax season? Is it the number of returns of process? Is it -- I guess, what are the metrics that you will use to figure if you had success or not? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thanks for your question. First of all, I'll start with something that's really, really important, and that is the investments that we've made over the years where TurboTax is now one platform, and that platform is built on an incredible rich sort of data layer, AI layer and expert network. and now an ecosystem of apps, which is consumer app and business taxes. And the reason I start there is because now we have the ability in one place for you to do your taxes yourself, get help with an expert that's matched specifically to your needs and we can do your taxes for you. And in fact, you can request the same person to do your taxes for you year in and year out and provide advice along the way. The reason I started with that foundational element that we are one platform is as we go to market and start talking to customers about the notion of that choice with us, and we can do everything for you, it actually creates a halo effect. And so what we will look at are metrics around number of customers, conversion, retention, ARPC across the entire franchise. And we also look at it by area. So very specifically, Full Service plays a very important halo effect because it's an element of confidence. It's actually knowing that if I want to hand everything off to someone that Intuit can now do it for me, whether it's virtually or now locally, if I want to connect to an expert. But ultimately, the metric that will matter the most for Full Service is going to be ARPC because it's not just the numbers game. It's the value of these customers. We, of course, will measure a number of customers and ARPC, but ARPC will have the largest impact to our outcomes this year and in the future because now we do your taxes for you as a consumer and as a business. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. And Sandeep just one quick question. You talked about not wanting to focus on one quarter for margins. But I'm wondering, as you look at the year, any differentiation or movement in marketing especially as the tax season unfolds? Sandeep Aujla : Kartik, we are continuing to invest across our product, across the Big Bet, across GenAI, across marketing and particularly as we go to Full Service, we want to make sure that we are expanding our brand's equity beyond the DIY category to the Full Service. But I would not expect any meaningful shift in the seasonality of our marketing spend, which I think is the question that you're asking. So -- and I feel pretty good about the campaigns and the investments we've been making across the go-to-market motion across tax as well as the other segments. Kartik Mehta : Thank you. Yes. That was the question I was asking. I just did a poor job of it. So thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Brad Sills : Great. Thank you so much. Another question here on TurboTax as you're kind of heading into the next tax season here. Now that the focus is more on full service and TurboTax Live, is there something different about the end user, the end consumer filer that you're targeting now, say, going after that CPA segment that's different from traditionally, where you've gone after that tax store, you've had tremendous success there against tax stores. Now that CPA segment. Is there some difference there? And is there some learning from last year in go-to-market that you can apply this year to gain more traction there at that end of the market? Thanks, again. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Brad, thank you for your question. And it's actually spot on the way you asked it, and that is we view our opportunity as nearly 100 million customers that are either consumers, which is about 88 million of the 100 million and the rest are our business customers, small businesses. We view our opportunity going after them, which is a combination of small pros, mom-and-pop shops, stores is actually a smaller part of the whole pie. And in the last, I would say, 18 months, we've experimented a lot with how do we go after these customers, how do we raise awareness, how do we get them to consider and ultimately, how do we ensure that when they come to our front door, front door is a service front or not a software front door because of the behaviors that they have. And a lot of those both go-to-market and platform insights and learnings is what has informed a number of things that I touched on earlier that we experimented with and ran test in the tax extension season and what we feel good about going into this coming season. So it was a long answer to your question, but yeah, a lot of those insights have informed our game plan because we're not just the software platform, we're a software and service platform, given who we're focused on serving. And by the way, while I have the floor, the same thing applies to small businesses as we think about what we're doing to embed QuickBooks Live in our offering. Brad Sills : Wonderful. Thank you, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Very welcome. Operator : Our last question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. I have a follow-up for Sandeep and then one for you, Sasan. Sandeep, on the margins in the quarter, you cited marketing, which I assume was predominantly that. Was there anything else in the quarter that was beneficial? Or was that the lion's share? And then you mentioned spread over the balance of the year and in Kartik\u2019s answer, I felt you kind of were speaking to TurboTax but it looks like you're expecting a bit of a down quarter on margin in the second quarter. So we'll -- and it seemed like it was mostly in small business, the real benefit in the first quarter. So will that end as of second quarter? Is that truly something that is going to tail off in the second half as well? And then I'll come back to the follow-up. Thanks. Sandeep Aujla : Sure. Thanks for the question, Scott. The way I would think about the Q1, we had multiple expenses that moved out of the quarter into later parts of the year, and marketing was one of those expense lines, and I would not say that marketing was the lion's share of it. There were several things that we expected will hit us in October that got pushed out, but I would definitely not take away as marketing being the lion's share of items that got pushed out. And you're right, some of those will get caught up, and we'll have those expenses in Q2 and so once you look at Q1 and Q2 spent together, those things will start normalizing out. Again, I'll bring you and the team back to the fact that you should all be focusing on our margins on a full year basis. In any given year, we could have different expense trend lines. So again, we remain confident in our guidance for the full year across the margins for the company. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Appreciate that. And Sasan, we're pretty well along now into Karma Guarantee. Would love just to get an update on that and Credit Karma was a bit stronger than we had anticipated in the quarter. Is it something that could potentially inflect a positive year-over-year growth in the fiscal first half? Or is that something that you'd expect more in the back half? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you for your question. First of all, I'll start with, based on our insights and learnings from last year, we really took an approach to be intentional and prudent about the guidance that we provide, which means taking into account not only a macro environment, but also not just banking, a bunch of initiatives in the back half of the year. We're aggressive in the initiatives that we're working on, but we did not make them into our guidance because we just wanted to be thoughtful and prudent. With that as context, I would -- I love your question about Karma Guarantee because we haven't explicitly been talking about it and it's not because it's not important anymore. It's because of the way we are now thinking about it and incorporating it into several areas. One is you've heard us talk about the entire app redesign, which is far more focused on putting the right benefits in front of the customers at the right time, which we talked about at Investor Day, that coupled with Intuit Assist. And the example I used in earlier was the fact that prime customers spend literally four or five hours doing comparison shopping between credit cards because they can get whatever credit card they want, but they're looking for the perps. Now we can automatically do that for them based on all of the data and everything that we know about them. So you combine the app redesign with Intuit Assist and our focus on prime customers. Karma Guarantee plays an important role helping customers, particularly those that have a hard time getting access to financial products, guarantee them that if they choose what's in front of them that they're going to be approved for it or we'll put $50 in their bank account. So the combination of those things is what the set of initiatives are that we are focused on that we expect will drive engagement, higher frequency and monetization. And we've not included that in our guidance, but it's very important for the future growth of the business. Not only that, and I'll end with this, tax is an enormous part of it. We've now spent several years thinking about how does every interaction and move a customer mix in the Credit Karma platform? How does that inform what that will mean to their taxes. So that when it's tax time, it's a much more seamless experience along with compelling offers. So taxes now, as we look ahead, such an important part of the life of the member and our focus area within Credit Karma. And all of those combined is what we have high hopes for in the future. Again, not in our guidance but important for the future. Scott Schneeberger : Excellent. Thanks for all that. Sasan Goodarzi : You're very welcome. Operator : All right. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no -- go ahead, sir. Sasan Goodarzi : Sorry, go ahead. Operator : There no further questions, so you may proceed with any additional or closing remarks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sorry to have interrupted you. I was just going to say thank you for all the questions, and we look forward to hearing from everyone next quarter. Until then, be safe. Bye, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This does conclude today's conference call, and you may disconnect at this time.",

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins? Kim Watkins : Thanks, Angela. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. I\u2019m here with Intuit\u2019s CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla.

A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had another strong quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform. We\u2019re executing on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Second quarter revenue grew by 11%, and we are on track to achieve our fiscal year 2024 full year guidance of 11% to 12% revenue growth while expanding operating margins. Let\u2019s start with tax. We are confident in our innovation and game plan to win, and are reiterating our full fiscal year guidance of 7% to 8% revenue growth for the Consumer Group. Tax preparation represents a $35 billion TAM. This includes $31 billion within the assisted consumer and business tax categories, which we have barely started to penetrate. We are well-positioned to disrupt the assisted category by leveraging data, AI, and our Virtual Expert Platform, to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses. By leveraging the power of our platform and ecosystem, we\u2019re also extending TurboTax to our Credit Karma members and QuickBooks Online small business customers by enabling them to complete their taxes and access expertise directly within these products. Let me share more about our \u2013 the areas of focus this season. First, we can serve consumers however they want to file, virtually or in-person, while providing confidence their taxes are being done accurately and they are getting their maximum refund. More than 80% of U.S. filers live within a 10 mile radius of a TurboTax expert. These experts use Intuit\u2019s Virtual Expert Platform that\u2019s powered by data and AI, to deliver best-in-class service. While it\u2019s early in the season, TurboTax Live Full Service is resonating with customers. We\u2019re seeing strong growth and the offering has a Product Recommendation Score of 88 season-to-date, one of the highest at Intuit. Second, small businesses can file their taxes with TurboTax and, if a small business is a QuickBooks Online customer, they can file their taxes with an expert. With these offerings, they can maximize their refund, and get advice from experts when they need it. Our campaigns and easy to use experience are driving strong early interest. Business tax returns have a much higher average revenue per return because they are more complex and we expect them to contribute to average revenue per return expansion over time. Third, we\u2019re more deeply integrating Credit Karma and TurboTax, making it even more seamless for Credit Karma members to file with TurboTax directly in the Credit Karma app, with exclusive offers for members, whether they want to file themselves or with an expert. We\u2019re also unlocking the benefits of the Credit Karma platform for tax filers to make smart money decisions. This includes earlier access to their refund or, for those that qualify, access to an interest-free Refund Advance loan in as little as 30 seconds after IRS acceptance, when depositing their refund into a Credit Karma Money account. This is designed to lead to higher engagement and monetization in Credit Karma over time. Fourth, Intuit Assist, our GenAI powered financial assistant, is live in TurboTax this season. With Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of \"done for you,\" where the hard work is done \"automagically\" on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. For example, customers are using Intuit Assist to better understand their refund. In early results, Intuit Assist\u2019s helpfulness rating is 1.5x greater than our legacy explanations, indicating Intuit Assist is helping deliver confidence to TurboTax customers. Our focus this tax season further showcases how our Big Bets have accelerated innovation and growth for the future. We\u2019re leveraging the power of data and AI with Intuit Assist to revolutionize the speed to benefit for customers, disrupting the assisted consumer and business tax categories by connecting people with experts virtually, and bringing the TurboTax and Credit Karma experience together to unlock smart money decisions. We are off to a great start in tax. Let me now highlight progress across two of our Big Bets. As a reminder, our five Big Bets are : revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our first big bet is to \"revolutionize speed to benefit.\" Our platform enables us to innovate for our customers with speed and at scale, which is foundational to all of our other Big Bets. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform, with data and AI fueling innovation across the platform. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business, and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer which fuels what\u2019s possible with AI. And with our GenAI Operating System, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough GenAI experiences across our platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLMs, as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost efficient way. As I mentioned earlier, with Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of \"done for you,\" where the hard work is done \"automagically\" on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their success. Intuit Assist is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade, and is in the hands of select customers now. We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform, driving customer growth, accelerated adoption of services and live offerings. I\u2019m excited about the rapid pace at which we are innovating, testing, learning, and adapting to deliver our core benefits of more money, no work and complete confidence for customers. Let me share a few updates. First TurboTax, as I shared earlier, Intuit Assist is live in the product this season and is delivering increased confidence to our customers. Second, Mailchimp, to help small businesses grow revenue and save them time, we\u2019re providing AI-powered automations and content generation using Intuit Assist. Third, QuickBooks, Intuit Assist is in beta and is designed to help small businesses optimize cash flow and make confident decisions to grow their business. New customers who were previously running their business manually will be able to get started quickly by sharing their email, website and bank account information. Their unstructured data will be translated into benefits for them, such as generating customized pay-enabled invoices that save time and enable customers to get paid faster, experiencing the benefits of switching to a digital platform. And for existing customers, we will translate their data and analyze their money in and money out transactions into insights and recommendations. Intuit Assist will do the work for our customers in the background with suggested automated actions that increases customer productivity by saving time and leading to better outcomes such as getting paid faster and updating capital. Furthermore, we intend to provide an option to connect and interact with an expert to help provide insights and make decisions specific to their financial situation and fuel their success at the moments that matter most, such as closing their books. Fourth, Credit Karma, Intuit Assist for Credit Karma is in beta and we\u2019re excited about the rapid innovation and the progress we\u2019re making to help connect members to financial products that are right for them, saving them time and money. We\u2019re focused on using GenAI to interact with members to help answer their questions in a highly personalized way when shopping for financial products. Customers can interact, learn more, and ask questions to help make confident decisions. Intuit Assist will engage more members with a wide range of financial needs beyond Credit. We recently expanded by 6x the number of topics we can provide help on and now address items like major purchases, home buying, savings, and more. We believe this can drive increased member engagement and conversion, and drive higher revenue per monthly active user. We remain excited with our early progress with Intuit Assist across the company. It\u2019s changing our relationship with customers as we move from being a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that customers can rely on daily to power their prosperity. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital, and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. In Mailchimp, we\u2019re focused on better serving mid market customers across different stages of their lifecycle to drive higher engagement and retention. After we have successfully onboarded them, we\u2019re pairing larger customers with an account manager to help them understand and adopt the breadth of Mailchimp\u2019s capabilities. We\u2019re seeing green shoots from account management, which gives us confidence in the future. Customers who have engaged with an account manager have higher monthly revenue retention. We believe this will also drive higher ARPC over time. Intuit Assist is live in Mailchimp\u2019s higher end offerings and is designed to help customers develop personalized marketing campaigns and drive their revenue growth. We\u2019re offering customers three AI-powered automations today, including new customer welcome, abandoned shopping cart and recovering lost customers. Automations are time consuming to set up, but can drive higher revenue. Intuit Assist personalized automations are 50% more likely to be activated by customers. Intuit Assist is also reducing work by generating new content and editing existing content for marketing campaigns. Recent improvements have driven GenAI text generation adoption rates by more than 70% over the past several months, reducing work for our customers. Getting paid fast remains a big challenge for small businesses. We are uniquely positioned to help customers with our end-to-end money platform and innovations such as easy discovery, auto-enabled payments, payment-enabled invoices, instant deposit and get paid up front, which are all helping our customers get paid faster and drive adoption of payments. Total online payment volume growth was 20% in the quarter. We are beginning to roll out a new payment-enabled invoicing experience that will provide more benefits to customers, including more ways to get paid. While early, we\u2019re seeing that customers who use the new invoicing experience are engaging more driving increase in customer adoption of our payment rails to get their invoices paid. We\u2019re also making progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow. The number of connections in our QuickBooks business network has doubled since August, and we\u2019re pleased with the initial adoption of our bill pay offering. To better serve small businesses, during the quarter, we began rolling out faster payment timelines for qualified customers that reduce payment time by 40%, including a paid next-day ACH option and batch payments, allowing customers to hold on to their cash longer and save time. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our platform, we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us, and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We\u2019re honored to be recognized by Bloomberg as one of the top 50 Companies to Watch in 2024 and to be ranked 22 on this year\u2019s Just 100, and the highest ranked customer or software company on the list. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep. Sandeep Aujla : Thanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 we delivered another strong quarter, despite the IRS opening approximately one week later this year. We achieved healthy operating margins and are on track to achieve our full year guidance as we continue to deliver operating leverage across the business. Our Q2 results include revenue of $3.4 billion, up 11%, GAAP operating income of $369 million versus $270 million last year, up 37%. Non-GAAP operating income of $1 billion versus $856 million last year, up 17%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.25 versus $0.60 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.63 versus $2.20 last year, up 20%. Turning to our business segments. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem revenue, which grew 21%. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which resonates with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the small business and self-employed group is threefold : grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 19% in Q2, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. We continue to prioritize disrupting the small business mid-market through continued focus on both go-to-market and product innovations. While mid-market customers are a smaller subset of the total small business TAM, they drive a higher ARPC over time given their more complex needs and higher usage of services across our platform. This coupled with our strategy to sell more of our ecosystem services to existing customers, shift the emphasis in our growth formula towards ARPC over time. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 24% in Q2, driven by payroll, payments, Mailchimp, capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions, higher effective prices and a mix shift towards higher end offerings. Within payments, the revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payment offerings to manage their cash flow, higher effective prices and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing a refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16% in Q2. Now moving to our Desktop Ecosystem. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 10% in the second quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the mid-teens. We are more than two years into a three-year transition for customers that remain on a license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. In fiscal 2025, the tailwinds from the three-year transition will be behind us, but we expect our Desktop Enterprise offering, which accounts for over half of desktop accounting revenue to grow in the high single-digit range. We also will continue to encourage remaining desktops subscription customers who tend to be more complex and higher value to migrate seamlessly to either QuickBooks Online or our desktop enterprise offering when they are ready. Additionally, we see opportunities to continue to price the product for value. The online ecosystem remains a growth catalyst longer term. Shifting to our Consumer and ProTax Groups. Our full year outlook remains unchanged, even though Consumer Group revenue declined 5% in the quarter, reflecting an approximately one week later IRS opened this year. We are confident in our game plan to win this season and are reiterating our guidance for Consumer Group of 7% to 8% revenue growth in fiscal 2024. Turning to the ProTax Group, the revenue grew 8% to $274 million in Q2, reflecting the timing of when tax forms were delivered, which is a driver for revenue recognition. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $375 million in Q2, flat to a year ago, primarily reflecting growth in Credit Karma Money, credit cards and auto loans offset by decline in home loans, personal loans and auto insurance. We saw select partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards in Q2, reflecting expected macro trends. And as a reminder, Q2 is typically the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. We expect Q3 to benefit from additional Credit Karma Money revenue during tax season. In summary, I am pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year. Now shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions. They remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $536 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on our market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on April 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12% and GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18%; non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%. GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $7.77 to $7.84, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.31 to $9.38. As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full year fiscal 2024 and Q3 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Sandeep. And just to quickly wrap up, we\u2019re very confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy, our progress with our five big bets, and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe that this will change our relationship with our customers, becoming their trusted advisors, leading to higher engagement and monetization. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. With that, let\u2019s open it up to your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Sasan and Sandeep, I want to dig into the health of the small business. Just two part question, on the online accounting system, revenue seems to be in line, our expectation site to decel. Is there any one-time factor that influenced and how should you think about second half, given that\u2019s an easy comp? And other part is on the services, while we\u2019re pleasantly surprised, it\u2019s accelerated. And you talked about some of this payroll payments and Mailchimp. Is there anything like you are doing differently, specifically drilling into the Mailchimp, how is that part of the business doing? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Siti, thank you for your question. Maybe I\u2019ll start us off. And Sandeep, please jump in as you wish. I mean as the headline that I would give Siti is that we\u2019re really pleased with the momentum that we have, the growth that we\u2019ve experienced. When you think about it in context of the current macro environment, we\u2019re continuing to see larger, higher value customers, mid market customers want to shift to digitization. And the more we spend time with them, with our account managers, with our sales folks, with our customer success folks, they tend to have a tendency of wanting to move more of their services to us because for the most part, we are already the standard of financial management solutions that they use for their financial records. But they see it as an opportunity to get paid faster, manage their workforce to be able to use our capabilities, to be able to market to their customers. And so the net of it that I would leave you with is I like our momentum in this macro environment. We expect that to continue for the rest of the year. And there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes in our online accounting and online services. And so I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it. The most important element to take away is the 21% overall online growth. And our services are strong and we continue to innovate with our services. And I expect that we\u2019ll continue to lead digitization and transformation for our small businesses. Sandeep, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything, but those would be the headlines for me, Siti. Sandeep Aujla : Yes. Sasan, good coverage [ph]. Siti, what I would also remind you of is, as we\u2019ve shared in the past, there are three imperatives that you focus on as a management team, new customer acquisition, driving adoption of our platform and being better together across our platform. And with that in new customer acquisition, our team continues to focus on mid-market customers. As you call those mid-market customers, they\u2019re a larger, richer revenue pool. They have higher customer acquisition costs, but they also take a little longer to ramp up because most of the size of the price in those mid-market customers on services revenue, which ramps up as opposed to accounting, which you start booking as soon as they become a customer, so just a dynamic to keep in mind. That\u2019s why in my prepared remarks, I called out that our growth formula will continue to start leaning more towards ARPC going forward. And the second component of the services is basically us executing on our focus of driving adoption of our platform. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks. Great execution, guys. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Hi, congratulations to Sasan and Sandeep. Really good call here. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us an update on what\u2019s happening in the SMB market. Looks like enterprise spending seems to be stabilizing. I know that you\u2019re not really enterprise except for QuickBooks Advanced, but how did you characterize the outlook for small businesses given that the economy is on stable footing and we don\u2019t have the worries that we had going into calendar 2022? Thank you so much once again. Sasan Goodarzi : Kash, great to hear from you. Great question. I would \u2013 let me categorize the answer in two buckets. First of all, facts are friendly, and let me start with some facts. What we see across our base is that cash reserves are down 11% year-over-year. That\u2019s really what small businesses care about. But it\u2019s actually up 115% over pre-pandemic levels. And so the takeaway you should have in that is small businesses are being challenged in this macro environment. Consumers are spending less dollars, but they\u2019re actually healthier at the aggregate level than they were several years ago. In fact, what I would call out is the number of hours worked is higher this year, several points compared to last year. So that just the strength of the work that they\u2019re doing, being able to have access to talent is in a better position for small businesses compared to last year. And that, by the way, as you can imagine differs by country and by sector, sectors like real estate, IT spending is struggling if the sector small business is in, but things like professional services, auto repairs is actually quite healthy. Last thing I would end with is the higher value customers more the mid-market customers are healthier than those that are small and just starting out, which by the way, we\u2019ve seen this in our 20 plus years, right, we\u2019ve seen this is a normal trend whereby the larger businesses have a lot more levers to be able to pull and they\u2019re generally healthier. Lastly, our view, and we\u2019re not economists, but we see a lot of data. Our view is that 2024 is going to be a lot of the same for small businesses. We don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s going to be any kind of an economic tailwind as we think about the next \u2013 the rest of the calendar year. Kash Rangan : Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much and nice job in Q2. Maybe a tax question, just with the slower start to the season, Sasan, and we appreciate every season is more and more backend loaded, but can you talk about what it is that you\u2019re seeing in the funnel and anything else that supports your confidence in the full year consumer guide? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure, Brad. First of all, I\u2019ll amplify what you started out with. Having been in the tax business and ran it more than ten years ago and watching our trends in the last ten years. Every season there\u2019s a push to a later start, and it\u2019s just a consumer behavior, and we\u2019re seeing that this year, so that\u2019s not anything unique. There\u2019s two things that I would call out that are strategic to us, that are worth calling out, because we see green shoots in both with the early part of season. One is full service. Just as a refresher, there\u2019s nearly 100 million consumers and small businesses that spend about $30 billion to have somebody else do their taxes for them. And we really leaned into our overall full service experience, we really leaned into our campaigns, both on air, digital. Very basic things, by the way, that we didn\u2019t used to have the capabilities of that we\u2019re now building, which is if you use an expert and you love that expert, that you can recommend that expert to a friend, that, that\u2019s basics. But the infrastructure that we\u2019re building to really disrupt the full service space is a necessity. And we feel very good about the green shoots that we\u2019re seeing, both on the consumer front and on the business tax front. And I\u2019ll remind you that this is our first year leaning all the way into business tax. So it\u2019s beyond early, but everything that we\u2019ve seen just indicates that this is enormous opportunity for us. So that\u2019s on the full service front. The second I would mention is Credit Karma. This is really an area where we have nearly 45 million monthly active users. They engage more than five times a month, and the majority of those monthly active users actually use a different method and not TurboTax. And so we\u2019ve really heavily invested in the experience, whether you want to do it yourself in the app or you want us to do it for you, which is full service and compelling offerings that we\u2019ve been testing and scaling. And we also like the green shoots there. So those are the two things that I would call out, and it really positions us for share of spend. I\u2019ll end with the following, which is we\u2019ve set the goal line in taxes, our share of total IRS returns, and really what matters is the share of spend that we\u2019re getting. And full service is essential for that, both this year and in the future. Brad Zelnick : Thanks, Sasan. Great color, and keep up the good work. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Michael Turrin : Hey, great. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. I was hoping we could go back to the mix of online services, and maybe you could just help us compare and contrast in more detail what you\u2019re seeing from a growth perspective across the payroll payments and Mailchimp business? And is there a float aspect at all to the payroll portion of the business that might be helping reinforce some of the margin strength you\u2019re seeing? Given headwinds from the slower start to tax? I think a lot of focus on just the EPS strength in the quarter. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Do you mind repeating the last part of your question? Michael Turrin : Yes. Just wondering if there\u2019s at all on the payroll side a flow component that might be also just softly helping margin outside of the consumer headwinds you\u2019re seeing. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Let me start with the overall services question that you asked and Sandeep will weigh in here with some of the facts that you asked around flow. I think the thing that I would just say around services goes back to my earlier comment, which is we\u2019re just spending a lot more time with higher value customers really helping them understand what we can do to digitize their businesses, and by the way, continuing to improve our offerings. And so as we talked about earlier, our total online payments growth this quarter was 20% in a fairly tough macro environment. That\u2019s because we continue to invest in making the experience easier, providing multiple methods to get paid instant deposit, getting paid upfront. So those really help with, in essence, payments adoption. Our payroll adoption has been strong, particularly larger customers and with full service, and we\u2019re continuing to really invest in some of the most important foundational elements with Mailchimp that higher value customers are adopting, and particularly some of the things that I called out with intuitive. So it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s a combination of all of our services and the focus on higher value customers that is really helping us with some of the services adoption. Maybe. Sandeep, I\u2019ll turn it over to you on the float and anything else you want to add. Sandeep Aujla : Sure. So thanks, Sasan. Michael, the float component is a very small part of our payroll business, as one thing that we really aim to do for our small businesses is to hold their cash as little as possible. So float is not a big component for us. And I think the overarching theme of your question was the ability for Intuit to preserve the earnings power of the company despite the one week delay in the IRS opening. I think Sasan touched on that. And it\u2019s also some of the great work that the team has been doing around acquiring larger customers around the lineup, work we did to make the higher end SKUs in payroll more attractive to those customers. The work the team is doing around mid market account management and Mailchimp. So it\u2019s a plethora of activities that continues to give us confidence across portfolio of assets that we have here at Intuit. Michael Turrin : Appreciate the details there. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you, Michael. Operator : The next question comes from Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Taylor McGinnis : Yes, hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe another one on online services. So if I heard you correctly earlier, it sounds like you guys are expecting a more stable macro environment as we move throughout the year. So can you just talk about what that means for the durability of the acceleration in online services that we just saw to 24% year-over-year? Could you actually see online services hang in here at these levels? Was there anything one-time in nature? And just curious, as the macro remains more challenging, how the pricing lever could be used there to help you guys during this time? Thanks so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure. Taylor, let me add a few things if I could. First of all, I\u2019ll start with we don\u2019t view the macro environment as entirely remaining stable. We think it\u2019s going to continue to be uncertain. So we\u2019re not sort of banking on any of our growth coming from any type of a tailwind from the macro environment. We think 2024 will be somewhat choppy, like 2023 was from a macro environment perspective. And we see it in the consumer \u2013 credit scores of consumers. As you know, we see over 100 million members across Credit Karma. And their credit scores in the last couple of years are down almost 20 points. Gen Z credit card balances are up over 60% and those are just a couple of illustrative examples that consumers are strained. So the first uber-point would be that we think the environment is stable to uncertain and we\u2019re not trying to outguess the economy, but really focus on our customers and our innovation, which gets to the second point, and that is we have confidence in the guidance that we provided of the 16% to 17% for the year, even in context of the macro environment, just because we continue to really emphasize and focus with our high value mid-market customers digitization. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s leading to our overall 21% online growth that we talked about. And that\u2019s what gives us confidence in our guidance. And really, as we look into the future, our entire focus is really all about our innovation and our go-to-market to win, despite the tough economic environment. Sandeep Aujla : Taylor, the one thing I would add, and just to build on Sasan\u2019s point, you asked a question around pricing, pricing power. Our tenant around pricing is around the power of our offerings and the innovation we\u2019re building into the offerings. And the perceived actual value that we\u2019re delivering to our customers is not related to the macro environment. So that\u2019s another point I just wanted to emphasize in terms of how we think about our pricing. Taylor McGinnis : Thanks. Really appreciate the thoughts. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Sasan, maybe a GenAI question for you. Clearly it\u2019s something that continues to really evolve and become a core part and parcel of the company, both on the SMB side and the consumer side. I wanted to ask, if you look at the coming tax season on the consumer side, how do you expect to see the benefit of some of the assist functionality? Is it more converting kind of free to pay? Is it pay to pay more? And then similarly on both Credit Karma and on the SMB side, if you think about the progression of the year, kind of where are you seeing the biggest opportunities as you start to see the interactions build on the platform? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Alex, thank you. Great question. Let me start with one headline, particularly as we\u2019ve been in beta or with certain capabilities at scale and GA. I\u2019ll start with a headline which is we believe that over time, and I want to emphasize the overtime piece, that this is going to create an entirely new category of experiences and growth that is not even possible today because of truly creating a set of experiences where the work is done for customers. And there\u2019s always a gateway to human expert that\u2019s all AI powered. And the more we\u2019re in market, the more we\u2019re learning, adjusting, adapting, the more we are convinced that we\u2019re going to be able to create a new category of services and what\u2019s possible to penetrate our $300 billion in TAM. Now with that said, let me get real specific and sort of real tactical. The second headline news that I would give is none of the work that we\u2019re doing with Intuit Assist, which is really about what we\u2019re doing across the platform. It\u2019s not a feature. None of it is in our results today, and we\u2019re not counting on it to be in our results in the near future. But with that said, to answer your question in tax, to start with, there\u2019s a couple of areas where it will have profound impact. One is full service. And the profound impact, by the way, is from the investments that we\u2019ve made in the last five years. I mean, to do what we\u2019re doing in full service at scale and think about it, it\u2019s really based on data, AI, ecosystem of apps, because now we can do your taxes through Credit Karma, through the cookbooks platform and one of the largest networks of experts that we have. And all of that sits on machine learning, knowledge engineering and now GenAI capabilities. So the biggest in our view, based on what we\u2019re seeing in market, right, the biggest opportunity is about the ease and the speed of getting people\u2019s taxes done. So imagine a world where you\u2019re a full service customer that we can get your taxes done in less than an hour, maximum refund and extend your dollars because of what we can do with you on the Credit Karma platform and excellent service, the best service you can imagine in the world, which by the way is supported by our product recommendation score of 88. So really it\u2019s full service that will have the biggest impact. Now the whole underlying platform is what full service uses. And so the other is over time. Yes, it will help with conversion. And really it\u2019s about confidence. And we\u2019re seeing that right now where Intuit assist when it\u2019s engaged to understand my tax outcome and refund outcome, the helpful rating is one and a half times better than we\u2019ve ever seen and by the way, we are very early, we haven\u2019t perfected it by any means. So that\u2019s on the tax front. Just very quickly, let me touch on Credit Karma. As you know, one of the powers of Credit Karma on behalf of our customers is we know everything about the customer. We know have all the data and leverage AI to deliver personalized credit cards that are right for them, or personal loans, whatever it may be. One thing that\u2019s profound with GenAI that we\u2019re learning and seeing in market today is now customers can interact with Credit Karma, whereas before they couldn\u2019t. The from to is, the from is, I would show you the three credit cards that are right for you based on everything that I know about you. But now you can interact with Credit Karma and ask, hey, I\u2019m looking for travel rewards, which of these three credit cards are the best for me? And then we interact with you and help you understand, which one is the best for you based on an additional set of questions that you\u2019ve asked, where we now know more about you. That\u2019s profound, because that will, over time, drive higher engagement, monetization, et cetera. And on the small business front, our entire focus is revenue and profitability increase. Everything that we are testing in market, learning in market is so that we can help you with campaigns that increases your revenue or manage your cash flow that better helps you with profitability. And one of the things we\u2019re testing with is to have experts that actually provide insights to you and those insights could be, hey, it\u2019s time to take out capital because your sales are strong, or hey, I just finished doing your books for you. Would you like to have a conversation so you can understand your cash flow and how your books close for the month? And that\u2019s a monetizable event for us. So probably a longer answer that you were looking for, but those are the things that are in market where we\u2019re learning and adjusting and we think over time. We haven\u2019t perfected any of this yet, because it\u2019s actually hard, but we believe it\u2019ll create an entirely new category of services and growth. Alex Zukin : Super insightful. Thank you, guys. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you, Alex. Operator : The next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Yes, thanks very much. And I\u2019ll echo the congrats on the quarter. Yes, Sasan, can you just remind us where we are in terms of some of the cross-sell of QuickBooks into the Mailchimp base and vice versa? And when Intuit Assist goes GA for QuickBooks, will that be the point at which Intuit \u2013 can answer questions across sort of the front office and back office for customers? Can you just talk about that a little bit? Thanks so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, great question, Kirk. Let me start with the Intuit Assist question first. And I\u2019ll share with you how we\u2019re sequencing it. Right now our entire focus and remember, everything that we are doing here is based on data and AI. A lot of our investments are what you don\u2019t see, which is ensuring that the data is usable, that it\u2019s clean, that it\u2019s structured the right way, and that our machine learning, knowledge engineering and GenAI capabilities can digest all of the data. Inclusive of data by the way, that\u2019s contributed by the customer, like access to their Gmail account, access to their Excel spreadsheet, because a lot of customers data are in those two places, or they\u2019re in shoeboxes and being able to take pictures. And for us to be able to digest that data and actually deliver insights. So our first priority of order is to ensure that if you\u2019re using our small business platform and if you are looking to put together marketing campaigns, that Intuit Assist is doing that for you. The second element of what we are focused on is then being able to transfer and use Intuitive Assist across QuickBooks and Mailchimp, because all the data points are connected. That is absolutely where we are headed and it\u2019s sequenced in second place compared to what I just articulated, because we have to nail via the basics. But that\u2019s actually where the power of our platform will show up for our customers, where whether you\u2019re in Credit Karma or TurboTax, you can ask whatever question you want that is relevant in your life and we can answer it because all of our data points are connected and our AI capabilities are, in essence, working across the product. So that is sequence, but we\u2019re working on that as we speak. The second is cross-sell. First of all, I\u2019ll start with we\u2019re not thinking about it in terms of cross-sell. We\u2019re thinking about it in terms of product integration. So what we are really focused on, and this is, by the way, this applies to TurboTax and Credit Karma. This applies to Mailchimp and QuickBooks. What we\u2019re really focused on is integrating the product at moments of truth that matters most based on how the customer does the work. Like, for instance, if you are in QuickBooks on your left lap [ph]. This is just an illustrative example because we\u2019re actually testing a lot of this, is that you can actually see how you can manage your customers and put together marketing campaigns. And when you engage and click on that, you have the Mailchimp engine that is working behind the scenes. And after maybe a couple of free trials, then we share with you how much it is to pay for these capabilities. So that\u2019s what I mean by product integration. We want to nail the benefits at the moment of truth that matters versus just try to sell you Mailchimp within the platform. We\u2019ve found over time that that\u2019s not as effective. What\u2019s most effective is the product integration. So that\u2019s the approach that we\u2019re taking across all of our platforms. Kirk Materne : That\u2019s it. Thanks so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Just on for [ph] Credit Karma to get back to growth, what are the key ingredients that you need to see for that to get back to growth versus the declines we\u2019ve seen the last year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, a good question. A couple of things. One, which we are starting to see, which is just stability of partners and the environment. For the most part, other than some select partners, we\u2019ve actually seen stability with our partners. And we\u2019ve actually seen verticals like insurance come back, which saw a big decline last year. So one is just stability, and then the second is just the areas of innovation that we are focused on. One is we\u2019ve redesigned the entire app. Now it\u2019s rolled out to all members, which is a massive, massive feat. And based on the redesign of the app, there are many ways in which we can engage customers more so than we could before. And that will actually drive monetization. So that\u2019s one lever beyond the macro that I mentioned. The second is Intuit Assist. It\u2019s the example I provided earlier where now customers can actually interact with us and ask questions and let us know what\u2019s important to them and we can personalize things in a way that we could never before. And based on very early testing, we see the engagement is higher when customers are interacting with Intuit Assist, which over time will lead to monetization. That\u2019s the second area. Third is just a number of initiatives that we have around prime. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, prime is actually quite a large part of our monthly active users, but we\u2019ve never really focused on it and now that\u2019s an area of focus. And then last but not least is TurboTax. And TurboTax, the way we\u2019re thinking about it is actually about product integration because the more we can engage members year round around, if they took out a mortgage or having them take a snapshot of their W-2 and letting them know what their refund could be, the more we can actually penetrate more of the members to use TurboTax as a method to get their access to the refund, all those things creating one platform is what we believe and are confident actually that will get us to accelerated growth and it\u2019s really in that order. So let me pause there hopefully, is that helps Brent? Brent Thill : Yes, it was great. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : The next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna. James Friedman : Hi. Thank you. I was hoping to get your thoughts on the opportunity for additional bill pay options. I believe Sasan, you mentioned in your prepared remarks rolling out same day ACH. But any high level thoughts on other bill pay options, including virtual credit cards? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, thank you for the question. First of all, the key to success for us, given where we are on the rollout is one network connections. And as you heard in our remarks, albeit very early, the number of business network connections has doubled since August. And that\u2019s important because it helps, it\u2019s a huge step forward to then digitize how we in essence help customers get paid and pay bills. The second is just executing on our roadmap. The big thing that we\u2019re starting to roll out that we talked about earlier is just faster payments and that\u2019s through both paid ACH next day that we\u2019re rolling out and also batch payments. And so we\u2019re going to continue to look at what\u2019s most important for our customers and that\u2019s what\u2019s informing our roadmap. But we have to do it in conjunction with continuing to increase network connections. And we\u2019re really excited about in the long term what\u2019s possible, digitizing all of B2B, because it\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly beneficial to our customers because they get paid faster, and two, it\u2019s really a sticky product. James Friedman : Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Congrats for me as well. Question for Sandeep. As we think about this year, you kind of said you didn\u2019t expect a lot of kind of recovery to help. It\u2019s just like how you manage the business. But if you think about cost, so far you\u2019ve been doing really well on margins. But there\u2019s also obviously an element of getting ready for things are getting better. How do you see the progression of investments this year? Thank you. Sandeep Aujla : Hey Raimo. Thanks for that question. Super important one, and let me share some of my thoughts. First and foremost, I\u2019ll start with the fact that we\u2019re deliberately building this business to scale growth while increasing our profitability. In fact, those are principle ones and two of our financial principles that we use to manage this company. So that\u2019s a very deliberate approach that we are taking. And we have a track record of expanding margin over the years while bringing innovation to markets such as Intuit Assist, such as building innovation to address the opportunity we have in the mid-market such as innovation to localize products in Mailchimp for the international market. So we are not leaving growth opportunities on the table with our focus to scale growth and drive innovation. Now, the second component of your question, in terms of the profitability profile so far this year, we look at our margins and aim to deliver our margin commitments for the full year. And I feel quite confident in our path to do so. And the performance we had in the first couple of quarters, in fact, bolster the confidence that I have in our full year guidance. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. So, Sasan, within the QuickBooks business you have this growth vector in the up market [ph], and I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re able to comment on the growth and traction that you\u2019re seeing in that 10 to 100 employee segment versus the one to nine or zero to nine employee segment. For instance is one of those growing mid-20s and the other is high teens just interested in how much of a spread you see there and maybe where you see it trending this year? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure. I\u2019ll add a perspective and would invite Sandeep to chime-in as well. I think the short answer is we are seeing more traction in our higher value customers and our mid-market customers, which I think to your frame is 10, 15 employees and up or more higher revenue customers. We are seeing more traction there, more momentum there. And by the way a big part of it is that\u2019s where we\u2019re really focusing our innovation, our go-to-market. At the same time to be clear we \u2013 we always remain paranoid and always believe in the notion of disrupting from the low end, which is by the way why we just launched a Solopreneur offering, which is to be able to serve those small businesses that in essence they\u2019re on their own. Because we believe that it\u2019s helping entrepreneurs when they\u2019re a team of one, because one-day some will become a team of thousands. So we\u2019re not taking our eye off the ball on the low-end at all, but we\u2019re doubling down on our focus on the higher value customers. And yes, we do see more resiliency, more momentum with these larger customers. Sandeep Aujla : And to covered the topic, the only thing I would add is that the unit economics on the upmarket is also something that we find quite attractive. These customers, they tend to scale to much higher ARPC especially as we get them to adopt our platform. They by definition have more employees. They by definition of processing more payments, so that\u2019s also something that we find attractive and is very much an area that we are having our go-to-market teams and our product teams deliberately lean in this year. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. Sandeep Aujla : Very welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Enders with Citi. Steve Enders : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess maybe just on the SMB side again; I think you made a comment in the prepared remarks about shifting towards ARPC over time as a growth lever. I guess one want to clarify that comment and then secondarily, does that change how you think about the levers of growth moving forward for the SMB segment, more towards ARPC, away from the customer side? Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks for the question, Steve. The way we think about it, and as we were just addressing in the prior question, we see tremendous opportunity in the mid-market for those that we currently define as having ten to 100 employees. And what really excites us about this opportunity is that these customers come with a much higher lifetime value, much higher ARPC, and have better retention. And so that just helps out our economics, but these customers also tend to have higher customer acquisition costs and there are relatively fewer of those than the smaller customers by definition, when you look at the overall addressable market. So as we focus on these larger customers, that means we will get higher ARPC per customer, even though there are fewer of those. So that is where the growth formula, we continue to abide by the growth formula that we have publicly discussed about 10% to 20% customer growth, 10% to 20% ARPC growth. But as we continue to focus on the mid market, you should expect us to lean in more towards the ARPC growth because of this dynamic with the mid-market, and that we think that\u2019s actually a good thing for the business going forward. Steve Enders : Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Sasan, a couple of task questions. One, we\u2019re three weeks in. We\u2019re pretty well through the early season. You had anticipated earlier, before the tax season that we would see a probably flattish year for the industry. And that felt kind of conservative. Now that we\u2019re in a bit and we\u2019ve also seen a return to DIY category shift, I\u2019m curious if you have any update on what you\u2019re seeing for the industry overall thus far. And then the second part is on full service. You sound very happy with it, the 88 number recommendation score. Could you speak to some of the growing pain points you had last year and the fixes you\u2019re seeing this year as you\u2019re working your way through the early season? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. Our view, having been through however many tax seasons we\u2019ve been through as a company, is it\u2019s early in the season to estimate how many folks will ultimately file when it\u2019s all said and done. With that said, our belief is still the same. It will probably be total of number of filers will probably flattish, maybe up a little bit. Our perspective really hasn\u2019t changed because our focus is how do we win as many filers within the category that are going to file. So the first answer is our view hasn\u2019t really changed. The second, on full service and some of the growing pains, I would call out a few from last year compared to what we\u2019re doing this year. One is, we actually made it difficult for customers to get into full service last year. And by the way, it was more trying to ensure the customers were really, really getting into the right service. But we had so much friction that we had created up front. And if you think about somebody that just walks into somebody\u2019s home or office and sort of hands everything over and says, here, get my taxes done. And then they interact until three or four weeks later until their taxes are done, the notion of engaging and putting a lot of friction up and asking a lot of questions up front is not a behavior they\u2019re used to. So that was a big learning and growing pain, a lot of which we have removed all the friction and engage \u2013 get a customer to engage an expert, depending on what we know about them, very, very early. So that\u2019s one. I think the second one, we learned a lot about what did and did not work in our campaigns last year. And there\u2019s a lot we are doing differently to really help customers, both on air, digitally, but also the infrastructure that we are working on, which, by the way, is not going to be done this season. Right. We\u2019re going to be investing in it for several years. Were basic things which, by the way, are very powerful, where if I did your taxes and you love the work that I did for you, and by the way, our product recommendation score of 88 would suggest that our experts are delivering excellent service. You\u2019d want to recommend me to your friend? Well, last year you could not do that. And this year we\u2019re building the capabilities that you could actually recommend me to a friend. And that virality is a very big thing, especially when you have an 88 product recommendation score. And then lastly is 43% of those that use an assisted method, that choose to switch to somebody else. 43% will actually go on Google and Google is there a tax pro near me? And again, that\u2019s another example of where we didn\u2019t have the infrastructure to show up and we\u2019re building that infrastructure. So I can tell you for a fact, in San Jose, California, right or in Los Gatos, I should say if you put in tax pro near me, we will show up top of the list. We being TurboTax. If you do it in Atlanta, which is where I was a few weeks ago, we don\u2019t show up because we\u2019re working on. So that\u2019s an example of the things that we learned last year that we\u2019re implementing this year, but not just for this tax season, but really to nail it with excellence as we think about the future. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. This one\u2019s for Sandeep as well. Another margin question, but a little bit of a different angle. When it comes to generative AI, we\u2019re really been talking a lot about the potential top line impacts. Are there operating margin benefits that you guys can see through? Just better usage of the GenAI technology internally, whether it\u2019s stuff like code assist or whatnot. And then on the flip side of the equation, given that a lot of this stuff is still ramping up. Is there anything we should be looking out for on the gross margin line in terms of just like these capabilities being that much more compute intensive and that much more impactful on COGS versus what you\u2019re seeing in consent assessment today? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Keith. So let me start by just reminding us all that the GenAI cost for the current fiscal year have been incorporated into our guidance. So that\u2019s first and foremost. But now let me address the themes of your question as I think about the cost structure, and I\u2019ll focus on the cost structure, since that\u2019s where your question was. We actually feel that we are quite advantageous versus the market in the sense that the data that we have, that we have touched on, that\u2019s residing behind our firewalls, that we are training our large language models on, that are delivering more contextually relevant answers at a faster speed versus other generally available large language models, and that they are doing that at a fraction of the cost. So just from a unit economics point of view, for the GenAI, it\u2019s actually advantageous the way we are running it. Two, we don\u2019t have our own data center, and we rely on AWS and other third party data centers to run our model. So that, again, is a cost advantage because we don\u2019t have that build out cost as some others might have. Furthermore, as I look across our business, I do see opportunities for us to, over time, improve our economics using GenAI and AI. Now, we\u2019ve already given examples on things such as in customer success, where agents no longer have to take notes or spend minutes summarizing the call that they just had. AI does that, and that\u2019s just one small example. But expect that to continue to lead to more efficiencies in a customer success calls lead to more better unit economics in a full service than live offerings, as you kind of carry that forward. Also, how we are staffing up builders in terms of project managers to designers to engineers ratios. So I see many opportunities for us to continue to benefit from GenAI, and I feel good about the early start that we have leaning into some of those capabilities. Keith Weiss : Got it. So, Net-net, it seems like a positive dynamic versus something that could drag on margins overall. Sasan Goodarzi : That would be the right takeaway, I guess. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer period. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Sasan Goodarzi : All right, awesome, everybody. Thank you for listening in. Thank you for your wonderful questions. Be safe. We\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Thank you, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Kim Watkins : Thanks, David. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. I\u2019m here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi, and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward- looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter with solid momentum across the company as we executed our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Third quarter revenue grew 12%. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% despite an uncertain macro environment, demonstrating the importance of our platform in fueling success for small businesses and our momentum serving the mid-market. Consumer Group revenue grew 9%, and Credit Karma revenue grew 8%, driven by the impact of innovation for members and the benefits of TurboTax and Credit Karma product integration. I\u2019m proud of our performance, and the momentum we are seeing across the company. Turning to tax. We continue to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses. Tax preparation represents a $35 billion TAM in the US. This includes $31 billion within the assisted consumer and business tax categories. We are well positioned to penetrate the assisted TAM by leveraging data, AI, and our Virtual Expert Platform. Let me share several proof points. This season we made good progress against our multi-year strategy to transform the assisted experience for customers. TurboTax Live, our assisted offering, including our do-it-with-me and full service tax offerings for both consumers and businesses is our largest durable growth opportunity. We expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 12% and revenue to grow 17% in fiscal 2024. TurboTax Live revenue is expected to be $1.4 billion, representing approximately 30% of total Consumer Group revenue growing at a significant scale. This gives us confidence that we can digitize a very manual, disaggregated, and high priced assisted category. Now let me spend a few minutes going deeper in several areas. First, TurboTax Live full service is resonating with consumers as we continue to innovate, making it simpler for customers to get their taxes done virtually. We expect TurboTax Live full service customers to double this fiscal year, with those new to TurboTax to triple. Our full service offering has a product recommendation score of 85, one of the highest at Intuit. Our learnings and insights from this season bolster our confidence in the continued opportunity we have to disrupt the assisted tax category. Second, we expect TurboTax to gain share with higher ARPR filers, as we strategically prioritized focusing on the assisted tax segment and higher value customers over the pay-nothing and lower ARPR segment. Third, Intuit Assist, our GenAI powered financial assistant, played a big role in our TurboTax experience this year. With Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of done for you, where the hard work is done automagically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. More than 24 million customers used Intuit Assist to explain their refund, answer questions, and help deliver confidence that their return was completed accurately this year. This is data and GenAI working at scale, for both our customers and our AI powered experts helping customers virtually. I\u2019m excited about what we are working on for next season to accelerate innovation and deliver even more customer benefits. And fourth, we delivered solid results with the product integration across Credit Karma and TurboTax. We grew the number of customers that filed with TurboTax from the embedded Credit Karma experience by 76%, and tax refunds deposited in a Credit Karma Money account by 28%. We also delivered strong growth in Credit Karma Money revenue this quarter. This product integration also drove new members to Credit Karma, consistent with our goal of driving higher engagement and monetization for Credit Karma over time. Given these results, we see big opportunities ahead to deliver on our vision to help consumers make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save more, pay off debt, and take steps to improve their financial health. To significantly accelerate creating seamless, end-to-end consumer experiences that customers benefit from year-round, we are more closely aligning TurboTax and Credit Karma under Mark Notarainni, General Manager of the Consumer Group, who will oversee both segments. I\u2019m excited to share that Joe Kauffman, currently President of Credit Karma and part of the leadership team for the last nine years, will be leading Credit Karma as of August 1, reporting to Mark. Additionally, Ken Lin will retire from Intuit around the end of this calendar year. I can\u2019t thank Ken enough for his friendship, leadership, and impact across Intuit. In summary, we made strong progress this tax season that sets us up for continued success in the future. Now, let\u2019s take a look ahead. The era of AI is one of the most significant technology shifts of our lifetime. It is reinventing customer experiences, creating new monetization possibilities, and structurally changing how we work within Intuit to deliver for customers. We are very well positioned to take advantage of this era with our AI-driven expert platform strategy and five Big Bets that pursue the largest customer problems and growth drivers for Intuit. As part of our financial planning process, we have identified key areas within our Big Bets where we plan to accelerate investments to deliver greater impact. These include : Big Bet 1 GenAI to deliver done- for-you experiences with Intuit Assist, Big Bet 2 go-to-market investments for TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, embedding AI powered experts across our small business offerings, Big Bet 4, our money solutions, to digitize the experience end-to-end for consumers and small businesses, from estimate, to invoicing, to getting paid and paying bills, Big Bet 5, doubling down on mid-market with additional investments in the platform and go-to-market motions; and finally, accelerating international growth with Mailchimp and QuickBooks. To increase our investments in the outlined focus areas given the green shoots we are observing, we are taking a hard look at what work we can stop doing and where we can reallocate investments, to accelerate top line growth while remaining committed to delivering operating margin expansion in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Wrapping up, we are excited about the opportunity ahead, and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep. Sandeep Aujla : Thanks, Sasan. We delivered a solid third quarter of fiscal 2024 across the company. Our third quarter results include, revenue of $6.7 billion, up 12%. GAAP operating income of $3.1 billion, versus $2.8 billion last year, up 12%. Non-GAAP operating income of $3.7 billion, versus $3.4 billion last year, up 11%%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $8.42, versus $7.38 a year ago, up 14%. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $9.88, versus $8.92 last year, up 11%. Now turning to the business segments. Consumer group revenue of $3.7 billion grew 9% in Q3, reflecting the progress we made transforming the assisted experience for consumers and small businesses this season. Our strategy is working. We expect TurboTax Live revenue to grow 17% to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2024, representing approximately 30% of overall Consumer Group revenue, driving total average revenue per return up approximately 10%. I\u2019m pleased with the sustained growth we\u2019re seeing in our TurboTax Live business. Overall retention is expected to be up 3 points year-over-year in fiscal 2024, close to pre-COVID levels, demonstrating the strength of our offerings and highlighting the benefits we are delivering to our customers. As Sasan shared earlier, we expect TurboTax to gain share with higher ARPR filers, as we strategically prioritized focusing on the assisted tax and higher ARPR customers over the pay-nothing and lower ARPR segment. As a result, we expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 12% and total online paying units to grow approximately 2% in fiscal 2024, versus total IRS returns growth of 1%. Due to yielding share with pay-nothing and lower ARPR customers, we expect our share of total consumer returns to decline approximately 80 basis points this year, and total TurboTax units to decline 1%. We are raising our full year Consumer Group revenue growth guidance to $4.440 billion to $4.455 billion, which is at the top end of our previously provided guidance. I\u2019m proud of the progress we made this season, and the learnings we had reinforce our confidence in the future. We continue to expect Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long-term given the size and trajectory of TurboTax Live. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue grew 3% in the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect ProTax Group revenue growth of 6% to 7%. Turning to the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. The revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem revenue which grew 19%. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold, grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 19% in Q3, driven by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix-shift. As I shared last quarter, we continue to prioritize disrupting the small business mid-market, through continued focus on both go-to-market motions and product innovations. Mid-market customers drive a higher ARPC over time given their more complex needs and higher usage of services on our platform, although they are a smaller subset of the total customer TAM. This, coupled with our strategy to sell more of our ecosystem offerings to existing customers, shifts the emphasis in our growth formula towards ARPC over time. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 20% in Q3, driven by payments, payroll, and Mailchimp. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects higher effective prices, ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow, and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Total online payment volume growth in Q3 was 22%. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions, higher effective prices, and a mix-shift towards higher end offerings. Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. Revenue growth in Mailchimp decelerated this quarter, as we were lapping a larger benefit from price and line-up changes that we made last year. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and line-up. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q3. Shifting to the Desktop Ecosystem. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 14% in the third quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the high-teens. At the end of this fiscal year, we will complete the three-year transition for customers that remain on our license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. As I shared last quarter, starting next fiscal year, we expect our Desktop Enterprise offering, which accounts for over half of desktop accounting revenue, to grow in the high-single digit range. We also will continue to encourage remaining Desktop Plus subscription customers, who tend to be more complex and higher value, to migrate seamlessly to either QBO or our Desktop Enterprise offering when they are ready. Additionally, we see opportunities to continue to price the product for value. The online ecosystem remains our growth catalyst longer-term. As a result of the strong growth we are seeing in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, we are raising our full year segment revenue growth guidance to 18%, up from the prior guidance of 16% to 17%. We continue to expect Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 15% to 20% long-term. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $443 million in Q3, up 8%. On a product basis, Credit Karma Money accounted for 3 points of growth, credit cards and auto insurance each accounted for 2 points, and personal loans accounted for 1 point. We saw strength in Credit Karma Money from TurboTax customers choosing to deposit their refund in a Credit Karma Money account, and we are seeing a return to growth in the insurance segment. However, the overall picture remains mixed, reflecting uncertain macro trends as we continued to see select partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards in Q3. We are updating our full year Credit Karma revenue growth guidance to a growth of 2%, versus our prior guidance range of plus or minus 3% growth. In summary, I\u2019m pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year and our opportunities ahead. Shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions, they remain our long-term commitment, and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.7 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $584 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on July 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, we are increasing our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes, total company revenue growth of 13%, up from prior guidance of 11% to 12% growth; GAAP operating income growth of 21% to 22%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 18% growth; non-GAAP operating income growth of 16%, up from prior guidance of 12% to [16%] (ph) growth; GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 28% to 29%, up from prior guidance of 11% to 15% growth; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 17%, up from prior guidance of 12% to 14% growth. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 includes, revenue growth of 13% to 14%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.25 to $0.30, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.85. You can find our full fiscal 2024 and Q4 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. Finally, as Sasan shared earlier, we have made strong progress on our five Big Bets and see opportunities to invest further in select focus areas to accelerate our pace of progress and deliver greater impact. Therefore, as part of our annual financial planning process, we are taking a hard look at reallocating investments. We remain committed to our financial principles, growing revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster -- slower than revenue, leading to expanding operating margin in fiscal 2025 and beyond. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Sandeep. Let me close with three points. First, we're very well positioned to take advantage of the largest technological shifts of our era given Intuit strategy and five Big Bets with AI at the center as all we do. Second, given the green shoots we're observing, we are doubling down in key areas of our bets to accelerate growth. Third, we continue to recruit great technical and leadership talent across the company to accelerate our progress. In that context, I'd like to share that Greg Johnson recently returned as Executive Vice President, Intuit, Chief Commercial Officer and Global Small Business & Self-Employed Group Chief Revenue Officer. Greg is a world-class leader with nearly 10 years of experience at Intuit, leading TurboTax as the Head of Marketing and then as General Manager. I'm thrilled to have Greg back in Intuit. Now let's open it up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And a really nice quarter in that, you guys really flexed the ability to use the portfolio to outperform on the top line and outperform on the bottom line. And in what has been a pretty difficult earnings season actually taking earnings up we hear your full year EPS is coming off. So that's all great to see. I wanted to ask about the tax business overall. The shift towards kind of the high end, the higher ARPC customers seems more pronounced this year probably than what I was expecting, and I think most people were expecting. I think the underlying question most investors have is like, why can\u2019t we do both right? Why can\u2019t we price for the low end and get those customers on board as well as attracting those higher ARPC customers? Is that available to you? Or do you need to be shifting more upmarket? Sasan Goodarzi : Hey, Keith, thank you very much for the complement and your question. Let me address your question in a couple of ways. First of all, I'll start with some of what we already shared, but it's important context in that we're really bullish in terms of what we saw with TurboTax Live going after the assisted segment because now you have a $1.4 billion business growing at 17%. And with that being 30% of the total TurboTax franchise, when we flip that over to, now it becomes 50%, 60% of the franchise, it really accelerates the growth of the entire TurboTax franchise. And what we demonstrated this year, I would almost say for the first time is, we moved the needle of taking share and assisted. When you look at the fact that -- although IRS grew 1%, most of that growth all happened in DIY, mainly with sort of three simple filer customers, assisted was flat, and that's where we took share. And I think that is a first sort of time of a sign that we're starting to build a flywheel effect that gives us a lot of confidence as we look into the future. I think the second thing that I would say is we -- because of our Credit Karma and TurboTax platform, we actually see the customers that are just really looking for a free tax software and are bouncing between platforms, and we are not interested in those customers. We're not interested in pursuing those customers, the cost of acquisition to get those customers when they simply are bouncing between platforms. We're really focused on quality of the customers, particularly because now we've just scratched the service in the assisted segment and what really matters is now accelerating the share take in the assisted segment. So that's really how we're thinking about it and what gives us confidence in not only what we delivered, but particularly in the future. Keith Weiss : Got it. Makes sense. Thanks so much guys. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just actually want to expand on the comments you've made on. So on one hand, you talked about focusing more on sort of the higher end of the market, but you're also talking about deepening the integration between Credit Karma and TurboTax in the future. And so can you just maybe expand a little bit more, especially around the Credit Karma and TurboTax integration, what we should be expecting going forward? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, absolutely. This year, particularly, we're very excited about what we saw and actually what didn't work. And let me, if I could, hit on both. First and foremost, Credit Karma has over 40 million monthly active users and a larger chunk of those 40 million plus active users are actually doing their taxes using the assisted method. And so that's an enormous opportunity for us. This year, we embedded the TurboTax experience within Credit Karma, and we're very aggressive pursuing those customers. And in fact, we drove traffic north of $10 million within Credit Karma, those that were interested in doing their taxes with TurboTax. That's why it resulted in a 76% growth of the number of TurboTax customers that use the embedded experience within Credit Karma. At the same time, what we are constructively dissatisfied are two very basic things that did not work well this year. One with seamless log in, the second was performance of the app. And what I mean by seamless log in is, out of those 10 million-plus customers that were in the bucket of traffic, about 25% of them when they click to start doing their taxes with us or have us do it for them, they didn't have any instruction. They could just get started right away, where 75% of them could not. There was a lot of friction. And that was just an element of time. We were not able to get to all the work that was required to get everyone to experience, in essence, no log in. And that's a big deal, and we're all over it already. The second is performance of the app. We worked very hard to embed the TurboTax experience within Credit Karma, but the performance of the app was not where it needs to be. When I say performance of the app, some of the time that it took was like eight to seven seconds just for the app to be able to load. That's unacceptable, and we saw a lot of drop off. Both of those are in our control. Both of those, we are already working on. But I share that as an example of -- we saw a huge green shoot with our focus this year on every Credit Karma member becoming a TurboTax customer. And there's two very basic things that we're constructively dissatisfied with that gives us actually a lot of confidence as we look into the future. So hopefully, that answers your question. Daniel Jester : That\u2019s great. Thanks for the context. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. And Sasan, I want to ask about your vision and strategy for the Money platform. I have a multipart question there. We have seen you expanded invoice to bill pay. Would love to get your progress so far, any feedback there in the last couple of quarters. But also, we saw that you recently acquired Proper Finance and also made some hiring -- senior executive hiring in the money platform side. So I'd love to hear your strategy in which direction it's going in a money platform. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure, Siti, thank you for the question. Let me actually talk about the focus around money on two dimensions that we're very, very excited about. And as you also heard in our prepared remarks, this is an area where we are accelerating our investments. We are seeing a lot of green shoots with all the work that we've been doing in the last several years, really digitizing the whole process of estimating invoicing to getting paid and having multiple paying options along with the bill pay capabilities that we've built that we are now rolling out to our customers. We're seeing a lot of green shoots in both of those areas. You saw in a pretty tough macro environment. Our payments overall total payments volume was up 22%, and that's an area where we're accelerating our investment. That's on the small business side. The thing that we're also excited about is money focused across the TurboTax Credit Karma platform. We saw a lot of green shoots this year with a 20% or 28% increase of the number of customers that put their refund on a Credit Karma Money account. We're excited about it, not because of the 28%. We actually believe that could be far bigger. But because of the areas of friction that we are going to remove and the fact that we have opportunities to give much earlier access to their tax refund and actually monetize it. So those are the two areas across our small business and consumer platform that we are focused on and we're accelerating our investments across both of those platforms in the coming year. Sandeep Aujla : And Siti on the acquisition, you mentioned, as we've shared with you in the past, we are continually looking at by the partner, and that was a small technology tuck-in that we did to build some of the core money movement and risk management capabilities within our small business group. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alex Markgraff with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open. Alex Markgraff : Great. Thank you for taking my questions, Sasan. Just one for you on TurboTax. Just looking at recent Investor Day slides and sort of the long-term growth framework for the business. When we look at this total TurboTax share of IRS returns, I think implies sort of a positive share gain over the long term. And I'm just curious, I understand the focus in the assisted category. Should we be thinking about that input differently as it relates to total IRS returns going forward, just given what we're seeing at the lower end of the spectrum? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Alex, great question. Let me just -- one minute of context, and then I'll answer your question. Based on our estimates, we believe the IRS total returns will grow about 1%. And the majority of that, if not all of that will happen in the do-it-yourself category. The assisted category is generally flat, which is why we led with the fact that we are taking share. With that as context, it actually does not change our long-term goal post of we want to be able to increase share of total IRS returns. We also want to get there in the right way. So this year, I'm very comfortable with where we ended up because our entire focus was the assisted segment and high value, high average revenue per return filers. But over time, as TurboTax Live goes from being 30% of our franchise, growing at 17% to being 70% of our franchise. So that's when you're going to see us start moving the needle on increasing our share of the total IRS returns. And by the way, I would also liken this, although it's not directly at your question, I would liken this to the online desktop mix, if you think about the last five to 10 years in small business. We always said that once online becomes more than 50% of small business and then 60% and 70% over time because it's growing faster, it will actually accelerate the growth rate of the small business group. That is exactly what's happened. And we believe that same thing will happen in TurboTax as TurboTax Live goes from 30% to 70% one day, and that's what will result in our total share increasing of total IRS. Alex Markgraff : Okay. Thank you. Sandeep Aujla : One other point of context, if I may add, Alex, that's important to understand that even on the simple filers, there is a customer segmentation that is critical for us to keep in mind. We are -- we remain focused on the simple filers through both TurboTax and Credit Karma, but we are not focused on are the simple filers that have a higher propensity to change platforms year after year because we frankly don't think those -- that's a good return on our investment, and there's no opportunity for us to grow and earn revenue there. So I just want to make sure that customer segmentation was also pronounced in what you were hearing. Alex Markgraff : Understood. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Yeah, thanks very much. Sasan, can you just touch upon Mailchimp a little bit? I was kind of curious what your thought is for the business into the back half of the year, given the fact that I think some people think on the small business side, cutting back on sort of go-to-market is often a place they might look to trim. Can you just talk about sort of what you're seeing there? And what gives you confidence that perhaps this is an opportunity for you guys to take share in that area? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Great question. First of all, I'll reiterate what you heard from us earlier. The fact that the revenue decelerated was primarily because we're lapping a big price increase and some lineup changes from last year. The fundamental health of the business is consistent with what it was last quarter. So that's number one. Number two, our durable focus remains the same, which is -- we are integrating Mailchimp and QuickBooks. I'd be happy to talk about that more, if there are questions about it, two, mid-market, third, international. And we're being really very aggressive in international. In fact, I was just most recently in London, spent time with our new leader in Mailchimp that leads EMEA, that came from another company where he has built a really a large international business, and two, visited a number of customers and partners, and we're being very aggressive with our approach in what we've done with the platform, what we're doing with our pricing and then the marketing investments that we are making as we look ahead. And in fact, as I mentioned earlier, there are five areas where we are accelerating our investment. This is one of them. And so we're quite excited about the possibilities given the green shoots that we're seeing. Kirk Materne : Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Very welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. Sasan, you still remain the best predictor of small business. You've got the best read. And I'm curious what -- you said green shoots, I speak by that observation. And in a macro environment, which gets tougher, you guys have shown the ability to execute really well. So what are the other things in your toolkit that you have been able to unpack that if the macro environment continues to stay where it is? One of the things that could help them to continue to outperform these expectations for the small business segment. Thank you so much and congrats. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you, and great to hear from you. The -- one of our fundamental execution philosophies that we have at the company is conviction on the long-term, ambitious testing and experimentation in the short term so that we can be nimble, we can learn and we can adjust. And really, the answer to your question is the five areas that you heard that we're accelerating our investments. I mean we are seeing green shoots with our learnings and insights with Intuit Assist, and we're accelerating our investments in GenAI. We -- as I talked about earlier, for the first time, we were increasing our share in the assisted segment. And so we're accelerating a number of areas with TurboTax Live. We are also embedding an expert within QuickBooks Live, within our entire small business platform where every offering will actually come with an embedded expert because we believe, based on green shoots that we've seen, that will improve conversion, it will also improve retention. And mid-market, I mean, we have been really assertive in building out capabilities in the platform. We have been asserted in building out our customer-facing capabilities from leadership all the way down to our frontline sales folks, and we're seeing great green shoots there to accelerate not only growing with our customers, but I'm hunting for new ones. And as you know, mid-market is not just about getting the customers, it's all the services that comes with the it, payments, payroll, live platform capability. So, Kash, those are the, I would say, key green shoots that we are seeing, all of which we are accelerating our investments currently, by the way, in the quarter and as we head into next year. Kash Rangan : Fantastic. Thanks. Glad to hear that. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Tanks very much. Sasan, as you sort of think about the overall economic environment, you did a great job there with Kash's question. But for the first time, I think, as long as you provided the data, payroll wasn't the number one growth driver on the online ecosystem. So maybe you can dig in there and give us a little sort of color on what's going on within the payroll business and if we should expect growth to continue to moderate there. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Well, let me start actually with the -- what we're seeing on our platform with respect to the health of small businesses, if I could just do that for a moment. One of the things that we are seeing, if we look back from today versus the last three to four months, we're actually seeing some improvement in profitability of small businesses on our platform. And that's a good sign compared to the last couple of years. Now within that, the -- depending on the sector that you're in, your performance is driven by the environment. And so for instance, manufacturing -- areas like manufacturing, professional services, auto repair, their profits are actually up nearly 20%, where real estate lending, their profits are actually down 15%. So the net of it is overall, we've seen improvement, depending on the sector you're in, your performance varies. But the net of all of that is that cash reserves are down 8% compared to this time last year, but up over 16% compared to pre-COVID. So what you should take away is small businesses are healthier but their cash reserves have been impacted. And for those that are on our platform, by the way, over four years, their cash reserves are over 60% higher than those that have only been with us for a year. Last thing I would just say is hours worked is actually up compared to the last quarter. Specific to your payroll question, let me ask Sandeep to answer specifically what you asked about payroll. Sandeep Aujla : Brad, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we continue to see customers in our payroll business, adopting our solutions. They continue to take our higher-end offerings as well. The reason for the difference you called out is, I'll point to the payments business where the charge volume went to 22% growth in the quarter versus 20% the prior quarter. So that's the key item to call out in that sequencing. Brad Reback : Perfect. Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Very welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the question. Sasan, it's great to hear about the strong performance in full service this season. Can you double-click into which assisted filers, you feel you did a good job capturing, which might have been a little bit more resistant than your expectations? And how do you think about driving momentum in full service going forward? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Brad, great question. I was actually in San Diego all day yesterday with the TurboTax team doing deep dives on all of these durable priorities. One of them was full service. First of all, I would tell you that across all of the states, across different income levels, across all complexities, very consistent. And I would say that if you heard -- not if you heard, if you reflect back on what I said in the remarks, that our new customers in full service tripled, an outsized element of that was those that are sort of younger, the millennials, and they are actually embracing full service as a cohort more than others, not by an incredible amount, but it stands out for us. So I think what we learned -- and that's a big deal by the way. What we learned is, we were successful just in one area. But I'll tell you the biggest area we are constructively dissatisfied when you look at our overall assisted performance. We were very aggressive with our go-to-market and not just spend but the beginnings of being able to recommend an expert, the beginnings of when you search for a local expert us showing up. There's a lot of infrastructure that we built. We drive a lot of traffic to our front doors. Where we are constructively dissatisfied is, we have to work on our shopping experience. When you walk into somebody's firm, a store or somebody's home to have them do your taxes for you, you're not presented with a set of SKUs. You just go in there and you exchange documents and they do their taxes for you. Our shopping experience has to be improved. That's where we saw the biggest drop off. So what we have a lot of confidence in is the demand that we created. And by the way, the performance. But the demand that we created was exceptional. We need to get better at the shopping experience. It's one of the areas where -- by the way we saw this during the season, and there's a lot of work that's being done to actually leverage AI to personalize the experiences so that when we get a customer that comes in, that comes from an assisted method, they're actually greeted by an expert versus greeted with which SKU do you want to pick. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much for the color, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Very welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Enders with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Enders : Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess maybe I just want to start on -- or want to ask about the AI and the assistant or the AI Intuit Assist solution that's now out of market. I guess -- what are kind of the proof points that you've seen? Or how is it kind of manifesting in kind of improving experience or driving monetizable outcomes for Intuit so far? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Steve, thank you for the question. I'm actually pleased with our progress, and I'll share some of the proof points, and I will also just remind us, we're still in the early days, but a lot has changed in the last three months. So let me share what those are. First of all, in TurboTax, 24 million customers used Intuit Assist to better understand the refund outcome and be able to get their questions answered. And not just the customer but Intuit Assist help our experts be much more efficient and effective in helping our customers. And as you can imagine, we would not have rolled that out to 24 million folks if that wasn't accretive to conversion. The second is Credit Karma. In Credit Karma, we have over 40 million monthly active users, and we have rolled out Intuit Assist capabilities, and I'll share what those are in a moment, to nearly half of our 40 million monthly active users. And what we have rolled out are the following things : one, to help you make a decision. And so by the way, if any of you on the call are Credit Karma users, and you happen to have iOS, unless you are in a holdout cell, you'll be able to see everything that I am articulating. So you will see things like Intuit Assist that we'll show you see why, see comparisons, let me help you. And when you engage, it helps you actually understand and have a conversation about which card is right for you. In the past, we always were able to use your data to deliver personalized experiences for you. In this case, personalized cards that are right for you, but now we can have a conversation with you and help you understand why one is better than the other. That's one huge element. The other is help you make financial decisions, help you understand how to build your credit, help you understand how to better save money, help you understand which cards are best to use and which cards you should reduce your utilization. That's what we've rolled out. And again, as you can imagine, we would not have rolled that out to almost 20 million Credit Karma members if it wasn't accretive to better monetization. And then the last couple of examples that I would use is on the small business side, where Mailchimp, nearly 300,000 customers have Intuit Assist available to them, particularly and specifically around personalized marketing campaigns, where you can -- where we help you put a campaign together, images, text, et cetera. And in -- across the QuickBooks platform, we have capabilities available to nearly 30,000-ish customers. And the capability is really about turning unstructured data into money and personalized feed. What that means is taking your e-mail as an example, and taking everything that's in your e-mail and turning it into an invoice that's paid and labeled so that you can get paid faster, and that's a monetizable event for us. And then business feeds that helps you orient to what's most important insight for the day, which ultimately depending on what you engage with is a monetizable event for us. So we've made a lot of progress in the last 90 days. And we're even more hopeful about what's possible in the future. I'll just end with -- it's early days, but it's amazing the progress that the team has made in the last 90 days. Steve Enders : Great to hear. Thanks for the context there. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, very welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around TurboTax Full Service. I know it's been a couple of seasons now under your belt here. What are some of the areas that you've learned from? What are some of the areas you've outperformed with full service. What are some of the learnings from a couple of tax seasons now under your belt? And what have you identified for the future in order to target that segment more aggressively? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Brad, thank you for your question. First of all, I would say, this actually was the first real season with full service. Last year, it was still -- although we rolled that out, it was still at the experiment level. With that said, to answer your question, a couple of things. One, because we were quite aggressive with our go-to-market, we learned that we can create a lot of demand. And we created a lot of demand not only by talking about the fact that we can do your taxes in less than a day, we can help extend your money and give you early access or immediate access to your money. But there is a lack of price transparency in the entire assisted segment, where you don't really know what you're going to pay until you walk into somebody's store or a firm. And we did a lot of testing to understand how important price is. We learned that it matters a lot. And so we created a lot of demand. That's number one. Number two, when you search locally for an expert or -- and/or if we showed you in when you engage with full services, there's an expert near you, the conversion rates were significantly higher than when we didn't so up in search. And that, by the way, is just an element of time. We'll be able to get all of what we were doing this year rolled out across all of our customers. But that's an enormous learning that local matters. People want to be able to search for pro-near-me, folks want to know that their expert is nearby, and we saw a significant expert or conversion lift. Last thing that we saw as a great proof point is, I think this was more towards the middle, towards the end of season, you could recommend your expert. That had a big conversion one. But we were not able to scale that for the entire season or to all of our customers, which we plan to do next year. So those are the big insights and the big learnings. And last, I'll just end with the following, which is what I mentioned a moment ago, we have a lot of work to do on our shopping experience. And to simply put it, when you walk into somebody's firm or a store, you're not presented with a SKU in a lineup. You just walk in and get -- have them get your taxes done. And that's what we are working on, which is, in essence, when you pick full service, you're greeted by the expert versus a pricing lineup to make a choice. And that with an enormous learning this year, all of which we're currently working on for next year that give us a lot of confidence. Brad Sills : Very clear. Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Sasan, this is primarily on TurboTax and on do-it-yourself in TurboTax. I think, I heard Sandeep say that overall consumer retention or TurboTax retention was 3 points yet there was some share loss, obviously, on the low end and seemingly in do-it-yourself. The full service metrics and overall TurboTax Live sound great. So I think you have good retention there, good new customer acquisition. But in the do-it-yourself in the paid customer, are you doing okay in share there? And what are you doing in that category specifically paid, do-it-yourself to build-share going forward. Because when you answered Alex's question earlier about growing share, it sounds like all like in the assisted category, and that's great. It's a great opportunity. Just curious, in the paid categories, what your opportunities are going forward? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you for the question. And Sandeep, please feel fear to build. I would say that overall, we feel good about our paid share because if you -- and we cut it multiple different ways internally. But if you look at what we've shared in our remarks, total IRS grew 1%. Our total paying customers grew 2%, and our retention grew 3 points. So we actually feel good about our paying share. I think what you heard us remark on is, where we lost share, which we're okay with because it was actually an intentional focus on the things that we've talked about today, was on customers that are, in essence, simple filers that are bouncing between platforms. And that's the area where we articulated earlier that we lost share. So that's the way I would have you think about our performance is when it comes to paying share, we actually feel good about our performance. Sandeep Aujla : Scott, I would also add that you should have not take away that we are yielding any ground on the paying of DIY customers. Our marketing investments, we are focused on attracting both customers to our platform. Our experiences are helping those customers better understand their returns and gain better confidence leading to better conversion. And we remain relentlessly focused on improving our product experience for those customers. So in addition to the assisted category, which we are excited to disrupt the $31 billion market across consumer and small business, we also are focused on taking share. It was a paying DIY customer. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thank you both. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re very welcome, Scott. Operator : We will take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Sasan, you talked earlier in the prepared remarks about desktop and the changes here in the coming year. Can you kind of link that up maybe a little bit is what we've seen in QuickBooks Advanced? And how -- if there's kind of more opportunity to bring desktop guys over and what you're seeing here on board? Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. Let me -- thank you for the question. And let me answer your question, but if I'm not answering your question directly, please come at me again. I think what you heard us talk about earlier is, one, we've been in the middle of a business model shift moving all of our desktop customers to subscription. And at the same time, we've been building capabilities on our online platform. So eventually, all of our desktop customers have a destination, which is online. And we believe, over time, all of our desktop customers at one point will be on our online platform. With that said, the thing that I would say is that we've really built out a lot of our capabilities on QuickBooks Advanced. And in fact, we are aggressively building a number of capabilities that we'll be excited to talk to all of you about at Investor Day, really targeting even larger customers. And I think we'll be far better positioned to take on some of our larger enterprise customers that may choose to want to come to our online platform. And that's really the essence of what we were talking about earlier. As you think about our desktop franchise looking ahead, one, we have desktop enterprise that's growing high single digits. Number two, we view that we can get most of our customers over time to go to our online platform and price to value also plays an important role. And with all that said, I just think we're better positioned for some of our larger customers that come to our QB Advanced over time. And that's what really gives us confidence as we look into the future. Sandeep Aujla : No, I was just going to add, the question was also about just the progress we are feeling about Advanced. What I would say across the mid-market and as I alluded in my prepared remarks, we continue to feel good about the progress we're making with the mid-market, including with QuickBooks Online Advanced and with the desktop enterprise product, which grew in the in the high teens. So that's an area we continue to feel good about, the add I would have. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Welcome. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Daniela on for Taylor. Thanks for taking my question. So it looks like the Small Business & Self-Employed growth in the quarter was run by stable to our accounting growth and an acceleration in that stock. So as we look into 4Q, how much of the implied 17% for Small Business & Self-Employed growth is being driven by desktop versus stability in the online segment? And given that so many SMB software companies saw incremental pressure in 1Q, can you just comment on what you're seeing in terms of SMP Health and how that is influencing your guide? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, sure. Let me get us started. Sandeep, please jump in if you have any perspective to add. I'm not sure I understood the premise of your question, so let me just share what you should take away. What you should take away is the strength of our small business franchise is being driven by our online performance. Overall, it grew 18% or our online actually grew 19%, our services grew 20% and we actually feel very good about the trajectory of the business. And as we talked about, as we look ahead, we believe that desktop will continue to grow once the business model shift comes to an end, but that continued growth will come from the fact that half of desktop is enterprise, and it's growing high -- we anticipate it to grow high single digits. But the takeaway should be that in a macro environment, that is somewhat uncertain. Our online performance for small business has been quite strong, very resilient, and we're actually seeing a lot of engagement and usage by our customers just because it's really helping them manage their cash flow. It's helping them grow their business, and I think we're very well positioned in this environment. Sandeep Aujla : And what I would add, in addition to Sasan's comments about the health of the SMB market is a reminder that 80% of our small business group's revenue is subscription-based. And when you look at those businesses, the part of that is not related to subscription, largely on our services side. Couple of factors just to underline, we saw our payments charge volume increased 22% in Q3, which was faster than what we saw in Q2. And we continue to see good adoption of our payroll offerings by customers as well as a mix shift towards the high end of payroll offerings. So heading into Q4, we feel good about our online ecosystem growth, which remains our growth catalyst going into the future. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Turrin : Hey, great. Thanks. Appreciate you fitting me on. The small business segment growth is holding in strong if we look at the international online ecosystem revenue growth, trailing at 12% in constant currency. Sasan, are there plays you see to potentially jump-start overseas growth? Is there anything you're experimenting with around Mailchimp that could help with tip of the spear there into broader international reach? Or what else do you see that yield potentially better growth down the line? Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you for your question. First of all, I'll start with the fact that the Mailchimp lapping price increase from last year and some of the lineup changes that we talked about earlier impacts international growth, just since 50% of Mailchimp's revenue is international. So that was a big driver of why 12%. And two, yes, absolutely, given the green shoots that we are seeing with Mailchimp internationally and where we have product market fit with QuickBooks and Mailchimp, one of the five areas that we are accelerating our investments is, in fact, international. So we're excited about what's possible as we look at. Michael Turrin : Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, very welcome. Operator : I'll now turn the program back to our speakers for any closing remarks. I do apologize. We will actually take our next question. I apologize again. We were going to take our question from Alex Zukin, but they have removed themselves from the queue. I will return the call to our speakers for any closing remarks. Sasan Goodarzi : Well, listen, everybody, thank you so much for attending. Thank you for your wonderful questions, and we will see you at our next earnings. Be safe. Bye-bye. Operator : This does conclude today's progress. Thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Ms. Kim Watkins, Intuit\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Watkins. Kim Watkins : Thanks, Bo. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. I\u2019m here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi, and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla. Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We delivered very strong results for the fourth quarter and full-year, and made meaningful progress with our AI-driven expert platform strategy and Big Bets that position the company for durable growth in the future. Our full-year revenue grew 13% and we delivered strong operating margin expansion demonstrating the strength and momentum of our investments and innovation. As we exit the year, we are confident in delivering another year of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion in fiscal year 2025. Intuit is the global AI-driven expert platform that is powering prosperity for consumers, small and mid-market businesses. Our strategy and five Big Bets position Intuit as a mission critical platform that delivers end-to-end solutions, driving sustained growth. We made an early bet on AI. We have a significant advantage with the scale of our data, investments in AI capabilities such as knowledge engineering, machine learning, and GenAI, and our large network of AI-powered virtual experts. This is enabling us to disrupt the categories in which we operate. We are transforming how we serve our customers by delivering done-for-you experiences, where we do the hard work for them, connecting them with AI-powered human expertise to fuel their success. With the introduction of GenAI, we are now delivering reimagined customer experiences and bolstering businesses' growth potential, while driving efficiencies in how work gets done within Intuit. This has enabled us to build our large AI-driven expert platform to fuel the success of consumers, small and mid-market businesses. The progress we've made has bolstered our confidence, leading us to accelerate investments in five key areas within our Big Bets to deliver greater impact in the future. I\u2019ll spend a moment unpacking the progress we\u2019ve made and our investment plans for the future : First, within Big Bet 1, we are delivering done-for-you experiences with Intuit Assist. In fiscal year 2024, we made strong progress making Intuit Assist, our GenAI-powered financial assistant, available to millions of consumers and approximately 1 million small and mid-market businesses. We are accelerating our investments to rollout Intuit Assist at scale in the coming year. Second, within Big Bet 2, we are accelerating platform and go-to-market investments for TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, embedding AI-powered experts across our business offerings. In fiscal year 2024, TurboTax Live revenue grew 17%, and full-service customers doubled while those new to TurboTax tripled. QuickBooks Live customers more than tripled. We expect our accelerated investment in these areas to deepen our penetration in very manual, high-priced, and dis-aggregated assisted categories. By digitizing how services are delivered, an integral part of our done-for-you platform experiences, we will become the AI-powered financial assistant for consumers, small and mid-market businesses. Next, within Big Bet 4, our money solutions, we are making additional investments to accelerate digitizing the experience end-to-end for consumers, small and mid-market businesses, from estimate, to invoicing, to getting paid and paying bills. In fiscal year 2024, the total online payment volume we facilitated on our platform grew 20%. We also helped small businesses access $2.4 billion in financing through QuickBooks Capital, up 28%, and we made significant progress digitizing B2B payments with our bill pay offering, for which monthly payment volume processed quadrupled over the last six months. In fiscal year 2025, we expect these accelerated investments to deliver best-in-class, seamless payments, capital, banking, bill pay, and invoicing solutions. Next, within Big Bet 5, we are doubling down on mid-market with additional investments in the platform and go-to-market motions. In fiscal year 2024, QBO Advanced customers grew 28%. In fiscal year 2025, we are accelerating investments to better serve customers who have more complex needs, such as more sophisticated accounting and reporting requirements, business intelligence, money solutions, human capital management, professional services, and customer acquisition solutions with Mailchimp, all assisted by AI-powered human experts. And finally, accelerating international growth with Mailchimp and QuickBooks. We\u2019ve translated the Mailchimp offering into five different languages for markets where we see a large TAM. Looking ahead, we are bringing QuickBooks and Mailchimp together to create a single growth platform, differentiated in the markets where we have product market fit, including in Canada, U.K., and Australia. In other geographies, we are leading with Mailchimp's strong international footprint to help small businesses get customers as we continue to localize the offering. Wrapping up, with the progress and momentum we are delivering, and the accelerated investment areas I've shared, we are in a great position to win as an end-to-end platform with experiences that fuel the success of customers. Intuit is the AI-driven expert platform that is powering prosperity for consumers, small and mid-market businesses. With that -- now let me hand it over to Sandeep. Sandeep Aujla : Thanks, Sasan. We delivered very strong results in fiscal 2024 across the company, including total revenue growth of 13%, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 40 and 100 basis points, respectively, and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of 24% and 18%, respectively. Our fourth quarter results include : Revenue of $3.2 billion, up 17%. GAAP operating loss of $151 million, versus GAAP operating income of $17 million last year, reflecting a restructuring charge of $223 million recognized in the quarter related to the organizational changes we announced in July. Non-GAAP operating income of $730 million, versus $627 million last year, up 16%. GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.07, versus diluted earnings per share of $0.32 a year ago, also reflecting the restructuring charge. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.99, versus $1.65 last year, up 21%. Turning to the business segments : In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, the revenue grew 20% during the quarter, and 19% for the full-year. This momentum demonstrates the power of our small and mid-market business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings as customers look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. Online ecosystem revenue grew 18% during the quarter and 20% for the full-year, driven by our progress serving customers with more complex needs and adoption of our ecosystem of services. As a result, online ecosystem ARPC grew 11% in fiscal 2024. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is three-fold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem, and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 17% in Q4 and 19% in fiscal 2024. Growth for the quarter and year was driven by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix-shift. We delivered growth in our declared strategic areas this year, with our emphasis on serving customers with more complex needs. This focus drove U.S. QBO customers excluding self-employed up 11%, QBO Advanced customers up 28%, while QBO self-employed customers declined 14%, resulting in total online paying customers up 6%. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 19% in Q4, driven by payments, payroll, capital, and Mailchimp. For the full fiscal year 2024, Online services revenue grew 21%, driven by payroll, payments, Mailchimp and capital. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects higher effective prices, ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow, and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Total online payment volume growth in Q4 was 19%, relatively consistent with the range we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions, higher effective prices, and a mix-shift towards higher end offerings. Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. Revenue growth continues to be impacted by the lapping of a larger benefit from price and line-up changes that we made last year in Q2 and Q3. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and line-up. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 11% in Q4 and 13% in fiscal 2024. Turning to desktop. We successfully concluded the three-year transition to a subscription model, which contributed to 25% desktop ecosystem revenue growth in Q4 and 16% revenue growth in fiscal 2024. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the low-30s in Q4, and in the high-teens for fiscal year 2024. Our Q4 desktop ecosystem revenue growth also reflects the offering changes we made in early fiscal 2024 to complete the transition to a recurring subscription model. These changes resulted in approximately $60 million of desktop revenue recognized in Q4 and approximately $50 million recognized in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, all of which would have otherwise been recognized in Q1 of fiscal 2025. We also expect approximately $50 million of desktop revenue that would have otherwise been recognized in Q1 fiscal 2025 to shift to later quarters in fiscal 2025. In total, these changes lower Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue by approximately $160 million and are largely related to more frequent product updates, beginning in Q4 of fiscal 2024, to align the customer delivery experience to our subscription model. Accordingly, we expect Q1 desktop ecosystem revenue to decline approximately 20% for Q1, but for desktop ecosystem revenue to return to growth in Q2. Overall, we expect desktop ecosystem revenue to grow in the low-single-digits in fiscal 2025. Turning to Credit Karme. Credit Karma revenue growth improved each quarter during fiscal 2024, from a 5%, decline in Q1 to 14% growth in Q4. On a product basis in Q4, auto insurance accounted for 6 points of growth, personal loans accounted for 5 points, credit cards accounted for 2 points, and Credit Karma Money accounted for 1 point. Full-year revenue was $1.7 billion, up 5%. We are pleased with the momentum driven by our relentless focus on what matters most to our members and partners. We made strong progress this year redesigning the Credit Karma app to enable members to see much more of their financial life and find the products right for them. We also introduced Intuit Assist to deliver personalized financial insights using data and AI, increased monetization in the underpenetrated Prime segment, and made it easier than ever for consumers to benefit from the Credit Karma and TurboTax product integration. I\u2019m proud of the progress the team made innovating on behalf of our members and partners. Consumer and ProTax Groups. Consumer Group revenue of $4.4 billion grew 7% in fiscal 2024 as we continue to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses. TurboTax Live revenue grew 17%, and customers grew 11%. Full-service customers doubled, while those new to TurboTax tripled. We are pleased with the momentum we saw with TurboTax Live again this season. Turning to the ProTax Group, revenue was $599 million in fiscal 2024, up 7%. In summary, I\u2019m pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year and our opportunities ahead. Shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions, they remain our long-term commitment, and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.1 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $255 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $2.0 billion during fiscal 2024. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share, payable on October 18, 2024. This represents a 16% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, our fiscal 2025 guidance includes : Total company revenue of $18.16 billion to $18.347 billion, growth of 12% to 13%. Our guidance includes revenue growth of 16% to 17% for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, including online ecosystem revenue growth of approximately 20% and desktop ecosystem revenue growth in the low-single-digits. Our guidance also includes revenue growth of 7% to 8% for the Consumer Group, and 5% to 8% for Credit Karma. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $12.34 to $12.54, growth of 18% to 20%; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $19.16 to $19.36, growth of 13% to 14%. We expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% in fiscal 2025. GAAP guidance reflects an expected $24 million restructuring charge related to the reorganization we announced in July. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 includes : Total company revenue growth of 5% to 6%, including: Small Business and Self-Employed group revenue growth of 6% to 7%, reflecting the revenue shift in Q1 resulting from the desktop offering changes that I noted earlier. We expect desktop ecosystem revenue to decline approximately 20% in Q1, and the online ecosystem, which is our growth catalyst, to accelerate to approximately 19% growth in Q1. For Credit Karma, we expect revenue to grow in Q1. And for Consumer Group and ProTax revenue to decline in Q1, as we are lapping the period a year ago that included the extended California tax filing deadline. GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 to $0.66, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.33 to $2.38. GAAP guidance reflects an expected $19 million restructuring charge that we expect to incur in Q1 related to the reorganization we announced in July. You can find our full fiscal 2025 and Q1 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. I will now shift to our long-term growth expectations for each of our business segments. First, small business. With the momentum we see in online ecosystem growth, we are reiterating our long-term revenue growth expectations for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group of 15% to 20%. As part of this, we continue to expect online paying ARPC growth of 10% to 20%, and we now expect online paying customer growth of 5% to 10%. This reflects our shift in emphasis towards ARPC as we scale mid-market, drive growth in services, and reshape how we go-to-market as one business platform to significantly increase adoption of all our offerings. While there are relatively fewer mid-market customers, the ARPC of mid-market QuickBooks Online customers is nearly 3 times higher than other QuickBooks Online customers. Turning to Credit Karma, we are excited about the opportunity ahead as we execute our strategy to more deeply penetrate our core verticals, scale in growth verticals and execute our consumer ecosystem strategy. With the learnings from operating in the current business cycle, we are updating our long-term revenue growth expectations to 10% to 15%, reflecting the current size and scale of the business, and as we focus on creating seamless, end-to-end experiences with TurboTax that benefit consumers from year-round. Finally, the Consumer Group. Based on the momentum we saw this season, and the significant runway we have ahead to penetrate our TAM, we expect assisted penetration to be the key driver of future growth. TurboTax Live revenue accounted for approximately 30% of Consumer Group revenue in fiscal 2024, and we expect it to become the majority of Consumer Group revenue in the coming years. With that context, while we are scaling assisted, we are adjusting the Consumer Group long-term revenue growth rate to 6% to 10% in this interim period, with TurboTax Live revenue expected to grow 15% to 20%. One final note before I wrap up. Starting in Q1, we will be changing the name of our Small Business and Self-Employed Group to Global Business Solutions Group. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, and our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the end-to-end platform that customers use to grow and run their business. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Thanks Sandeep. We are confident in our long term growth strategy, including double-digit revenue growth and operating income growing faster than revenue. We have the strategy to win given the green shoots we're observing, and with less than 5% penetration of our $300 billion in TAM, with a massive runway ahead. We look forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day next month, where we\u2019ll unpack all of this and more. Let\u2019s now open it up to your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Goodarzi. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this afternoon to Siti Panigrahi at Mizuho. Siti Panigrahi : Great. Thank you. If one question, then Sasan, I will focus on small business segment, 19% growth is pretty good in this environment, where we are hearing about SMB weakness. But I want to focus on your growth in \u201825 -- fiscal '25 and beyond. Now it looks like your focus is now driving growth through targeting mid-market. You talked about that and renamed that. So help us understand how big is that opportunity to expand into mid-market? And why is this the right time for Intuit to increase focus on mid-market? And is it mostly targeting this, your QuickBooks customer base? Or are you planning to gain share from other vendors? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Siti, thank you for your question. First of all, I want to start with our focus will continue to be Small Businesses that are formed and because we want to fundamentally continue to grow with them. With that as context, we've just simply doubled down on our focus on mid-market. And as you know, it's not new. This has been five years in the making. It's one of the five Bets that we declared more than five years ago. But I would just say, five years later, Siti, we are just building an incredible amount of momentum. With that as context, let me just now answer your question. One, the way to think about it is we now have a business suite. And our business suite provides all the capabilities to -- for our business to be able to grow their customers, manage their customers, be able to manage their cash flow, get their accounting done, all in 1 place. And with our really AI-powered innovation and AI-powered experts, we really have tilted the professional grade help and services to all of our businesses. And we are now at a place where we are really accelerating on two fronts. One, we are going to go to market as one platform versus pieces and parts to really accelerate services penetration because of the one thing we continue to hear from businesses is that they want to do everything in one place and now we have the business suite for them to do everything in one place. Secondarily is our acceleration in mid-market. We're actually excited to announce at Investor Day a platform that will take us even further up market, and that really positions us to not only grow with our customers but to really acquire new customers. I would just remind us that the majority of mid-market customers are nonconsumption. And they pay a lot of money to use multiple different apps, discrete apps that don't talk to each other. Excel spreadsheets, Google Sheets, shoe boxes, and paying for multiple different bookkeepers, marketing agents and ultimately, accountants. And now we have packaged all of that as one enterprise suite to be able to pursue and accelerate pursuing mid-market customers. And our ultimate goal is to go far beyond 10 to 100 employees. And so I think this is five years in the making. And to round out the answer to your question, this is both focusing on the smaller customers, but we're really doubling down on the larger customers and really being able to penetrate services. And that's really what gives us confidence in the 20% online ecosystem revenue growth at a far bigger scale that you heard from Sandeep, along with our acceleration in Q1. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. I look forward to hearing more at the investors' day. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you for your question. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Alex Zukin at Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about Consumer, the guide for the coming year, the updated mid-term guide. If you can just walk through a little bit of the puts and takes where -- why was that the right place to start the annual guide, what could drive upside surprise as the tax season progresses? And maybe, Sasan, just your view on kind of the macroeconomic backdrop that, that Consumer guide is set against? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, absolutely, Alex. Thank you for your question. Let me start with the last part of your question, which is around the macro environment. We have not assumed anything other than the current environment. We're not assuming any tailwinds coming from the macro environment. So that's really been one of the elements that's informed our guidance. It's really about our current trends that we're seeing our current momentum that we're seeing and really all focused on our own execution. So that's really the first part of your question. I would say the second part is just as a refresher, the total tax market is about $35 billion in TAM, $5 billion of that is do-it-yourself and about $30 billion is both -- is all assisted, but consumer and on the business side. We've got great momentum. As you know, TurboTax Live grew 17% this past year, but the number of full-service customers that we got double, new to the franchise tripled. And so we have a lot of momentum as we look ahead, and that's why we have a lot of confidence in really providing an expectation that we expect TurboTax Live to grow between 15% to 20%. And that really leads to -- we wanted to just adjust our long-term expectations to be really prudent because until TurboTax Live, which today is 30% of our franchise, growing high-double-digits, until that becomes a larger part of our franchise, we wanted to be prudent with our long-term expectation. I will just end with saying that DIY is actually very important, and I would parse it into two. One, we're actually growing quite rapidly, and I would say, high-single-digits with complex customers with higher income, and we're actually accelerating taking share. And based on our learnings this year and based on our trade-offs that we made this year and our focus this year, we're going to be quite assertive in continuing to pursue lower income customers this year because we have a lot of green shoots from this past year with our experiments of how to deliver benefits and monetize beyond tax with our Credit Karma platform. And so we're going to be leaning into that. And I'll just end with the final aspect of the question that you asked, really are upside to our guide, which is, I think, a question you asked around TurboTax comes from really two dimensions. One, accelerating in assisted tax beyond the 15% to 20%; and two, actually accelerating where we've seen a lot of green shoots, which is the more complex, higher income customers that are DIY. We have positioned ourselves for the innovation and the lineup that's required to win on both fronts in the coming years. So that's where our confidence comes from. Alex Zukin : Okay. Thank you, guys. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you, Alex. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Sasan, I wanted to ask about the restructuring, which I know you take very seriously. We appreciate it wasn't motivated by cost savings, but rather to better position the company ahead. How are you thinking about reinvesting any savings as it takes time to staff back up to prior levels? Are there specific initiatives that dollars get allocated to? Any additional color would be great. Thanks. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, sure, Brad. First of all, I just want to start with acknowledging we are a culture about talent and people and compassion and care. And this is a very, very tough decision. And we took great care of our teams internally, both those that are staying and getting them excited about why we're doing this and what's in the future and they remain extremely energized. But secondarily, taking great care of those that were impacted. And I just wanted to start there because these things are hard for us. We take it very seriously. We also believe that it's critically important to position the company for the future. And as we communicated, which is really the plan that we're executing against and a lot of what my upfront comments were, we are really taking all of the dollars and reinvesting it in five areas, which I articulated earlier in my prepared remarks. And really, our intent is to put all of those dollars back in the five areas that we've seen a lot of green shoots in this past several years. They accelerated towards really the latter part of last fiscal year, which is hence the decision to really double down in those five areas. So our intent is to allocate all of those dollars to those five areas. And of course, it's spread across marketing, customer success and additional headcount, engineering headcount in the areas that I mentioned. And we expect -- by the way, there's no expectation of any of these paying off in the coming year. None of our guidance that we provided resides on the added headcount back in. This is really positioning us for the next two, three years plus. That's an important note for all of you know because there's really no risk to our execution plan as we think about the coming year, but really this is about positioning us in the future. I'll just end with the following : we have a lot of confidence with the margin expansion that Sandeep articulated, and not only from the platform leverage that we're getting, but from all of our AI investments internally to drive a lot of efficiency and productivity. Sandeep Aujla : Brad, the only thing I would add is we didn't have a standing start as we made that announcement. We were already contemplating as you probably saw from our open job listings, those had increased over the last quarter. We started building out our mid-market go-to-market function as well as scaling our marketing activities, particularly as we go after the assisted tax category, which has a different marketing timing than the DIY category. Brad Zelnick : Thanks, Sandeep. Look forward to seeing you guys at Investor Day. Sandeep Aujla : Thank you. We do this. We look forward to it as well. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Brent Thill at Jefferies. Brent Thill : Thanks. Sasan, when you think about the Mailchimp reacceleration, what do you need to put in place to enable that to get to the level you'd like to see? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. There are really three areas that we've been executing that are worth calling out that we're excited about. One is the integration with the QuickBooks platform. As I mentioned earlier, one of the biggest areas why we're able to accelerate our customer growth with U.S. QBO, customer growth of 11%, the QBO advanced to 28% is really creating a suite where our platform is all in one place. So that's one area that we are aggressively focused on data and tech integration. And of course, workflow integration, and we're making great progress on that front. That's number one. Number two is mid-market. That is an area where it was critical when we declared the acquisition of Mailchimp, we're building momentum. Both, by the way, what we're doing to integrate the offering, but also our go-to-market capabilities. As we announced, I think, last quarter, Greg Johnson is now back with Intuit. He runs all of our go-to-market for all of small business, and we've brought together our sales and marketing and customer success across Mailchimp and QuickBooks to be able to be better positioned for mid-market. And then last is international. Those are the three areas that we're very focused on. And when we look at our KPIs, we're making solid progress against those three areas, and that's one of the reasons why it leaves us excited about the coming year and the future. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the questions and congratulations on a really solid quarter. I wanted to ask about the acceleration in QBO into Q1. We've seen two quarters of deceleration in both QuickBooks online subscriptions and the online services. The confidence in the acceleration, is that based upon like price increases? Or is there something you're seeing in units or other parts of the business that are giving you guys confidence in guiding towards an acceleration for Q1? And then as a follow-up, talked a lot about where the reinvestment of the dollars or the heads from the headcount reduction came from. Can you give us a little bit of visibility of where those heads came out of? Like what are the parts of the business that you guys are paring back investment in? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Great. Thank you for your question, Keith. I'll start with your first question. Really, our acceleration comes from three areas. One, acceleration in services. And this is services across payments, across payroll, across our live platform and what we expect in Mailchimp. So that's one key area. The second key area is mid-market, where as we shared earlier, we've seen very good traction with QBO events, and we really continue to build out our go-to-market efforts on our platform capabilities. And that's informing by the way, what we're seeing in Q1, but also the fact that we shared earlier that we expect our online ecosystem revenue to be 20%, which is what it was this past year. And the third is price. Those three have played a big role in our acceleration. And the thing I would just call out on price, everything that we really learn and hear from our customers is because we have a business suite in one place, they're actually saving time they need less labor. They're able to drive customer growth based on our capabilities and better manage their cash flow because we're digitizing their cash flow. And that plays a very big role in terms of just the pricing power that we have, especially in our higher-end SKUs. But those are the three things that give us confidence into Q1 and beyond. And as you know, the majority of this business is subscription-based. So it's very predictable. In terms of the -- your second question around, well, where did the heads coming from in terms of the restructuring, there was really several key areas. I would say the largest area as we looked across the company and we looked at talent that we felt there was an opportunity for better performance. This was about 8% of our talent. These are, by the way, very talented folks that will lend great opportunities elsewhere. But it was across the company. It was not from any particular area, which, by the way, why there's really no execution risk from the actions that we took because this wasn't from one area. This was from across the company and talent that was we believe we have an opportunity to upgrade talent. So that was really one area. The second is, we really consolidated some of our technology talent across multiple sites, closing down Boise and Edmonton and consolidating technology talent in our key areas, Tel Aviv, Bangalore, Atlanta and Toronto. But those, I would say, were the main drivers of where the restructuring came from. And then, of course, we're allocating all of it to the 5 areas that I mentioned earlier. Sandeep Aujla : The only thing I would add, Keith, to Sasan's first part of that question. If you recall in my prepared remarks, I talked about QBO U.S. growing 11%, advance growing 28%. These larger customers tend to adopt and use services at a higher rate than the self-employed that decline, so that's an important attribute to keep in mind. And secondly, on pricing, we look at pricing very carefully, our price volume mix and well over half of our growth comes from volume and mix. And at the company level, the contributions for price are relatively consistent year-over-year while they are slightly higher in the Small Business group. So that's the second component to keep into mind as we look at the trajectory heading into Q1. Keith Weiss : Super helpful. Thank you guys. Sandeep Aujla : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to Kash Rangan at Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much, team here. A nice finish to the fiscal year and quite positive on the guidance too. One, I couldn't help but notice that your Small Business, the Self-Employed Group is now running at the rate of $10 billion, I think, as of this most recent quarter, 10-ish. Very few companies in software -- in the enterprise software market hit the $10 billion. And congrats, you are there, you've done it with finance accounting for the most part you got payments and payroll. So this puts you on track with ServiceNow, I believe also tendering at a run rate business growing a little bit faster and you're moving upmarket, your SKU mix is decidedly more advanced and less so of lower-value units. So this has been, at least from my perspective, more successful, your tendering dollars and revenue, one of the largest enterprise software companies in the world. So haven't come this far, where else could you go with this business? And I'm glad I'm not asking your tax question. Thank you so much Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you for the question, Kash. And also, by the way, the setup, as you saw in our guide we're guiding our Global Business Solutions Group to be north of $11 billion, growing 16% to 17% in the coming year, and particularly with online growing at 20%. And I would just tell you all of that has been done without really much, I would say, massive contribution from mid-market. So the best is yet to come because we are going to continue and if you look at where we are today versus three years ago, we truly have a business suite where we have all of the key capabilities for a business to be able to grow and run their business. And we've been investing in the last five years to be positioned to go after mid-market. And our ultimate goal is to have all of the big brand names, be on our mid-market platform, and we will announce something I think you'll find exciting at our Investor Day that really positions us to be able to serve these larger customers. And that's really when you look at the future -- when we look at the future, where we get really excited is that we're actually at where we are with an incredible franchise without really having a significant contribution from mid-market. And that's what excites us about the future because we want to continue to serve smaller businesses, but we now have a real opportunity to win in mid-market. And I would remind us of the following. It's probably the most important point that I'll make. Mid-market, when it comes to financial management platforms is actually not a crowded space. And so we have an incredible right to win. And this is really precisely what we hear from accountants and from mid-market businesses. We're really excited about the next chapter of taking our business group from we're $10 billion today to much larger as we look into the next three to five years. Kash Rangan : Thank you, Sir. $10 onto $20. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, indeed. See you at Investor Day. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Yes, thanks. I\u2019ll echo my congrats on the quarter and upbeat guidance in the next year. I guess, Sasan, my question comes around sort of the Global Business Solutions Group. How are you thinking about Intuit Assist impact on that in the coming year. Where is that sort of in the integration process? I'd just be curious about how you see that empowering your customers, maybe growing, helping in areas like mid-market or attach rates on some of your other products in that area. So why don't you just answer that, discuss Intuit Assist on the small business side. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, Kirk, thank you for the question. First of all, let me just start with we haven't accounted for or assumed anything in our guidance or around Intuit Assist for the coming year. So I just wanted to start there. Now let me get to your question. We actually have an incredible amount of momentum with Intuit Assist, you're going to see it at Investor Day. But let me start with the foundation of what I shared in the prepared remarks, which was we have about 1 million businesses that are engaging with Intuit Assist. And it is going to play a significant role in the future because that is actually the foundation of what we bet the company on six years ago, which was really around data and AI. But really the bet was about delivering experiences where we do the work for our customers. And so a number of areas that our customers are using today as part of the million that I mentioned is along the lines of marketing campaigns with proposed revenue that our customers could garner that we could then execute on the behalf of our customers. Things like taking, by the way, pictures of an estimate that you may have written on the go then you can take a picture of them, we will create a digitized estimate, invoice your payment schedule that you want, all within the platform. Send it to your customer, remind you in the business feed of, in essence, invoices that are overdue, capital that we can give you access to. And that's what I just mentioned are elements of what some of our customers are using today. And so we're really right now focused on sort of money in, money out because those are the most critical areas for our customers. And if I just take a step forward, ultimately, our entire goal because of our advantage, which is data and AI. Our goal is that we do all of the work for our customers. These examples I just illustrated is all on that path. Now what it means for us as a company beyond the -- of course, the benefit of helping drive revenue growth and profitability growth for businesses. What it means for us is, we believe it will have an impact in a couple of areas. One, new customer growth; particularly the smaller customers; but then two, adoption of our services because the examples I just mentioned, take a picture of a scribble note, upload a PDF file will create estimates invoicing progress payments that all turns into revenue for us. And that, by the way, doesn't even touch on the fact that embedded in our platform going forward is going to be AI-powered live expertise, which is a monetizable event ultimately with the goal of we do everything for you and with you. And so it will be an enormous sort of part of our experience and growth in the future. And we're making really good progress. All of which, by the way, will also show all of you at Investor Day. And I'll end with where I started. None of this is contemplated in our guidance, but it's a big part of our future, and we're excited about it. Kirk Materne : Super. Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Kartik Mehta at Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Good evening, Sansa and Sandeep. Just a question on tax. Sasan, it seems as though you're executing on the live products, you're starting to execute on the full service. I'm just wondering what was the thought of maybe lowering guidance now, considering the momentum you're building in the business? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you for the question. First of all, I would start with -- it's actually one platform, and that's the power of our scale. Customers, ultimately, can do it themselves, they can do it with assistance or we'll do it for customers. And it's all on TurboTax platform and our experts, our virtual experts all sit on the same platform, except they're on the other side of the platform, which is leveraging the customers' data and AI capabilities to do their taxes for them or with them. So I just wanted to start with that foundational point that it's not a lot of different products. It's actually one platform, which is what gives us the scale that we're looking for. When we make decisions around long-term expectations, we don't make them lightly. In fact, I think it was 5.5 years ago, right when I became CEO, we had updated the long-term expectations of tax. And so we take these decisions very seriously. And really what -- and so it's something we've been thinking about for some time. And really, it comes down to a very a simple math equation. When you look at the TAM, which is $35 billion, $5 billion do it yourself and $30 billion assisted both consumer and business, that's where the largest growth opportunity is. That's where we're really growing high-double-digits, 17% with customers growing 11%. And it's 30% of the franchise today, and we are also being very aggressive with DIY, both complex higher-income customers. But based on some green shoots that we saw this year, we're also going to be very assertive with lower income folks that are in the do-it-yourself category. And in that context, we just felt like the time was right to not only guide prudently for the coming year. But also adjust the long-term expectations. And I want to reiterate what you heard from Sandeep it's an interim adjust. And once we get to sustained, growth double-digit, we'll then rethink the long-term guidance. But until then, that's what informed the decision that we made. Kartik Mehta : And just one follow-up, Sasan, as you look at the health of the Small Business, any change as you look throughout the quarter? Any changes that may be give you concern or hope what's happening to your customers? Sasan Goodarzi : The headline I would give you, Kartik, is stable. Across our small businesses, we generally, differs by the way, by sector, by state, by country. But at an Uber level, we see revenue and profitability up in this fiscal year for businesses that we serve. We see cash reserves still down 6% to 7% compared to last year, but it's way up compared to pre-pandemic levels. We also see hours worked higher. So headline is stable. And by the way, we see the same thing on the consumer side, which is stable. Kartik Mehta : Okay, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, very welcome. Operator : We'll go next now to Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks for taking my question. It was great to hear about QBO Live, the number of clients more than tripling. Can you maybe spend a moment talking about what's resonating there? And as you sort of move more into the middle market, what's the opportunity for QBO Live to accelerate that more upmarket push? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you for the question. Let me start with your question of what's resonated with the smaller businesses. For us, we've actually had product market fit, meaning that our experts on our platform can really help our businesses with bookkeeping, accounting, providing advice. Really, the biggest challenge that we've been working through in the last year is how to think about the benefit? How to think about the offering? How do we actually go to market because the great news is every business at some point in their life throughout a year, they're engaging a bookkeeper and an accountant. So we're not trying to create opportunity. The opportunity is there. It's just it's manual, it's disaggregated. It's high price. And so really, the biggest thing has been our focus on how do you really help the customer understand that this is now a part of our platform and that we can help them with all the key problems that they have. And I would say that, that's an area where we really uncovered how to do that, and we're accelerating. And I don't want to make you feel like we've reached the destination. I think we still have a lot of work to do in this area. But we\u2019ve really, I would say, cracked a nut that we're excited about, particularly around our decision to embed AI-powered experts into our offering as we look ahead. And lastly, this is a far bigger opportunity with larger customers because they expected. They expect a CFO for a hire and HR for hire. They expect an assistant to be able to help them with their books, with their accounting, with their employee inventory decisions. And so part of what you'll hear us talk about at Investor Day is as we're accelerating our focus with mid-market, with a business suite that has all the key capabilities that a business needs a big element of it is the expertise that it comes with. I think the differentiator for us is these are AI-powered experts that sit on the platform, can really provide a range of services for customers. But we believe it's a bigger opportunity as we move upmarket. And last thing, by the way, I'll end with, these are small sample sizes still. But the -- those that have live experts, the attach and use of services like payments and payroll actually higher, which really is a great benefit for customers and for us. Daniel Jester : Great, thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Very welcome. Operator : We'll go next now to Arvind Ramnani at Piper Sandler. Arvind Ramnani : Hi, this is Arvind. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of questions. In some of the prior calls, you have provided some additional color on some of the kind of benefits you're seeing with AI. And given [Technical Difficulty] Sasan Goodarzi : In and out. We can now, please go ahead and continue. Arvind Ramnani : Yes. I'm just trying to get some color on your -- some of the impact of AI that you've seen both from a revenue add but also from a cost perspective across your business, is there any additional information you're able to kind of provide in terms of quantification of those benefits you're starting to see? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. Thank you for your question. I think a couple of things I would say. First of all, we're seeing the impact of our usage and innovation across all of our platforms. Across Credit Karma, it's really driving a lot of the automation and do it for our customers within TurboTax, even with TurboTax full service, we're doing a lot of the work for experts so that they can serve more customers and, of course, across our business platform that I articulated the examples earlier. So I want to first be clear, this is broad-based across our entire platform. And we are really focused on how AI reimagines our internal work within Intuit as well. I would say the -- really, the revenue is immaterial this year, and we didn't account for anything in the coming year, but we believe it will be a large driver of growth in the future years. And the growth will be really usage of services, better conversion, better retention, and these are the green shoots that we're seeing with, for instance, our million businesses that are using it today. And in terms of our cost structure, remember, data and AI have been core to our investment thesis and our Bets over the last five, six years. And what we do is not capital intensive. At the same time, we're very intentional about the investments that we've had to make and any investments we need to make to win in this world of AI has been contemplated in the guidance that you heard from Sandeep. I don't know, Sandeep, if you add anything? Sandeep Aujla : No, I think that covers. 1 thing to keep in mind as we compare us to possibly other companies in your portfolio, one point, AI sort of really been in our run rate. So I wouldn't expect any meaningful change in our cost structure. Secondly, we use AWS for a lot of the processing. So it's not like we're building up our own data centers. So that's also very asset light for us. And the other factor, as Sasan alluded to, we are quite frankly also seeing improvements in our own productivity. We are seeing improvements in our developer productivity. We're seeing improvements in our overall G&A productivity. So just factors to keep in mind that AI should not be not getting in the way of our commitment to continue to find operating leverage and continue to scale our margin over time. Arvind Ramnani : Perfect. And just one quick follow-up. Just on TurboTax Live, as you're thinking of kind of directing questions or your customers to having kind of AI sort of answer it versus QuickBooks Live or sort of the kind of accountant or CPA. Obviously, the AI is going to be like a lower ARPU versus like directing someone who is basically like more like service-oriented. How do you balance that? Because does come at like a higher ARPU, but lower margin. And of course, AI is lower revenue, lower ARPU but higher margins. How do you balance it out? Sasan Goodarzi : Yes. I think the premise of what you're articulating is not what we're seeing. We actually believe that based on all of our investments with data and AI, it's actually higher ARPU because it drives better attach of our services. It actually drives more attach of our human-powered expertise. And by the way, when our human-powered experts or AI-powered human experts get involved, they're actually quite effective and productive because they're sitting on our data and AI platform. So we're actually seeing two things. One, higher ARPU over time because of what I articulated, but also more effective and efficiency on our platform because we are as aggressive as we are in applying AI externally we are as aggressive internally based on what you just heard Sandeep talk about. So it's actually the reverse of the premise that you talked about in terms of what we see. I don't know, Sandeep, if you would add anything. Sandeep Aujla : Yes. The thing to keep in mind is AI is -- the name of the game is confidence and eliminating fear, uncertainty and doubt. And by using AI, by using our AI powered experts, we're actually doing that at scale. And the important thing to keep in mind is it actually helping us open up the aperture of the customers we can serve and really go after penetrating a TAM. That's driving a lot of the success that you've seen in the assisted category. Some of those are fully outsourced to us, some of those that do it with me. So just something to keep in mind as you look at the strategic opportunities that this opens up for us as well. Arvind Ramnani : That's been really helpful, Thank you very much. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Brad Sills with Bank of America. Brad Sills : Okay, wonderful. I wanted to ask a question around the platform for AI, the GenOS and the studio that you've outlined in the past, I know it's a little further out to start thinking about separate SKUs, and it sounds like this is more of a conversion and a retention play in the near term. But what were some of the learnings that you had over the course of the year in building out that platform for AI, harnessing the data and some of the platform components that you've outlined at the Analyst Day last year that are underpinning that. Sasan Goodarzi : Sure. First of all, let me start with your question around the SKUs. This is a progression, and this is a really important element to call out. What you heard us talk about is that we believe, and we're seeing this in our proof points. And the green shoots that we're seeing is that, one, this will drive new customer growth because we will just make it far easier and simpler for a new customer to use our digital platform that comes with AI-powered experts. Two, we believe that it's an opportunity for the adoption of our services, which also includes Live. Services like payments, payroll, Mailchimp and our live platform, which is our AI-powered human experts. And those are significant customer and growth drivers for us. The progression is as we are focused on the innovation that we articulated earlier, things such as literally a customer being able to take a picture of a scribble note, upload a PDF document for us to be able to put together an estimate all the way to getting them paid following up with their customers, putting marketing campaigns together for them. The progression is we'll get to a place where we'll actually test stand-alone SKUs where the AI agent is doing everything for the customer. And that could be a stand-alone SKU that we could test sometime in the future, but you have to progress your way to that. And that's really what the element of progression talks to. The last thing, which I think was the other element of your question, what we're doing is really hard, which we love because it's hard to replicate. And what's hard about it is, first, you have to have the data. And we have a lot of data. It's our customers' data. But when you look at for every business, we have 500,000 data points. That means we are uniquely positioned to be able to help them with managing their cash flow because it's about their cash flow. It's not about something generic because we see all of their money coming in, money going out, the creditworthiness of their vendors, the employees that they have. And so the investments that we've made in the data has been more than ever crucial because then it allows us to leverage our GenOS platform, which is our GenAI capabilities and train the Intuit LLM on the customer's data to be able to then deliver the experiences that I was just articulating and our LLMS have agency and authority to be able to use other LLMs that could enhance the experience. So the biggest thing that we've learned to sort of punchline answer your question is the combination of the data investments, the investments we've made in knowledge engineering, machine learning and our LLM that really delivers accuracy performance cost effectively is extremely hard to copy because we live in a world of financial management, and that's really our biggest advantage going forward and really our biggest growth opportunity as we look ahead. Brad Sills : That's exciting. Thanks, Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions this afternoon. At this time, Mr. Goodarzi, I'd like to turn things back to you for any closing comments, sir. Sasan Goodarzi : Well, listen, everybody, thank you for your time. Thank you for all of your questions, and we hope to see all of you at Investor Day. Be safe. We'll see you soon. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude Intuit's Fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 conference call. Again, thanks so much for joining us, everyone. We wish you all a great evening. Good-bye.",

My name is David, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins, thank you. Kim Watkins : Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's first quarter fiscal 2025 conference call. I am here with Intuit CEO, Sasan Goodarzi, and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2024, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the investor relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I will turn the call over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Great. Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. It was wonderful to see many of you at investor day. We hope you were inspired by our momentum and innovation that demonstrates the power of our AI-driven expert platform strategy, which is delivering tangible benefits for our customers and fueling Intuit's growth. With that as context, let's talk about the first quarter. We have a strong start to the year, growing revenue 10% driven by our Global Business Solutions Group online ecosystem revenue growth of 20% and Credit Karma revenue growth of 29%. We are confident in delivering double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion this year, and we are reiterating our full-year guidance. The future is here, and it's AI-driven. It will fundamentally transform every part of our work and personal lives. We have transformed the company from a tax and accounting platform to an AI-driven expert platform. We are leading this transformation by creating done-for-you experiences where the customer is always in control. Enabled by AI with access to AI-powered human experts, our platform fuels the financial success of consumers and businesses. We have a significant competitive advantage with our scale of data, data services, AI capabilities, ecosystem of applications, and our large network of AI-powered virtual experts. We are disrupting the categories we operate in to drive better money outcomes for consumers and businesses. The progress we have delivered and the proof points we are observing continue to bolster our confidence in our strategy. I will now share how our big bets are solving customer problems and powering our success as a platform. Starting with our consumer platform, Big Bet three is focused on helping customers make smart money decisions, take steps to improve their financial health year-round, achieve their best tax outcome, and accelerate the receipt of their refund. We are focusing on winning as an AI-driven expert platform by leading with ease of use, speed to completion, and best price for our customers. Our strategy is to first win in the do-it-yourself tax category by improving value for low-income filers, accelerating growth with more complex filers, and offering fast refund access. Second, we are disrupting the assisted tax category. We are showing how the new way of taxes done for you is superior in experience, speed, and price. We have expanded marketing to drive awareness ahead of tax season and are working on methods to surface our experts in local search and match customers with the best expert for them. Third, we are driving year-round engagement with our consumer platform, accelerating money benefits, including refund access, and growing Credit Karma across our verticals such as Prime and insurance, all of which accelerates monetization. Moving on to our business platform, our vision is to help customers run and grow their businesses end-to-end. We made significant progress during the quarter across two of our big bets. Our first bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit, delivering done-for-you experiences with Intuit Assist, our Gen AI-powered financial assistant. After successfully piloting Intuit Assist with over two million customers, it is now generally available to all US QuickBooks online customers. To help businesses manage cash flow, Intuit Assist uses AI agents to automatically turn emails, electronic documents, and handwritten notes into estimates, invoices, and bills. It spots potential cash flow shortages in real-time and suggests solutions like applying for a line of credit. It also generates invoice reminders to help customers get paid 45% faster, an average of five days sooner, and automates accounting by matching transactions to bills and invoices for review. This is the power of our AI-driven expert platform, delivering tangible benefits to our customers, which we expect to drive increased adoption of our platform, and we are just getting started. Shifting to Big Bet five, disrupts the mid-market, which represents an $89 billion TAM. We already have 800,000 mid-market customers in our franchise, who can grow into our QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise Suite offerings. In fiscal year 2024, QBO Advanced customers moved 28% online ecosystem revenue grew 36%, and ecosystem ARPC was 5x that of the rest of the QBO base. We introduced Intuit Enterprise Suite or IES to expand further upmarket from where we are today with a configurable suite of integrated financial products for mid-market businesses. With IES, focusing on addressing the needs of complex businesses enabling multi-entity management, leveraging AI agents to boost productivity through powerful automation, and delivering actionable insights. While it's early days, I will share two customer examples that highlight the opportunity ahead and give us confidence in our strategy. We signed an eight-entity RV park operator with approximately $10 million in annual revenue, who was evaluating competitive solutions to streamline its workflow and consolidate reporting across entities. With the seamless upgrade to the IES platform, the company went from outsourcing its multi-entity reporting to a fractional CFO, which took several days, to being able to do this on its own in just five minutes now. With this data immediately accessible and at its fingertips, the company can make the decisions it needs to run and grow its business. Their CTO referred to IES as a game changer for their business and values the relationship-based AI-powered support. We also recently signed an economic development organization with more than $60 million in annual revenue across eighteen corporate entities. As part of its IES contract, this customer also adopted bill pay, payments, and payroll. For customers like this, having all of these services in a single platform solves many challenges by seamlessly integrating data that previously came from multiple app endpoint solutions, helping them streamline operations and save time. Last month, we hosted our first-ever Intuit Connect conference with more than two thousand attendees, including mid-market businesses and the large accounting firms that serve them. We showcased our vision for an end-to-end business platform that fuels revenue and profitability growth for our business customers and the success of accountants. We spotlighted IES, and the initial reaction we received at the event was overwhelmingly positive. Customers that have already been using the offering are strong advocates, sharing that IES is helping them see how their business is performing, saving them time, and helping them make the decisions they need to improve growth and cash flow. In addition, current customers are finding it easier and less costly to upgrade to IES than switch to an entirely new platform. We are excited more than ever to serve this $89 billion mid-market TAM to fuel the success of large businesses and accountants. Wrapping up, we are honored to be ranked number three on Forbes America's best companies list, which came out this month. Forbes evaluated the nation's largest public companies and considered factors such as financial performance, trust, and customer and employee satisfaction. With the progress and momentum we are delivering, we continue to believe we are well-positioned to win as an end-to-end platform with done-for-you experiences that fuel the success of consumers, small, and mid-market businesses. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep. Thanks, Sasan. Sandeep Aujla : We delivered a strong first quarter of fiscal 2025 across the company. Our first quarter results include revenue of $3.3 billion, up 10%. GAAP operating income of $271 million versus $307 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $953 million versus $960 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.70 versus $0.85 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.50 versus $2.47 last year. Our GAAP results reflect a restructuring charge of $9 million recognized in the quarter related to the organizational changes we announced in July and a $42 million net loss on a private company investment. Now turning to the business segments. Starting with the Global Business Solutions Group. Our business platform helps customers run and grow their business end-to-end. Global Business Solutions Group revenue grew 9% during Q1, driven by online ecosystem revenue growth of 20%, a two-point acceleration from the year-over-year growth we saw in Q4. This was partially offset by a 17% decline in desktop ecosystem revenue reflecting the desktop offering changes we made in early fiscal 2024, and highlighted last quarter. The momentum in our online ecosystem is demonstrating the power of a small and mid-market business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings as customers look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment. QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 21% in Q1, driven by customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix shift. We continue to prioritize disrupting the mid-market. Through our focus on both go-to-market motions and product innovations, which we expect to continue to drive ARPC growth. Online services revenue grew 19% in Q1, driven by money offerings, which include payments, capital, and bill pay, payroll, and Mailchimp. Within money, growth in the quarter reflects higher payments revenue, which was driven by customer growth, higher effective prices, and an increase in total payment volume per customer. And QuickBooks capital revenue growth. Total online payment volume growth in Q1 was 17%. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects customer growth, higher effective prices, and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. Within Mailchimp, revenue growth in the quarter was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. We are seeing good progress serving mid-market customers in Mailchimp but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers. We are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve first-time use, and customer retention. While we feel good about the product work we are prioritizing, we are expecting it to take a few quarters to deliver improved outcomes at scale. In addition, beginning next quarter, we are lapping the price changes we made in Q2 of last year. We remain confident in and are executing on our vision of an end-to-end business platform that integrates the power of Mailchimp and QuickBooks group of services enabling our customers to both run and grow their business all in one place. We are executing our international strategy, which includes leading with a connected business platform in our established markets, and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets we continue to execute on a localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 10% in Q1. As we shared at Investor Day, we win as a platform company. Our online ecosystem revenue growth reflects the progress we are making with our strategy of serving both small businesses and mid-market businesses with more complex needs. This represents an addressable market of over $180 billion, roughly half of which is mid-market. In Q1, online ecosystem revenue grew 20%, including approximately 42% growth in online ecosystem revenue for QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise Suite. This reflects our progress serving customers with our mid-market offerings. Online ecosystem revenue for small business and the rest of the base grew a strong 17%. We are excited about our progress in serving mid-market customers while continuing to focus on small businesses. Looking ahead, we continue to expect online ecosystem revenue in total to grow approximately 20% in fiscal 2025. Turning to desktop. During Q1, desktop ecosystem revenue declined 17%, including QuickBooks desktop enterprise revenue, which declined in the low teens. As we described last quarter, Q1 desktop ecosystem revenue reflects changes the company made to its QuickBooks desktop offering in early fiscal 2024 to complete the transition to a recurring subscription model, including more frequent product updates. We continue to expect desktop ecosystem revenue to return to growth in Q2 and overall, we expect desktop ecosystem revenue to grow in the low single digits in fiscal 2025. Turning to a consumer platform, our consumer platform is helping customers make smart money decisions, take steps to improve their financial health year-round, achieve their best tax outcome, and accelerate receipt of the tax refund. Starting with Credit Karma, building on the momentum we saw each quarter in fiscal 2024, Credit Karma revenue growth accelerated to 29% during Q1, reflecting strength in personal loans, auto insurance, and credit cards. On a product basis, personal loans accounted for eleven points of growth, auto insurance accounted for nine points, and credit cards accounted for eight points. Insurance reflects the continuing strength we have seen in partner spend that started in Q3 of fiscal 2024. We are excited about the opportunity ahead for Credit Karma as we execute our strategy to drive engagement, accelerate money benefits across our consumer platform, and grow prime and insurance. Our vision is to create one consumer platform with seamless integration of TurboTax and Credit Karma products that delivers year-round benefits for customers and drives monetization for Intuit. We are excited by our significant progress this year. Moving to consumer and pro tax groups. Consumer group revenue declined 6% as we lapped the period a year ago that included the extended tax filing deadline for most California filers. Our focus this season is on ease, speed, and the best price. Our strategy is to win in DIY tax, disrupt the assisted tax category, and create one consumer financial platform by delivering year-end benefits leading to engagement and monetization. We launched new experiences during the extension season this year, and the results we saw further bolster our account. Turning to the pro tax group, revenue was $39 million in Q1, down 7% as we lapped the period a year ago that included the extended tax filing deadline for most California filers. In summary, I am pleased with our early momentum this fiscal year and our opportunities ahead. Shifting to a balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions. They remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash and investments, and $6.1 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $570 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter to offset dilution from share-based compensation over a three-year period. The board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share payable on January 17, 2025. This represents a 16% increase per share versus last quarter. Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2025 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 12 to 13%, GAAP operating income growth of 28 to 30%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 13 to 14%, GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 18 to 20%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 13 to 14%. GAAP guidance reflects an expected $14 million restructuring charge related to the reorganization we announced in July. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 includes total company revenue growth of 13 to 14%. This includes our expectation of a single-digit decline in consumer group revenue due to some promotional changes in retail channels largely related to our desktop offering. This only impacts revenue timing and does not impact overall unit or revenue expectations for fiscal year 2025. GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 to $0.90 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.61. You can find full fiscal 2025 and Q2 guidance details in a press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I will turn it back over to Sasan. Sasan Goodarzi : Excellent. Thank you, Sandeep. We remain confident in our long-term growth strategy, including double-digit revenue growth and operating income growing faster than revenue. We have a durable advantage with our depth of data and AI capabilities and the strategy to win given the proof points we are observing. And with less than 5% penetration of our $300 billion in TAM, we have a massive runway ahead of us. Let's now open it up to your questions. Operator : At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and two. We will take our first question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. And congrats on a strong start to the year. As we look through the mix, starting the year with about 20% online ecosystem growth, I think, was just barely in line with what some were modeling. How should we think, Sandeep, about the progression and drivers that will get us to your full-year GBS guidance, and what might be the greatest sources of upside? Sandeep Aujla : Brad, thanks for your question. You know, we are off to a great start in the Global Business Solutions Group. You mentioned a 20% online ecosystem revenue growth, which is a two-point acceleration from Q4. And as we look ahead, you know, it's the same things that drove the acceleration. It is continued strong customer engagement of the platform. We saw good retention, low attrition after our price changes. We are seeing good mix shift. I shared that the mid-market grew approximately 42%, and that is driving the improvements and should continue for the remainder of the year. And we are seeing good adoption of our services. So all of those things are what we feel reaffirmed today. Brad Zelnick : Thank you. It's very helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. If I look at TurboTax, marketing expense, in the quarter, I think it was up $46 million year on year. And a strategy that has you out in front of filers even earlier this year and ahead of the season, which, by the way, we see the ads, and I think they're great. Should we think about the overall strategy and expected marketing spend over the full season? Thank you. Sandeep Aujla : Brad, as we shared previously, our strategy with the consumer group is to disrupt the assisted tax category. One of the things that we know for us, we have continued to evaluate the market is many customers make the decision on who they are going to use the following year to do their filing well before January, which is when traditionally the consumer group marketing campaigns would start. With that, and as we shared previously, we started our marketing campaigns earlier, and that has actually driven really strong consideration by what we call prior year assisted, those who got their taxes done through the system method this year. We saw strong lift in traffic and consideration, and even more so in our targeted segments that we are going after for the assisted category. So that reinforced the guidance our belief that that was a good spend, good ROI, and bolsters the confidence for the full year. You should expect us to continue to optimize the spend throughout the entire tax season, and I would expect the consumer group marketing budget should be up slightly but not more so than that. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much. Very helpful. Operator : We will take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on a good start to the year. Sorry to harp on a part of the equation that's not going as well. But on Mailchimp, the churn at the lower end of the base that you mentioned on the call, I don't recall hearing that previously from you guys. So is that a new phenomenon that you're seeing in the marketplace? And on the flip side of the equation, talk to us a little bit about where we are with the integrated sort of, like, the bundled solution? It seems to make there's a lot of industrial logic behind being able to offer your customers both sort of, like, the back end and the front office solution. Together. Where are we in sort of queuing out those synergies and getting that bundle in the market and driving good results in the market? Sandeep Aujla : Hey, Keith. Thanks for your question. Let me take it. You know, first and foremost, when you look at the Intuit Enterprise Suite, Mailchimp is actually part of that suite and available to our customers today. However, in the context of a deeply integrated experience across all of our services, I would say think about the expectation of, you know, several quarters from now, we should be in the marketplace with our, really, end-to-end experience where there's deeper, much depth in the integration of the product, and more importantly, all the data and AI capabilities that allow us to create done-for-you experiences. So think about it as several quarters. We are in sort of final stages of building it out and having customers test it. So that's one element of your question. The second element of your question is the reason we called out churn on the low end is because we've had an incredibly accelerated set of innovation on the platform, particularly for mid-market customers. Some just powerful analytics and segmentation, audience import, SMS capabilities in even more countries. And as we've done that for mid-market customers, which has actually been driving customer growth in the mid-market, it made discovery and usability tougher than it should be for the very, very small customers. And so we have a team that's really focused on first-time use and first-time benefit so that these smaller customers can get the benefit of some of these larger innovations that I just talked about that our mid-market customers are enjoying, and we just wanted to be clear and call it out. Keith Weiss : Got it. And just to be clear, it's more so from sort of is more of an idiosyncratic issue with that innovation and not a broader market commentary or macro weakness. That sometimes you see in smaller customers and more marketing-focused solutions. It's not about the macro. Sandeep Aujla : It is not at all about the macro. It's driven entirely by all of our innovation that is benefiting the larger customers, but, frankly, I think have an opportunity to make the first-time use for smaller customers much better, which is exactly what we're doing. But it is not macro. Keith Weiss : Perfect. Super helpful. Thank you so much. Sandeep Aujla : Yep. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a great start to the year. I want to dig into that online ecosystem and mainly QBO. Online accounting. Good to see that two-point acceleration. But so you guys started this mid-market go-to-market sales team hiring. So wondering where are you in terms of hiring and ramp and have you started seeing, like, the contribution this quarter from that that drove that acceleration? And if so, how should we think about the contribution for subsequent quarters? Is it something we should see now, or will it take a year for that to, you know, for the team to ramp and start contributing revenue? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Siti. Thank you for your question. Let me kick us off. You know, first of all, if you reflect back on what Sandeep talked about earlier, when you look at our overall 20% online ecosystem revenue growth, you know, 42% of that not 42% of it, but we had 42% growth when you look at our QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise platform and all the services that that comes with it. And we wanted to explicitly call that out because as we continue to build out our go-to-market capabilities in the mid-market, it will benefit QBO Advanced and services, and it will benefit, of course, with the enterprise suite. And so we are actually seeing the benefit now, and it's material. We've also added over 200 account managers, business development folks that are very geared towards outside selling and that is contributing to where we are today, but frankly, the biggest contribution of all those investments that we've made are to come. And so we view that in the quarters to come. And therefore, you know, if I were to put a punchline on this, the acceleration that you saw from last quarter to this quarter of 18% to 20% growth with our online ecosystem revenue growth, you know, it came from more services. It came from mid-market, which is both QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise Suite. It came from better retention, higher ARPC, better mix. So we're sort of clicking on all the key cylinders that strategically was communicated to you all. And we expect that to continue. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for the color. And quick follow-up, to your Q2 guidance for consumer. Understand that all the January quarter is a big chunk of that comes from desktop TurboTax. Understand that. But what was the promotion about? What I understand that you guys wanted to push a consumer to online but what's driving the text of promotion? Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. You know, it's first of all, a couple of factors. The primary factor is, you know, typically, we would do promotions from December time frame to middle of January. And really what we've aligned more so this year with our retail partners because this is TurboTax desktop. Is really the buying patterns and the buying behaviors of those consumers that buy our desktop product. What we've done is we've really lined up the promotional time frame that now starts much later in January. And goes beyond January. And that positions us better to deliver for consumers deliver for their buying behaviors, again, on TurboTax desktop. And because of that move, that really shifted revenue into Q3. Our full year is intact. And it just shifted between quarters. And we also, of course, estimate then also the timing of the IRS opening and those factors play into it. But the biggest one is what I just described. And so we feel very bullish and confident about the year and particularly because of what Sandeep articulated. We launched a lot of our lineup changes, our experiences, and our campaign, which we've never tested in the time of the year that we did this year, and frankly, we're more bullish and confident about this coming season than we have been for a while just because a lot of the results that we saw based on everything that we launched. Thank you. Sandeep Aujla : Yeah. Very welcome, Siti. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. One question for each of you, and I think they're kind of tied together. Sasan, the early marketing strategy, you know, saw it earlier than ever before that Brad brought it up when we talked about it a little bit since. It was good, but I think that you had to or you had changed that up a little bit due to NAPP and just curious if you could give us a state of the union on how you are going to market, what that campaign is, and you said that you're seeing early success. If you could just elaborate a little bit more on that. And then, Sandeep, for you, the EPS guide for the upcoming quarter, we're seeing revenue growth in the next quarter, but that is guided down year over year. So if you could just clarify it a little bit more. I think you've given us the big components, but I just if you could talk us through that a little bit. I'll turn it over. Thank you both. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Sure, Scott. Thank you for the question. Let me take the tax element, and then I'll turn it over to Sandeep. You know, first of all, from all the learnings and insights that we've had to really disrupt the assisted tax segment, one element was just really a lot more clarity and precision in terms of timing of decisions. By the customers that somebody else do their taxes for them. And that's what really drove the early marketing campaign. And there were a couple of things we were looking for. One, now that we're in market, does it raise head? Two, will people engage? And three, how much does price matter when you engage sort of preseason? I would tell you that the results were overwhelmingly positive. It raised head. It raised there was engagement better than what we thought. And price was a significant factor. In a very positive way, and that informs the campaign that we are putting together for the season. And really the campaign we're putting together for the season is really about demonstrating what a new way of taxes looks like and what it means and it will focus on experience, speed, and best price. And to specifically answer your question around what we learned, one of the biggest things that we learned in the campaign that we just ran was really the focus is about the new way. The focus is about a better experience, it's about a better price. What we learned is that we have an opportunity to continue to do that, but ensure that it doesn't come across that the experts of the old way is a bad experience because at the end of the day, experts are critical to our experience. The accountants that partner with us, a lot of them are on our platform. The twelve thousand experts that we have on our platform are the very accountants that we partner with and the thing that we learned is to ensure that we really focus on the experience, the speed of it, and the price of it and then not at all depict that the expert in the old way doesn't deliver a great experience or is not a good expert. So that's the learning. That we've had. That's what we are incorporating as we look at the campaign that we're developing. I will just end with the punchline that it worked really well and we're super excited about it. Before I turn it over to Sandeep, I wanted to just use this opportunity since you asked about tax to just address something that I know is on the mind of a few folks, and opportunistically, if I could address it. And that was some of the new news this week around the new administration and whether or not they would create new tax software. Or free tax software. And I just wanted to touch on that while I have the floor. First and foremost, I am personally engaged with the new leaders and the new administration coming in. And what I would share with you is a couple of key priorities that I think all of you have seen in the news, but I personally also learned that really matters to the new leaders and new administration coming in. One is being very aggressive on budget cuts. And workforce reduction. This really streamlined the operations of the government. Two is to really look at the regulatory environment and to reduce the regulatory environment that ultimately will benefit consumers and businesses. Third, we do it's fraud whether it's from identity theft and or loans. And then last but not least is if there's an opportunity to actually simplify the tax code. I'm actually excited about those priorities because those are all priorities that we can help as a company. I would tell you that the last thing that sort of is on the minds of the new leaders coming in is adding to the bureaucracy. And adding to the investment level of something that already exists in private industry. So when it comes to free tax software, as you all know, our stance is it already exists. Private industry has free software available to all Americans. Our perspective and my learning in terms of what's most important. The last thing that the new folks want to do is to add to that bureaucracy and to add investments in an area where the offerings already exist in private industry already serves it. With all that said, free is available to all consumers. And if tomorrow five new free tax offerings become available in the market, it does not have an impact on the structure of the market because free is a commodity for the do-it-yourself category. So I want to just opportunistically touch on that while I have the floor. Sandeep, I'll turn it over to you on EPS. Sandeep Aujla : Sure. Hey, Scott. On the EPS, one thing to keep in mind is that we always optimize our spend for the full year and we continue to feel really solid about our guidance for the year. And as I look internally, how we are leveraging AI and how we work as a company, I see tremendous opportunities for us to continue to expand our margin. Now let me address your question on Q2 specifically. This is a continuation and all on strategy on the things that we talked about as it relates to Q1. In the consumer group, we have continued our marketing opportunities. Historically, they would have started in the January time frame, and now they're starting they're continuing through November and December, which wasn't there the past year. Credit Karma is in a very different position this year. Last year, Q1, we were negative 5%. This year, 29%. We're seeing partners lean in, we are also leaning into our go-to-market and our marketing campaigns there and seeing exceptionally strong ROIs and payback periods there. And lastly, in the Global Business Solutions Group, we touched on the approximately 200 people that we have in the mid-market. You know, so that's now in our run rate from Q1 heading into Q2. You know, of course, we'll scale that only as we see ROI and payback periods that are palatable to us. But the other thing on the Global Business Solutions Group to keep in mind is last year, the campaigns took us a little longer to come into market. This year, our campaigns were ready earlier, and the team decided to go into market earlier because there were opportunities for us to get even better ROI by optimizing that spend through all four quarters. As opposed to last year when we leaned in more towards the January busy season. So those are again, your key takeaway should be all of this is in line with our strategy. And we continue to have lots of confidence in our full-year path to margin expansion as a company. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thank you both for all the color and, Sasan, for that extra color. I'm very well put. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Thanks for the clarity from me as well, Sasan. My question is on the payment. If you look at the payment volumes, yeah, if I heard you correctly, it was 17% decelerated a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes there? Because, you know, obviously, you revamped the payment platform. And so, you know, that should be an area of healthy growth going forward as well. Like, how do I have to think about that number? In that context? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Thank you for the question. A couple of things I would say. One, our momentum around our innovation around money. And payments being one, you know, element of it. Continues to be an area where we're very bullish, particularly as we penetrate with services, not only with small businesses but also in mid-market. There were a couple of factors that played into the 17% for the first quarter. One is the storms on the East Coast. Actually impacted a lot of service-based small businesses. Saw the impact, and we actually saw it start to come back. So that's one element. And also another element is just the number of days that fell into this quarter versus the same quarter last year. So those factors played into it, and expect it to, in essence, accelerate as we look ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Perfect. And then the other question I had was as you kind of said earlier, Sasan, you're kind of now, like, you know, more an AI platform. If you think about tax season or QB and the QBO business as well, how do you think about, like, the next iteration for how you weave that into the product to kind of keep the customer longer in the funnel, etcetera? Is there any big changes we can expect for the tax season? I'm not asking you to kind of fill it out. But is there, like, do you think about that evolution of weaving that into the product? Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Great question. You know, first of all, just briefly start with the context of, our entire strategy as a company is to create done-for-you experiences. Marketing is done for you. Quote to cash is done for you. Your books are done for you. Your accounting is done for you, your taxes are done for you, and connecting you to financial products that are right for you as a consumer are done for you with the customer always in control. And always in the path to an AI-powered human expert. That's the fundamental essence of our strategy to serve consumers, small businesses, and mid-market customers and the whole premise of our investments around data and AI has been towards that. You asked about tax, but let me just start thirty seconds with our excitement around Intuit Assist, in essence, done-for-you experiences being available to all of our business customers now. It has been an incredible amount of work, and the reaction from our small businesses has been overwhelmingly positive. You know, today, now all of our small businesses can take an email. They can take a picture of a handwritten note. They can take any file and we will create on their behalf an estimate, an invoice, a bill, we will do the accounting for them in the background and match and categorize everything for them. We will ultimately help them if they're a construction company on the road. Tax to pay for the handwritten note that you just took a picture of and get paid right there on the job site. Be able to help them with where they're gonna have cash flow shortfalls and make it immediately a line of credit. That's now all Intuit Assist. The Gen AI-powered assistant that will do the work for our customers is generally available for all of our customers. That's a huge deal. You can imagine, as we look ahead, our goal is to create a done-for-you experience across the entire platform, across Mailchimp and QuickBooks and all of the services. To answer your question around tax, I think what I would say is you will see this year, based on all of the investments that we've made over the last several years, leveraging data and AI to dramatically streamline experiences by how we leverage data and how we streamline getting right to the refund. It'll make it far more superior and easy. Our focus is the best experience, the fastest and at the best price for those that want to do it themselves. But also for those that want our experts to do it for them. So our are gonna be far more effective in addition gonna be able to get your taxes done in less than an hour. At the best price, all of which is the result of all of the data and AI investments and revamped experiences that we will have in season this year. Raimo Lenschow : Good. Looking forward to that. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Taylor McGinnis : Yeah. Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. So if I look at the operating margin guide for the second half, it looks higher than what you guys have done in past years. So when we just think about the seasonality of this year's because compared to some past years, is the messaging that is that, you know, you're seeing more front-end loading of expenses compared to last, and that should drive stronger growth in the second half. Maybe you can just talk about some of the drivers in the second half expansion, you know, despite some of the continued scaling on the go-to-market investments in other areas? Thanks. Sandeep Aujla : Sure. Hey, Taylor. So the investments that we started early on, both on the consumer side, as I shared, that drove a lot of head lifters with the prior year, assisted that you know, came to our side. So that is something that will pay dividends as we get into the tax season. The sales force that we are building in mid-market can imagine building hiring those two hundred people. There's a training component to it. There's an efficiency component to it, but that Salesforce gets more and more effective week by week by week. So that helps drive more dividends as we get into the back half. And then on the Global Business Solutions Group, the team looked at the spend and is optimizing the spend to drive consideration, drive people and customers into the platform that then will add on services. And as you know, from having followed the company for a long time, services take a while to ramp up as they onboard their employees as bring their payment volumes onto a rails. So it is all consistent with our strategy, which is to optimize the spend to match to that the trajectory continues to strengthen into the back half. Taylor McGinnis : Perfect. Thank you so much. Sasan Goodarzi : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Turrin : Hey. Great. Thanks very much. Appreciate you taking the questions. So, Sasan, I'm gonna give you a chance to go back to assist. We've seen the QuickBook announcements as well. Was hoping you could just level set for us how you're thinking about capturing the value of those, whether it's through monetization or just other costs or economic benefits you're observing as you start to get those tools in the hands of more of your customers. Sasan Goodarzi : And, Michael, are you referring to the Intuit Assist that we just announced this week? Is that what you're referring to? Michael Turrin : I am. Yep. Sasan Goodarzi : Got it. Yep. Absolutely. So I would say, you know, the biggest thing that we learned having this in the hands of, you know, two million customers before we made it generally available and also, experiences that we had in beta alpha for new prospects there's really, I would say, two big outcomes improved conversion improved retention, and, really, a third outcome, which is improved adoption of services. Those are and those if you think about back to what Sandeep and I shared, I think it was eighteen months ago at investor day, our perspective around creating done-for-you experiences with Intuit Assist believe will lead to new customer growth, it'll lead to higher adoption of services and we believe over time, there could be offering stand-alone SKUs that are completely they do all the work for you and they could be separate price SKUs. What we've proven so far to ourselves is this creates new customer growth, it could create better retention, but also creates better adoption of services. So like, if you think about what we just launched this week, which is you can take an email, a photo of a handwritten note or a file and create an estimate, an invoice, and create a bill, that all drives bill pay and payments. Growth as an illustrative example. So those are the things that we've learned as we've been sort of in beta and alpha and now that we're in GA, particularly what we expect this coming season in TurboTax new customer growth, adoption of our services, is what we see as the outcome and why we're so excited as we look ahead. Michael Turrin : Great. If I can just ask on the Credit Karma bounce back, I don't based on what you're seeing, is there any way to help just split how much of that is macro versus something product-specific you've maybe incorporated into the experience there and maybe just help level set what you're seeing today versus what you're guiding for the rest of the year given the fiscal year guide now sits below the run rate you just put up this quarter? Thank you. Sandeep Aujla : Yeah. Absolutely. Michael, I would you know, if a blend of both. If I had to attribute it, I'll say it's fifty-fifty now. On the personal loan side, having a more stable rate environment absolutely helps, and we saw partners lean into testing and lean into lending on the platform. But it's also try to goes to the team the product team and the go-to-market team at Credit Karma as an investor into driving the right experiences and driving engagement across the platform. And as they added more segments such as the insurance segment, which has been quite strong starting Q3 last year, I would say it's a blend, and I would probably blend it at about a fifty-fifty mix. Michael Turrin : Helpful. Thank you. Sandeep Aujla : Very welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. Sasan, I wanted to get your take on just the notion and the topic of what you're seeing in your business right now from an SMB demand environment perspective, kind of are you starting to see the beginnings of a recovery? How and when do you expect that to show up? And on the very fast-developing agendaic opportunity for kind of AI utilization, monetization in your customer base. When do you believe or strongly think we should start seeing impacts from a monetization standpoint, both with Assist around either does it change the magnitude? Does it change the strategy? Over the next few quarters? Sasan Goodarzi : Yep. Great. Thank you, Alex. For the question. I'll take the first one I would say a couple of things. One, it's a stable environment. Our belief, which is not baked into our guidance, is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in 2025. Hear just what some of the things that I mentioned earlier around just interest rates, jobs, you know, the regulatory environment, you know, these things have a real burden on businesses, and we believe that, you know, a better future is to come. None of which we're baking and assuming, but important to say. So stable. We believe the future will be better and I would just end by saying really, the growth that we are experiencing. If you look at our overall guidance for the year in our business franchise of 16 to 17% and then the 20% online revenue growth that we delivered in Q1 and that we would expect, you know, the rest of the year. That's all because of the power of our platform and the innovation on our platform that is actually saving customers money because they're digitizing their entire business and are able to run and grow their business in one place rather than multiple apps where they don't they spend a bunch of money. They don't really understand how their business is performing. And we're digitizing that with our platform. And so our growth that you are that we're reporting, that you're experiencing is all because of our innovation. And we believe that as things demand starts improving, we think that will be impactful positively to our results. The second element, you know, of your question, you listen, our core thesis that we have proven over the years and particularly internally as we just launched Intuit Assist and made it generally available to all, is that the more we can do the work for customers, the more we will drive new customers into the franchise. The more we will drive penetration of services. And if you look at Intuit Enterprise Suite, you know, the biggest thing that we're learning from customers is they love the experience. Our AI agents are doing the work for them, helping them understand the performance of their business, helping them provide insights into things that may happen and actions that they do they should take. Those are all our AI agents. And we believe our AI agents can ultimately do, you know, the enable them to do the work of a CFO, of a CMO, of a sales officer, all of these midsize businesses. And to get to the essence of your question, we haven't baked any of that into our year. We believe that these are gonna be contributors of growth into the future, and, of course, our desire is accelerating growth. Alex Zukin : Very helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up for Sandeep. So is it as simple to say basically that the maybe slightly smaller earnings beat that we're typically alright. That we keep it typically see when you have revenue outperformance to the magnitude that you've shown and the guide for Q2 on earnings being a bit lighter than consensus, is that just effectively mostly associated with the timing of incremental spend for some of your newer initiatives. And some of the hiring from a go-to-market perspective. Is that is it more just shifting timing to the first half to Taylor's point? Sandeep Aujla : Alex, that's exactly right. We always have sometimes things if you remember last year, Q1, we had some items move out of the quarter. This year, we had some items move in. We saw opportunities in areas such as Credit Karma to, you know, lean into investments earlier than we would have just given the behavior we were seeing from the partners. So all to say, we opt again, we optimize spend for the year. And when we saw revenue uplift, I gave it a little bit more flexibility to lean into Q1. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Sasan Goodarzi : Yep. Thank you, Alex. Operator : We will take our next question from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Sandeep, in the quarter, money represented well over half of the growth in online services. Should we expect that to continue here for the rest of the year? Or will the next shift? Sandeep Aujla : You know, Brad, we don't, of course, guide by age subsegment, but we could feel very, bullish and confident in our money strategy which includes, of course, payments, bill pay, and capital. The momentum you pointed out, has been strong in Q1 and expect that to continue throughout the year. And, you know, what I would point you back to is that confidence. Our utmost confidence in the 20% online ecosystem growth for the year as we can continue to scale the business, and the money portfolio is gonna be a key contributor is a key contributor to that confidence. Brad Reback : Got it. And just one follow-up. Given Sasan's comments on Mailchimp and your comment right there in the overall confidence in the 20%. It would feel like the recovery in Mailchimp is more a driver next year, than needed for this year. Sandeep Aujla : I would think about the Mailchimp as a several-quarter journey. We really want the team to nail the first-time use experience. We have internal KPIs all around customer behavior and all related to FTE first-time use, FTU, what we call internally. So, yes, that's something that you know, we are being patient with because we wanted the team to focus on the customer experience, so that's not something that we are banking on, you know, for the conference I shared in the 20%. Brad Reback : Awesome. Thanks very much. Sandeep Aujla : Very welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Sasan, just on the mid-market, I you mentioned a couple of in one of the deals in the earlier remarks. But I'm just curious if you can give us more of an update in terms of, you know, where you're at, kind of mile markers, and I think there's some fear among investors that this is a much lower margin business. This is gonna require a heavier lift in a different And So if you could just comment on that on how you spell long-term dynamics of that plays out. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah, Brent. Thank you for your question. I in fact, I would say it's the reverse. It is very high margin, very lucrative, high ARPC, and it's very similar to, I think, the concerns investors had four, five years ago when we talked about disrupting the assisted category. And how we would do that given we're talking about experts. And I would tell you that the answer that we gave then and the answer I'll give you now, there are a lot of parallels. The essence of our scale is because of all of our data and best platform services. When you look at QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise, Suite, it's actually fueled by a lot of the platform services that we have built over the last several years. And therefore, when you look at the only thing that we are sort of adding is a couple of hundred folks that are in sales to really capture the opportunity. The effectiveness and the efficiency that we have on the other side because of data and AI is significant. And so this is actually quite lucrative. It's very high ARPC. It's not only new customers but existing customers upgrading. The service opportunity is massive. So when you look at the fact that it's a platform driven by all the services that we already have coupled with higher ARPC, it's actually far more lucrative. Than just when you look at our QBO base. So we actually expected to play a dual role. Number one, to continue to accelerate our growth as you heard Sandeep talk about earlier. Overall. Online revenue growth was 20% and advanced and enterprise suite are growing 42% along with the services. That actually has even a second benefit, which is higher contribution over time to margin. So it's actually the reverse of the concern that you articulated, very similar to when we shared in a couple of investor days ago, that the variable margin of, our TurboTax five was actually higher. Than just the TurboTax on its own. We believe the same will play out here. Brent Thill : Great answer. Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yep. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. On the QuickBooks Enterprise Suite, it's clearly showing robustness. Sasan, how's the early response you're seeing if you can speak to the $20,000 ARPC I mentioned earlier because you had mentioned a couple of, I think, surprisingly large customer wins. On the call today. And I'm just wondering if you can comment on the response to some of the advanced functionality that relates to multiple locations and entities and consolidated segment reporting. Sasan Goodarzi : Yeah. Mark, the way I would answer your question is I know, frequently will engage our large accountant and accounting firms and these large businesses, and I had the pleasure and the opportunity to engage a lot of them in a couple of day bear period very recently at Intuit Connect. And, listen, I don't want to downplay what I'm about to say, but money is actually not the object. Here. These businesses, you know, when I spoke to the CFOs of these businesses or the owners of these businesses, the words that they use is you've changed my life as a business. This is a game changer. For really two, I would say, significant reasons. You know, one, can actually see how their business is performing. So put it aside that they go from days of trying to consolidate and understand how their business is performing to now minutes, but knowing how their business is performing every day. Having insights and recommendations from us to inform their decisions is actually quite significant. The other is when you go from using multiple apps and point solutions everything is in one place, the amount of digitization that happens across all of your money movement, whether it's bill pay, whether it's payments, whether it's payroll, and having all of that inform your dashboard every day is a complete game changer. So the biggest thing that we hear from them is actually about more things they would like to see and from new customers that are in sectors that we don't yet serve. How can we serve them far more quickly because they're dying to get on into an enterprise suite? So that's the way I would sort of describe the reaction. The other thing that we're working on, and I'll just end with this, is making sure we also provide capabilities to fuel the success of accountants. And our sort of monetization model for accountants that not only is good for them, but good for us to really together be able to serve the market together. And we're excited about both. Mark Murphy : Thank you. Sasan Goodarzi : Yep. You're very welcome. Operator : And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn the program back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Sasan Goodarzi : Alright. Well, awesome. Thank you. Listen, everybody. Thank you for your time. Thank you for all your questions. Be safe, and we'll see you soon. Bye, everybody. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Kim Watkins : Goodbye.",
