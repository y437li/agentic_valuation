Mark Lipacis \u2013 Jefferies & Company Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Christopher Danely \u2013 JPMorgan Securities  Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura Securities Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs Vivek Arya - Banc of America Merrill Lynch Stacy Rasgon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein  Eric Rasmus \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir. Ron Slaymaker : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. The first quarter was a good start to the year for TI. Our positions in analog and embedded processing contributed strongly, with combined revenue for these products up 13% from a year ago. As important markets such as industrial and automotive continued to embrace electronics technology, analog and embedded processing products are critical and TI should benefit accordingly. Revenue of $2.98 billion was in the upper half of our expected range that we communicated in January. Earnings per share of $0.44 was at the top of our expected range. EPS included $0.02 that was not in our prior guidance from sales of a site and other assets associated with previously announced restructuring actions. Free cash flow was $3.1 billion or 25% of revenue for the trailing 12 months period, right in line with the 20% to 30% range where we expect to operate over time. For those of you who missed our capital management call in March, we raised our expected range for free cash flow margins from 20% to 25% to 20% to 30% in that call. Also over the past 12 months, we returned over $4 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In the March call, Kevin explained that our updated model for cash returns to shareholders was to return all of our free cash flow less the net debt amount that is retired plus proceeds that we received from exercises of equity compensation. Inclusion of the exercise proceeds was a new addition to the model from what we had previously communicated. Against this targeted return level, we returned 99% over the past 12 months. In the first quarter, TI revenue grew 3% from a year ago. Excluding legacy wireless, revenue grew 11% with double digit growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago with all four major product lines up. Power management and high performance analog led this growth, and were each up about the same amount. Embedded processing revenue grew 17% from a year ago with micro-controllers leading the way. Our increased investments in this growth area over the past few years are yielding favorable results. In our other segment, revenue declined $186 million or 28% from a year ago due to legacy wireless which has now declined to the single digit millions of dollars.  Turning to distribution, Resales increased 10% from a year ago, while distributors\u2019 inventory remained about the same and it\u2019s just under five and a half weeks. From an end market perspective, the most growth from a year ago came from communications equipment, followed by industrial and automotive.  Enterprise Systems was about even, while revenue in personal electronics declined due to mobile phones and tablets, areas that previously used legacy wireless products from TI.  Now Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Kevin March : Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.61 billion or 53.9% of revenue. Gross profit increased 17% from the year ago quarter. This was a solid increase in profitability, considering the 3% growth in total revenue. The 630 basis point expansion in gross margin as a percentage of revenue reflects an improved product portfolio, higher utilization of our manufacturing assets and the efficiency of our manufacturing operations. Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $845 million was down $33 million from a year ago. The decline reflects restructuring associated with the wind down of our legacy wireless products. As a reminder, we will begin to see the benefit of the previously announced restructuring in a better processing and Japan in the second half of this year. While we are discontinuing R&D spending in the areas that are no longer able to provide differentiated growth, we continue to invest aggressively in those areas that are providing growth such as analogue where we\u2019ve increased our R&D investments by 77% since 2006, resulting in steady increases in market share. Or as Ron mentioned, more recently with our stepped up investments in embedded processing, which is now resulting in multiple quarters of year over year revenue growth. Moving on, acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which is the ongoing amortization of intangibles and non-cash expense. Restructuring and other charges included a charge of $32 million for the previously announced restructuring about as we expected. There was also a gain $37 million for sales of the site and other assets associated with earlier restructuring actions. As Ron mentioned, this gain contributed $0.2 to EPS in the quarter and was not included in our prior guidance. Operating profit was $690 million or 23.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 75% from the year ago. Again, this was a solid increase considering total revenue was up 3% over this period. Net income in the first quarter was $487 million or 0.44 per share.  Let me now comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $462 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 112, consistent with our model of 105 days to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $77 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 months basis, cash flow from operations was $3.49 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $405 million or 3% of revenue. Capital spending for the year ago trailing 12 month period was $476 million or 4% of revenue. Consequently, free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.08 billion or 25% of revenue in the middle of our expected 20% to 30% range. This is 8% higher than the free cash flow was a year ago when it was 23% of revenue.  Depreciation expense for the past 12 months was $864 million. Depreciation exceeded our capital expenditures by $459 million or 3.7% of revenue. Our strategy to opportunistically time our purchases of manufacturing equipment has provided us a manufacturing capability today that has sufficient headroom to support growth for years ahead. Our current level of capital expenditures, provide us with important new manufacturing technologies while also continuing to expand our capacity. Over the next few years, as a result of this strategy, we expect to continue to hold capital spending at low levels or at about 4% of revenue. Therefore depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending and our gross margin will directly benefit.  As we have said, strong cash flow, particularly free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide significant cash returns to our shareholders. In the first quarter, TI paid $325 million in dividends and repurchased $720 million of our stock for a total return of $1.05 billion. Historically we have described our capital management strategy was to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders except for what we need to repay debt. In March we updated this model to also include the return of proceeds that we received from the exercise of equity compensation. In the past 12 months, free cash flow was $3.08 billion.  Our debt level was essentially unchanged and we received $1.14 billion of proceeds from exercises. So our target of return model would be about $4.22 billion. We actually returned $4.18 billion to shareholders on a 99% of the model. So our recent practice has been well [aligned] with the updated model. This percentage will likely move up in the second quarter as we retire debt that is due in May. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was 38% higher than a year ago.  Dividends were up 48% and stock repurchases were up 34%. Fundamental for our cash strategy and our cash management, are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $4.03 billion of cash and short term investments, with 84% of that amount owned by TI\u2019s U.S. entities. Because our cash is largely on-shore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. As a reminder, we issued $500 million of debt in the first quarter at an average coupon rate of 1.8% for three and seven year terms. And we plan to retire $1 billion when it comes due in May.  TI\u2019s orders in the quarter were $3.07 billion up 4% from a year ago and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.03.  Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.14 billion to $3.40 billion in the second quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 7% from a year ago. If you exclude the $148 million of legacy wireless revenue from the year ago quarter, revenue would increase 13%. We expect second-quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.63. Restructuring charges will be essentially nil and acquisition charges will remain about even which is a non-cash amortization charge that will be at this level for the next five years. We have revised our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 to 28%, up a point from our prior estimate, reflecting our high expectation for profitability in the year. This is the tax rate that you should use for the second quarter. In summary, I think the first quarter provided a glimpse into the potential financial performance that TI should be capable of going forward. Our Analog and Embedded Processing product lines will benefit as the industrial and automotive markets continue to increasingly embrace technology. These are markets where we\u2019re investing that offer the promise of sustainable growth, solid profitability and good cash flow from operations. The low capital requirements for Analog and Embedded Processing, combined with our strategy to opportunistically acquire manufacturing assets, also means that we can deliver strong free cash flows, which would allow us to continue to provide strong returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  With that, let me turn it back to Ron. Ron Slaymaker : Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : (Operator Instructions) and we go first to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse.: Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me open the questioning. Congratulations on the strong results. Kevin, helpful on giving us topline and bottom line guiding for the June quarter. I\u2019m just kind of curious, as we think about gross margin and OpEx, how does the OpEx saving kind of [linearly] fold into the model between now and December? And on the gross margin lines, should we just think about sort of that 75% historical incremental gross margin against revenue growth? Kevin March : So John, let me start with the OpEx. As you look into the next quarter in particular, recall that in the ... just to step back for a moment. On an annual basis, we typically have our pay and benefit increases occurring in the first quarter. And typically, two of the three months of the first quarter will incur that increase. So clearly as we go into second quarter, we\u2019ll have a full three months of that increase. But to the point that you were bringing up on some of the savings that we\u2019ll see from the restructuring in Embedded Processing actions, we\u2019ll see a little bit of that savings begin to materialize in the second quarter. So OpEx will probably be fairly flat. The majority of that savings will occur in the second half of the year. And just to remind everyone else, we\u2019re expecting about $130 million in annualized savings as a result of that announced restructuring. On the gross profit, it\u2019s exactly as you said John. You should be thinking that over the course of the cycle, our fall through average is about on the way up and on the way down. So that\u2019s a good long term model to be using as you build your model. Ron Slaymaker : Follow on, John? John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities : Yeah. Ron, maybe you can help me out a bit. Given the reclassification of revenue you guys did, I\u2019m just kind of curios, how does a mix influence gross margin? And if you think about the new buckets of revenue, where do you expect to see faster, longer term growth versus slower, longer term growth, either by design or just by market forces? Ron Slaymaker : Okay. And when you talk about our reclassification of revenue, are you talking about by end market or are you talking by -_ John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities : By end markets specifically, Ron. Thank you. Ron Slaymaker : Okay. Even though was end market, let me first of all address that more by product line. So the biggest mix change has been as we\u2019ve gotten out of legacy wireless. And even though that\u2019s essentially zero as of first quarter, you\u2019ll still see the impact on the year-on-year comparison through the course of 2014. And in general the legacy wireless gross margins were lower than corporate average. So getting out of that, those product areas was beneficial to gross margin. From and end marker stand point probably the way to think about it is that gross margins tend to be highest and this is not unique to TI; you can just look across a broader range of companies, but gross margins tend to be highest where volumes tend to be lowest.  Meaning where -- maybe the better way to say it is where the revenue is most diversified across customers and application areas so for example, industrial. You can see other companies that are highly focused on industrial and we see it in our own results where you\u2019re selling catalogue products into lots and lots of different customers and different applications within the industrial space and that tends to be at pretty nice gross margins. Other areas like automotive where there are a lot of special requirements from the standpoint of quality, the design end cycles tend to be long. The product life cycle both in automotive and in industrial tend to be long and that tends to be beneficial for gross margins also.  They probably tend to be lowest in the short cycle, high volume end market areas and that\u2019s partly the nature of the competitiveness of those opportunities, combined with you don\u2019t really have time in terms of the life cycle of the product to engineer in cost reductions, to get gross margins where you would really like to see them over time. And so there\u2019s lots of examples of that and again you see it in our own results and you would see it probably more broadly with other companies. So if you say where you would expect to see highest growth over time, I would say just make a couple of observations. I think both industrial and automotive from an application area, from their embracement of electronics technology, they\u2019re at a tipping point where those very likely will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets going forward just by nature of the provision of semiconductor technology inside those applications. Now I would also say that we have a good position in those markets and we believe analogue and embedded are important. And we also believe frankly our sales force and the breadth sales force is an important competitive advantage for TI in reaching especially in the industrial markets, a broad base of customers there.  So probably not surprisingly and you\u2019ve heard us say for some time now, they are priority areas for TI in terms of investment and in terms of our expected penetration into those markets and applications. And that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that their revenue will grow faster as a percentage of TI\u2019s total because you never know what will happen in a particular high volume market. But over time I think you would expect that our position in those markets get stronger and over time the percent of our revenue that is coming from industrial and automotive will continue to grow as well.  Okay. John, thanks for the questions and let\u2019s move to the next caller. Operator : And we move next to Mark Lipacis with Jeffrey\u2019s. Mark Lipacis \u2013 Jefferies & Company: Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I apologize if I\u2019m asking you to repeat what you\u2019ve read in your script, but could you just walk through the mechanics of the capital return for this quarter? You have the debt that you\u2019re going to pay down, but you issued some. So I understand that the free cash flow plus the proceeds from the options minus the debt services is what you expect to return. So if you have $1 billion, do we just subtract that $1 billion or do we also factor in the $500 million in debt that you issued this quarter as part of that pay down? Kevin March : Mark, let me try to get to the way you\u2019re trying to ask that question. Again at the high level, I\u2019ll repeat what you said there. Our cash return strategy is to return 100% of the free cash flow, less any amount used for net debt retirement plus proceeds that we get from stock option exercises. During this past quarter or during this past 12 months, there was virtually no net debt retirement. So it was really the proceeds from free cash flow plus the stock option exercises was virtually all -- we returned all of that to the shareholders in the last 12 months, 99% of that to the shareholders.  As you move into second quarter, we do have $1 billion of debt that\u2019s coming due on May that we\u2019ll go ahead and pay off. And so when you re-run that math, you\u2019ll see some usage over that trailing 12 months of cash for debt retirement. And just mathematically that says the percentage we return by the time we get to the end of second quarter will probably be in excess of 100%, probably in excess of 110%. But that\u2019s just timing and as you go through the course of the year that will net itself as we move on through the year. Mark Lipacis \u2013 Jefferies & Company: Let me just ask a clarification, Kevin. So in a quarter where you pay down debt, does that immediately come right out of repurchases or is it a more smoothing type of application in terms of the way you look at the return formula? Kevin March : It\u2019s a more smoothing type of application. It will not affect the timing of our repurchases. We will continue to do repurchases, as you\u2019ve seen us in the past, which is a very steady hand, constant hand as we go through time. And we don\u2019t try to time our repurchases. We just try to be very steady and methodical about it. Ron Slaymaker : Do you have a follow up, Mark? Mark Lipacis \u2013 Jefferies & Company: Yeah, I did and thanks for asking that clarification, Ron. I appreciate that. In trying to model the cash flows through the year, normally you have Q1. You have accounts payable and accounts receivable are a big use of cash, which they were this quarter and then in Q4 accounts receivable becomes a nice source of cash. Is it fair to assume that that typical pattern is what we would expect to see? And is there any other working capital shifts that might happen this year that\u2019s different than what you\u2019ve historically had? Thank you. Kevin March : Mark, I think you\u2019ve identified that quite well. Typically our first and second quarters are our lowest for cash flow and operating cash flow and free flow cash generation. First quarter we had pay and benefit increases as I mentioned earlier. We also pay out our profit share and our performance bonuses during the first quarter. Then the second quarter, we of course have estimated tax payments that we have to make for the year that uses some cash, but as we travel through the year, our operating cash and our free cash flow have a tendency to increase, first to second to third to fourth and then decline again. And I don\u2019t see anything in 2014 that would suggest that would be any different than what we\u2019ve seen for a number of years now. Ron Slaymaker : Okay Mark. Thank you for your question. Let\u2019s move to the next caller. Operator : We move to Doug Freedman with RBC Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Hi guys. Congrats on the strong results and thanks for letting me ask a question. If I could, could you dig into a little bit what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the mix of product, whether it be ASPs units, and then a little bit of insight into maybe your back log , what you\u2019re seeing in lead times book-to-bill and maybe the projected turns that you need to meet the mid-point? Kevin March : I can maybe give you a little bit on that. In terms of ASPs Mark, Doug, excuses me, I\u2019m really not aware that there\u2019s been any significant shift one way or the other. And again that just tends to shift that take place on ASPs when you have differentiated products such as we do, tend to be more driven by mix than they would general pricing environment you might say or a competitive pricing environment. Again no substantial shift there other than when you look over time on, the longer term impact of moving out of legacy wireless. Lead times are generally stable. At any point in time you always have some mixed differences that might cause lead times to move in or out for one product area versus another. But generally lead times are stable and for TI what that means is the majority of our products are shipping with lead times of less than six weeks. Ron Slaymaker : I\u2019ll comment on backlog. Doug, you asked about that. We came into last quarter with a book-to-bill of 0.94 and we\u2019ve come into this quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.03. So clearly we\u2019ve got a little bit more visibility than we had last quarter or even the quarter before that. Just to put that in perspective, orders in the quarter -- I think we mentioned earlier we are up about 4% year over year. That works out to being up about 7% quarter over quarter. So with those combined elements from a backlog standpoint, that leads to expect that we will have pretty reasonable growth in total revenues as we go in second quarter as indicated by the guidance that we\u2019ve included with this release. Kevin March : And I know I\u2019ve said this before, but let me just remind you that with the 1.03 book-to-bill, today about 45% of our revenue is supported by consignment and JIT programs. And so for that revenue, book-to-bill is always 1.0. So the 1.03 is a blend of really only the revenue that\u2019s non-JIT or non-consignment which is 55% of our revenue. So if I just round and call that half of our revenue, the book-to-bill on those products that would be shipping on traditional backlog and order entry type process would be more like a 1.06, the total being a 1.03 because that 1.06 then gets blended with the JIT consignment products at a 1.0 book-to-bill. Ron Slaymaker : Okay. Hopefully that helped and didn\u2019t further confuse. Did you have a follow on, Doug? Doug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Great. Thanks Ron. No. That was excellent color, I really do appreciate it. My follow on is really about sort of the cost of running the business. I know that you guys have executed your restructuring plan to lower some of the cost, but how should I think about the cost in OpEx going forward in relation to say revenue growth? If revenue growth continues at say double digit pace, does the core OpEx grow with that same double digit pace or is there some leverage there? Kevin March : Yeah. Doug, I think that we do have some leverage certainly in 2014 and that is the restructuring that we announced in [beta] processing and Japan. That mostly will kick in during the second half. So again just to remind you, that\u2019s $130 million of annualized savings that we expect to capture by the end of the year. So as we roll into next year we\u2019ll see it on an annual basis. That $130 million will spread roughly 65% in R&D, 20% in SG&A and the balance of 15% in cost of revenue and cost of goods sold. So we\u2019re kind of spread that way. Beyond 2014, again I think we\u2019ve commented a couple of times on prior calls our basic model for OpEx is to operate between 20% and 30% of revenue. So it will not go up or down necessarily at the same pace that revenue goes up or down. It will be more of a steady change over time, but some of these one off anomalies like I just described with the restructuring going on in a [beta] processing and Japan. Ron Slaymaker : Okay. Doug, thank you. Let\u2019s move to the next caller. Operator : We move to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan. Christopher Danely \u2013 JPMorgan Securities : Can you give us your thoughts on the relative growth rates of your analogue versus embedded versus your -- I guess your other category this year? And then maybe talk about just the various puts and takes of why embedded was up so much, analogue was up a little bit less and the other was down so much this quarter? Ron Slaymaker : Chris, are you asking for comments on forward looking or kind of why the historical results were what they were? Christopher Danely \u2013 JPMorgan Securities : Both will be great. If I had to choose one I\u2019d say forward, but both would be great. Ron Slaymaker : Okay. Forward will be short discussion because we have -- really I can say legacy wireless will continue down through the rest of this year when compared against the year ago period. But it\u2019s zero already. So I think the reality is it\u2019ll be what it\u2019ll be. You\u2019ll see certain times when Analog grows faster than Embedded. You\u2019ll see periods where Embedded grows faster than Analog. I think Kevin even in his opening remarks mentioned that. I think it was back in 2010 where we stepped up investments in Embedded because we believed there was a great growth opportunity for TI and microcontrollers. We have answered questions from you guys for a long time about where\u2019s the growth that goes along with that stepped up investment. And frankly I think we\u2019re starting to see it now.  It make sense because it takes time first of all for that R&D to translate to products and then for products to get designed into customers and them to get their products to the market. I think what we\u2019re seeing now in Embedded, very specifically in the micro controller area has to do with the stepped up investments that we made a few years ago in microcontrollers. Certainly also what\u2019s helping Embedded is I think we mentioned that from an end market standpoint, we\u2019re seeing strength in communications equipment as well. And clearly the DSP position, our processor position we have in Embedded across pretty much all of the various OEM\u2019S that ship into that wireless base station market are benefiting now in terms of that market starting to lift for us.  In terms of Analog, the same thing. You\u2019ll see over time periods where power grows faster. In fact probably that would be a trend that you\u2019d say if you look over an extended period of time, meaning five years or so power has pretty consistently led growth in Analog. And we think that\u2019s an opportunity that will just continue in the years ahead. That has to do with the world wanting to get greener in terms of power efficiency and it has to do with a lot more products in the end market becoming battery power and that\u2019s a great power management opportunity for TI. Our leadership in that market means that as that market lifts, we probably tend to lift more than most other players. Outside of that, what we\u2019re doing in Silicon Valley Analog, what we\u2019re doing in high performance Analog, both those areas in the industrial market are very clear beneficiaries of the industrial market continuing to lift. So I\u2019ll stop there. Those are some general comments. But again we don\u2019t really try to mention it, Chris. We have certain areas like industrial and automotive that are important to us, but frankly pretty much every product area, whether it\u2019s application specific products or processors or catalogue analog devices can reach into industrial and can reach into automotive and be beneficiaries of that strategy going forward.  Do you have a follow on, Chris? Christopher Danely \u2013 JPMorgan Securities : Yeah and I hopped on a little late. So I\u2019m sorry if you already talked about it. But can you just go over what utilization rates were during the quarter, what you\u2019re expecting them to be this quarter? And then given all the restructuring and fads et cetera, maybe just refresh us on what your sort of peak revenue level is and where you would need to start adding equipment in terms of a utilization level? Kevin March : Chris, on utilization again we haven\u2019t disclosed the actual percentage utilization in quite some time. We tend to do that when it\u2019s really a dramatic change, it\u2019s informative. I will just say that our factory utilization from a stats basis was higher in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter, but the average wafers that moved through the factories was about the same in both quarters. So, consequently the underutilization charge was the same in both quarters, both fourth quarter and first quarter at about $105 million. With the outlook that we have for the second quarter with the guidance that we\u2019ve offered, clearly we have been and we\u2019ll continue to increase the loadings in the factories to support the increased expected outlook revenue growth in the second quarter. And then just to the last part of your question there, the installed capacity that we have today is equipped to the point to support we believe about $18 billion of revenue. As we go forward, we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to increase capacity at the lowest possible cost as we have done for a number of years now so that we can remain focused on maximizing continuous free cash flow over time as opposed to trying to maximize factory utilization levels over time. Ron Slaymaker : Okay Chris, thank you. Let\u2019s move to the next caller. Operator : We move next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Ron Slaymaker : Are you there Blayne? Operator, why don\u2019t we move on and if Blayne comes back in maybe we can bring him back up. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura Securities : Yeah. Hi guys. Thanks. So I was just jumping on here a little bit late, but I noticed the guidance for EPS growth is significantly higher than revenue growth. is capacity utilization -- Kevin I know you\u2019re not going to give us gross margin guidance, but is utilization the biggest factor driving the fast earnings growth? Kevin March : I presume that you\u2019re talking in relation to the sequential growth when you\u2019re asking that? Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura Securities : Yeah, in relation to Q1. Kevin March : Yeah. I think you\u2019re going to see -- certainly you get some EPS growth just off the revenue growth itself. You will see some improvement on utilization. As I mentioned a moment ago, we\u2019re increasing the loadings in the factories. But you\u2019ll also see a similar improvement as you go to the next quarter just on lower manufacturing cost. Recall a couple of years ago that we had announced that we were closing two older six inch factories, one in Houston and one in Hiji, Japan and those basically are behind us now. And so that cost saving is finding its way through. So you\u2019ve got a couple moving parts going on inside there. Ron Slaymaker : Do you have a follow on, Romit? Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura Securities : Yeah and can you just talk a little about the impact of OpEx on EPS during the second quarter as well? Thank you. Ron Slaymaker : Romit, I believe that Kevin addressed that earlier and he said basically OpEx should be relatively flat. So instead of repeating that, we\u2019ll move on to the next caller please. Operator : We move to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thanks for letting me ask a question. Ron, a couple of quarters ago there was a lot of talk about seasonality and what that was going to be going forward and I think you chose a three year average for your sequentials in the fourth quarter. As we look forward is that still as good a boggy as any for the June quarter? And from a sequential perspective by my math, that yields about 8% up. You\u2019re guiding above that. What\u2019s better than seasonal in what you guys are seeing? Ron Slaymaker : Ross, I think two months after we gave you that number in fourth quarter, we then started to decline to provide it again. And the reality is seasonality, the number you come up with for call it an average growth for any particularly quarter, will vary so widely based upon the time period that you used to collect that. And so we\u2019ve decided is instead of us giving you our view -- we\u2019ve historically provided \u2013 call it a three year or five average, five year, whatever. The reality is when we threw that number out, it was being perceived as an endorsement of that level of growth for TI and that was never our intentions.  So I think what we\u2019ve decided to do going forward is just let you guys go through that analysis and provide your own estimates on seasonality. If you need help with the math on whether it\u2019s a three year or a five year average, I probably could help on that, but I\u2019m not going to do it for you. The other thing is and I\u2019ve noted even just looking at reports coming into this current report, I think sell-side analysts I saw had anywhere from call it 4% average for second quarter sequential to up to 9% . And again, that just reinforces that the range is so wide that from our perspective internally, we really just don\u2019t put much emphasis on seasonal average given how wide that range is. If you think it\u2019s important, then we\u2019re going to let you go through that on your own.  Do you have a follow on, Ross? Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll be a little more successful with this one. Embedded Processing seemed like that was the segment that provided the upside in the quarter that you just reported. As you think about the microcontroller areas starting to deliver growth given the prior investments that you\u2019ve made, can you give us a little bit of color on some of the applications that are driving that growth? And really why did they start taking off finally now? And maybe looking forward what\u2019s the road map from an end market perspective and application? Anything that can give us a little color in helping us to channel check that segment would be helpful. Ron Slaymaker : I\u2019d offer a couple of things. Microcontrollers; the beauty of microcontrollers is they tend not to -- they are so, so diversified across applications. And so good luck on that channel check, but they\u2019re very much so in industrial applications. Certainly automotive is a factor there. The other piece that I would mention for embedded processing that I already mentioned was communications equipment. Base stations clearly was a lift for TI. The only thing I would caution against is the view that that would draw some significant upside, because the reality is I think for most part analogue and embedded processing came in about as expected. And in fact our revenue overall I think we\u2019re 1% or so above the midpoint of our guidance range. So again the quarter generally came in about as we expected. But what drove the strength there would probably be a mix of industrial, automotive microcontroller applications as well as communications equipment. But pretty much everything was broadly up in the quarter.  I guess that was your follow up, Ross. Thank you and we\u2019ll move to the next caller. Operator : We move to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Guys, can you hear me now? Ron Slaymaker : We can hear you now. Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Hey. Perfect, sorry about that. So I apologize also if you mentioned this earlier, but just on the outlook for June, outside of calculators, were there any outliers in terms of products either up or down in your outlook? Kevin March : Blayne, we don\u2019t specifically break our forecast out into particular end markets or product areas. But I think what I would be safe in saying is that it\u2019s a pretty broad based traction that is taking place in second quarter and it\u2019s driving that growth. That doesn\u2019t mean everything is up uniformly the same but it is -- we believe the strength will be pretty broad based for us. And as you pointed out, calculators probably is the one outlier where it just tends to have a good back to school strength in the second quarter and we do expect that as well this second quarter. Ron Slaymaker : Do you have a follow on, Blayne? Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Yeah. In terms of your restructuring effort that you\u2019ve talked about come, I was just wondering if you\u2019ve taken any other actions now there are product lines. Particularly microcontrollers seems like an area of investment. Have you kind of reallocated any resources there or any color on if there is any other segments that you\u2019ve paired back on spending? Thanks. Kevin March : Blayne, last quarter when we discussed the restructuring efforts that we were taking, we included the discussion of embedded processing in Japan. So Japan is clearly one that is underway. It will be complete for the most part by the end of the second quarter or at the end of second quarter. And that was really to resize our presence in Japan principally from a support standpoint to be more commensurate with the size of the market opportunity there. As it relates to embedded processing, we did discuss that we were in some cases reducing investments or discontinuing on some areas that were no longer showing growth opportunities and other cases reallocating. And that affected our processor side as well as our microcontroller side to a lesser degree in Embedded Processing. Beyond those, there\u2019s no other actions that we\u2019ve taken or intend to take that we\u2019d discuss right now. Ron Slaymaker : Okay. Blayne, thanks for your questions. I\u2019m glad you were able to circle back in and let\u2019s move to the next caller. Operator : We move to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company: Hi, thanks. Can you just talk about from a big picture perspective, can you -- I don\u2019t know if you tried to segment out how much of your revenue is directly related to internet of things. But can you try to give us some sense of the percentage of the revenue that\u2019s related to IOT what with a in a large semi-conductor company actually creating that as is independent segment? Thanks. Ron Slaymaker : Boy Tim, we really don\u2019t and frankly we saw in all the hype that the realm the term internet of things. I think if you look at our capability and market position, it probably is second to none. If you look across processors, microcontrollers that are just inherent in connecting the world. Combine that with our connectivity capability whether Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, those types of capabilities that we have in our embedded business as well. That potential to then go pursue that opportunity of connecting lots of different things, I think is probably second to none. But that being said, as soon as the world goes and puts a big label on it and tries to calculate how much everybody has and this and that, that\u2019s really not what we are interested in. We love the diversity of what you are calling internet of things, meaning if lots of different applications, they have different requirements, they are across different customers, the idea of somehow circling it up into a common end market or whatever we think is probably the wrong approach just because there\u2019s not that much in common there from a technology standpoint or from a customer or an end market standpoint. But again, we\u2019ll just try to stay away from the hype. We\u2019ll keep our heads down and go attack that opportunity.  Do you have a follow on, Tim? Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company : I did actually, yeah. Sorry, I actually jumped on late, but you might have already talked about this, but can you address the channel inventory, either your inventory, and also inventory in the channel and also maybe remind us of what normal seasonal is for Q3? Thanks. Ron Slaymaker : We did hit on some of those things. I\u2019ll say channel inventory for TI we described as less than five and a half weeks, really unchanged from where it\u2019s been for some time now. And I would just say if you look more broadly, we think inventory that we would characterize that as lean. We would characterize customer inventory as lean. Maybe one of the best data points is cancellations from customers are incredibly low right now and we think that reflects a combination of lean inventories as well as the growing demand environment that we are in. But I think both the other pieces there we did address already.  Okay Tim, thanks for your questions. We\u2019ll move to the next caller please. Operator : We move to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs : Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. I\u2019m going to just ask one with no follow ups since a lot of good questions have been asked. You guys had broken out as you usually do your segments at the beginning of the year in terms of end market exposure. I think it was 37% was consumer. Kind of a longer term question, is that a number you are comfortable with or is that a number that you\u2019d like to see decline over time through market share growth in segments? Obviously consumer I don\u2019t think is growing as fast on a revenue basis as some of the other markets over time because of pricing pressure and such there. So just a little perspective on where you would like to see that number three years from now? Thanks a lot. Ron Slaymaker : Okay. Thanks Jim, and that\u2019s a good question. So let me do a couple of things. I\u2019ll also give a little bit of the color of what happened in quarter by end market because nobody has asked that question. But very clearly we do talk about the one end market being personal electronics and in 2013 that was 37% of our revenue. That is not what you would historically or typically think of as consumer though. It does have products like gaming products in there. It has television in there, set top box, but it also includes mobile phones, notebook computers, printers and also things like tablets. And so it will go down between 2013 and 2014 largely because of our exit from legacy wireless.  So, most of that revenue would have been shipping into the personal electronics space. But again don\u2019t -- and I\u2019ve had a number of questions from analysts over the last few months that imply that a people think of personal electronics as consumer. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s again mobile phones, notebooks and that space as well. They do tend to be consumer buying decisions as opposed to enterprise, but they are not what you\u2019ve typically thought of in past as consumer electronic. So I think in the prepared remarks we gave a top level overview of what drove revenue from a year ago. Maybe I can give a little more granularity on that. So I think we talked about communications equipment being the highest contributor of growth from a year ago.  That very clearly tied to wireless infrastructure. Next we said industrial. Interestingly industrial, if you go out to our website, we break that down into multiple sectors, something like 12, 15 different sectors below the industrial level. Pretty much all of them were up in that year-on-year comparison, with most of them up at a double digit growth level, so good strength and broad strength in industrial. Automotive, similarly. If you go look at the sectors on our website, all of them were up. Infotainment products were the strongest, but all of the sectors inside automotive were up.  Enterprise Systems we said were about even for TI and that really is a combination of growth in projector revenue, which again is primarily DLP for TI, offset by declines in servers and then the last area which we started off with on personal electronics. It was down, but it was down pretty much only due to legacy wireless. If you would have excluded the legacy wireless revenue out of that comparison, then personal electronics would have been about even from a year ago. So again that\u2019s just a little more color of what happened inside there. Jim, thank you for your questions and let\u2019s move to the next caller. Operator : We move to Vivek Arya with Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - Banc of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you for taking my question. When I look at your first half growth in Analog and Embedded, I think it\u2019s almost 13%, 14% year-on-year. Very strong, well above what we\u2019ve seen from most of the peer group so far. Are you worried at all about double ordering anything that suggests that trends could sail off in the second half? Do you have enough visibility in the second half, whether it will be roughly seasonal? Not anything that suggests that the trends are sustainable versus not. Ron Slaymaker : I\u2019ll make up a comment and Kevin if you have anything to add certainly jumps in. Vivek, we\u2019re not seeing at this point signs of that kind of overheated market. Typically that comes along with crazy expedites and things like that that frankly we just didn\u2019t see in the quarter. We saw customers giving us good visibility into their needs. We\u2019ve been shipping at the lead times that we\u2019ve been quoting them and our lead times have been stable. In that environment typically, there\u2019s no need for customers to start that double ordering process that you mentioned. So again we really see no signs of that taking place. In terms of visibility in the second half, again we\u2019ve got customers for the most part trying to give us visibility into their needs. But I would really not say we have -- I would not want to try to provide any specific comments about second half visibility at this point. Kevin, do you have any other comment? Kevin March : Not much different than what you\u2019re saying. I would looking over the numbers here go back to your point. We did have 13% year over year growth in the first quarter when you combine Analog and Embedded processing. That\u2019s up just a bit from last quarter when it was 12% year-over-year and up a little bit from the prior quarter when it was up to 7% year-over-year. What we\u2019re actually seeing is a slight acceleration in that to it looks like the low teens. And that\u2019s probably consistent with what we talked about at the last earnings release. We said that we felt 2014 was shaping up to be a better year than 2013. And I think this is just reinforcing that.  And the big difference that we see is that in 2014 it appears in the U.S economy is attempting to grow at a faster pace than it has in the last few years. In 2014 for the first time in a number of years, you\u2019re seeing Europe beginning to grow rather than shrink. You continue to see growth broadly across Asia, albeit at a slightly lower rate, still growing quite strongly. I think what we\u2019re really seeing here is the result of an improving, broader economy and our efforts of trying to gain market share inside those spaces combined our results and the nice growth for TI. And as Ron said for the second half, we\u2019ll give you that forecast, at least the first part of that forecast in about 90 days. Ron Slaymaker : Vivek, maybe the other thing that I would just add real quick is, you see our inventory numbers. We have good, healthy inventory. It\u2019s not getting drawn down. And again customers were worried about supply from Texas Instruments, you would see probably some impact on those type metrics and yet we don\u2019t right now. Do you have a follow on to that? Vivek Arya - Banc of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thanks for answering that first question. You guys are the largest player in this space. That\u2019s really encouraging to see the kind of trends that you\u2019re reporting. As my follow up question just probably more a math question, but at what revenue level would underutilization charges be behind you? Or asked in a different way, if you\u2019re saying you have installed capacity of $18 billion and your current sales are about, I don\u2019t know say $13 billion, will we continue to see underutilization charges until you use all of your installed capacity? Or how should we think about that underutilization charge number that you report every quarter in relation to the amount of installed capacity that you have and then obviously the implications on how we should model your gross margins going forward? Kevin March : Yeah. Vivek, I would suggest you think about it the way we do and the way most of our investors that we speak with seem to think about it, and that is not what is the underutilization capacity of the current period gross profit margin or next period gross profit margin, but what\u2019s the total free cash flow that we can generate with that available capacity and what\u2019s the cheapest way to bring that capacity in house so that we can maximize cash flow going forward? And that\u2019s exactly how we think about it. So frankly we do no focus on trying to figure out how to get the utilization charge down to zero. In fact by definition, with our stated strategy of buying capacity opportunistically when we don\u2019t need it, when prices are relatively low, that by definition means that we will always have open capacity and therefore we\u2019ll always be underutilized in a classic sense. But from a cash flow standpoint, when we do the math and the trade off on that and the last few years are certainly proving that out, we generate a heck of a lot more cash flow with that kind of behavior than we would if we focused purely on maximizing utilization which puts us at the risk of buying capacity at two expensive of a price. So that\u2019s the way we look at it. And I\u2019d offer that you maybe think about it on the longer term view like that as opposed to trying to model in near term GPM percent swings and utilization swings. Ron Slaymaker : Okay Vivek, thank you for your questions. Let\u2019s move to the next caller. Operator : We move to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein Stacy Rasgon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I apologize if this has been covered. I hopped on a little late, but when I\u2019m looking at your guidance for next quarter and I\u2019m backing into sort of the implications for gross margin, I\u2019m getting something that\u2019s reasonably close to 57%. It\u2019s almost 300 basis points increase. I think you\u2019d mentioned higher revenue. I think you\u2019d also talked about the six inch fab closures. My understanding was the fab closures that were already in the numbers. Is this something that happens like as a lump improvement this quarter or any color you can give us on I guess the relative impact of drivers revenue, cost saving and mix would be very helpful. And I guess just some indication of whether that 57% number is something that you guys are actually are thinking for next quarter? Kevin March : Yes. Stacy, on the margins clearly they are going to be up and they are going to be up quite a bit and it\u2019s not dissimilar to what you saw a year ago. If you go to a year ago and take a look you would have seen our gross margins from 1Q to 2Q increased in a similar manner. And in part that\u2019s just a natural effect of stepping up manufacturing production for a typically stronger second quarter versus one quarter. So if you take a look today on a year over year basis, the best way to think about it is that we continue to have improved product mix. A year ago we still had wireless. Now we have virtually none. So it\u2019s mostly analog and embedded processing.  We have lower manufacturing costs versus a year ago and again this is the Houston and Hiji factories now completely out of the mix. And to a lesser extent we have some lower utilization charges because in fact we are expecting revenue levels this quarter, this 2Q to be higher than they were 2Q a year ago. And so that will take on a little bit more of our capacity. So there\u2019s a combination of things going on there. And the bottom line is that when you do the math, your gross margins are going to be stepping up rather nicely as you just suggested. Stacy Rasgon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein : Got it. And I guess to follow up on that same trend. Presumably you\u2019ll continue to have higher revenues year over year than you had last year. And you are sitting now, I would think it\u2019s close to 600 basis points higher than you were last year. Does this mean that you could actually maybe even have visibility into the ballpark of 60% exiting the year and going into 2015? Is that something that you guys -- I don\u2019t know if you guys think internally about gross margin targets anymore, but that\u2019s something that \u2013 is this something that could actually be plausible at this point? Kevin March : Stacey I would say that a lot of numbers are plausible. We don\u2019t really spend time thinking or looking at it in that context. We spend again more time thinking in context of are we taking steps that are going to maximize our free cash flow on a continuous basis. And in doing that then GPM just tends to fall out. So from that standpoint there\u2019s nothing structural that stops us from getting higher GPMs as we move forward. In fact if we continue to be successful as we have been in increasing our analog and embedded processing mix, at the same time of keeping very low cost manufacturing underneath that mix, then clearly our margins not only are benefiting as you are computing now, but will continue to benefit as we look into the future. Ron Slaymaker : Okay Stacy, thanks for your questions and operator I think we have time for one final caller. Operator : We\u2019ll move to Tore Svanberg with Stifel Nicolaus. Eric Rasmus \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Hi, it\u2019s Eric [Rasmus] calling in for Tore. I appreciate you just getting me in here. I know a lot has been talked about the restructuring, but maybe just can you talk about the progress on the Embedded Processing business in boosting those operating margins there? I know last quarter looked like just some out performance and the margins were up. But is there a target that you\u2019re shooting for internally? Is there something that you can maybe tell us for your end and maybe help us measure the progress there? Kevin March : Eric, I think the way to think about the Embedded Processing is that again we\u2019ve been seeing some nice growth in that business. I think if I recall six quarters of year over year growth going on in that business. So we\u2019re beginning to see the payoff of prior investments resulting in real revenue growth. That growth is in the right areas. It\u2019s where we can -- we\u2019ve got sustainable product revenue streams and very attractive margins. Consequently we\u2019re seeing profit margins beginning to improve rather nicely and that\u2019s even before we see the benefit of the restructuring actions that we talked about for Embedded Processing.  That\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re done. There\u2019s still quite a bit more work to be done, but most importantly with that business is focusing on is growing into its inherent cost base. And so more growth is what\u2019s going to be really important there. And clearly at its current operating profit levels, it\u2019s not anywhere near where we think it can take us to. I won\u2019t go beyond that on forecasting what margins might be, but I think you know from how we operate the business here we\u2019re focused on free cash flow, which means you\u2019ve got to have some right margins in there. And this business still has quite a bit of work to do to get to where we expect entitlement is. Ron Slaymaker : Do you have a follow on, Eric? Eric Erasmus : Okay, great. Thanks for that. Yeah, CapEx maybe. Where do you see your investments being focused? How do you plan on allocating your CapEx I guess over the next 12 months? Thank you. Kevin March : Eric, we did announce that with the 4Q earnings released that we had just acquired an assembly tests site in Chengdu, China. We\u2019ll be spending money on that in 2014 bringing that building up to our standards and bringing the production line up and ready for output in the second half or late this year. So the majority of our CapEx will tend to go toward our assembly and test operations given that we already have significant capacity in our wafer fab operations. Ron Slaymaker : Okay, great. Eric, thanks for your questions and we\u2019re going to wrap it at this point. Thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : This concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Please stand by. Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir. Ron Slaymaker : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin Marks, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. In addition, Dave Pahl has joined us. As many of you know, I will retire in August and Dave will replace me as Head of Investor Relations. Dave has worked at TI for 25 years and has worked directly with me Investor Relations for 10 years. With that consideration, you probably should allow him some time to come up to speed. Dave has also been recently elected by TI's Board to the position of Company Vice President. Dave will moderate today's call. With that, let me turn it over to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Ron. It's good to join you today for the call. And now down to business. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and any relevant non-GAAP reconciliation on our website at TI.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and could be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for more complete description. The second quarter was another solid quarter. Our core businesses of analog and embedded processing grew strongly with combined revenue up 14% from a year ago. We continue to benefit from our investments in industrial and automotive as these important markets continue to grow as a percentage of our revenue. Revenue of $3.29 billion came in slightly higher than the middle of the expected range we communicated to you in April. Earnings per share of $0.62 were near the top of our expected range as profitability was stronger in the quarter. Free cash flow of $3.2 billion or 25% of revenue for the trailing 12-month period was right in line with the 20% to 30% range in which we expect to operate over time. Also over the past 12 months we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. As a reminder, our model for cash returns to shareholders is to return all of our free cash flow less the net debt amount that is retired, plus any proceeds we received from exercises of equity compensation. This model demonstrates our confidence in TI'x business and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago, with double-digit growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by power management. High-performance analog, high-volume analog and logic and Silicon Valley analog also grew. Embedded processing revenue grew 14% from a year ago, primarily due to processors and micro-controllers, both of which grew about the same amount. Connectivity grew at a faster rate, although it was coming from a much smaller base. Embedded processing delivered its seventh quarter in a row of year-over-year growth as our investments over the past few years in strategic areas are yielding favorable results. In our other segment, revenue declined $90 million or 13% from a year ago due to legacy wireless which is essentially gone. Turning to distribution, resales increased 15% from a year ago while distributors' inventories were about even. Weeks of inventories fell by several days to just over 4-1/2 weeks. This reduction was driven by a higher percentage of resales being supported by TI's consignment inventory programs. From an end-market perspective, most growth from the year-ago came in communications equipment, followed by automotive and industrial. Enterprise Systems was also up while revenue in personal electronics declined due to mobile phones and tablets, areas that use legacy wireless products from TI. Now, Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Kevin March : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.88 billion or 57.1% of revenue. Gross profit increased 20% from the year-ago quarter and gross margin hit another new record. When compared with the previous record in the third quarter of 2013, revenue was $48 million higher and gross profit was $102 million. This reflects an improved product portfolio focus on analog and embedded processing, as well as increased efficiency in our manufacturing operations. Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $821 million was down $39 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the reductions in legacy wireless as well as continued cost discipline across TI. Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, a non-cash expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $4 million benefit. As a reminder, the year-ago quarter included a gain of $315 million associated with the transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer. Operating profit was $982 million or 29.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $683 million or $0.62 per share. Let me comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations were $775 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 111, consistent with our model of 105 million to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $80 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 months basis, cash flow from operations was $3.59 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $388 million or 3% of revenue, even lower than our long-term expectation of 4%. Although we've been able to keep capital expenditures at this low level, we continue to invest to expand both our capabilities and our capacity. As examples, capital expenditures in the second quarter included the cost to prepare the site and install the first tools into our new assembly and test facility in Chengdu, China. We completed manufacturing our first units there for qualification purposes. In addition, we brought on additional tools to expand capacity in our 300 millimeter facility in Richardson, Texas. We were able to make these investments and keep our capital spending at low levels because of our strategy to invest in capacity opportunistically and ahead of demand. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.20 billion or 25% of revenue, in the middle of our expected 20% to 30% range. Free cash flow was 10% higher than a year ago. Depreciation expense for the past 12 months was $856 million. Depreciation exceeded our capital expenditures by $468 million or 3.7% of revenue. We continue to expect the whole capital spending at low levels or at about 4% of revenue. As a result, the depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending and our gross margins will directly benefit. As we said, we believe strong cash flow growth, particularly free cash flow growth, is most important to maximize shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. To that end, in the second quarter, TI paid $323 million in dividends and repurchased $743 million of our stock for a total return of $1.07 billion. The shareholder return part of our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow minus debt retirement plus any proceeds that we receive from exercises of equity compensation. Total cash return in the past 12 months was $4.2 billion, which was 18% higher than a year ago. Dividends were up 32% and stock repurchases were up 13%. Fundamental to our cash return strategy are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $2.80 billion of cash and short-term investments, down from $4.03 billion at the beginning of the quarter. The decline mostly reflects the use of $1 billion to retire debt in the quarter. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.33 billion, up 7% from a year ago, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.01, which would have been higher but was impacted by the conversion of consignment of some products that are sold through distribution. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.31 billion to $3.59 billion in the third quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 6% from the year ago. If you exclude the $57 million of legacy wireless revenue from the year-ago quarter, revenue would increase 8%. We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.76. Restructuring charges will continue to be essentially nil. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at this level for the next five years. Our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 remains about 28%. This is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter. In summary, the second quarter demonstrates the strength of TI's business model, focused on analog and embedded processing which we believe are the best opportunities inside of the semiconductor market. We continue to invest in areas that offer sustainable growth, solid profitability and good cash flow from operations. The percentage of our business from industrial and automotive markets continues to grow as customers increasingly embrace technology that makes end-products smarter and more connected. At the same time, we continue to invest in our manufacturing capabilities, and our strategy to opportunistically acquire manufacturing assets means that we can deliver strong free cash flows. We continue to demonstrate, as we did again in the second quarter, our commitment to provide strong returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions -- Operator : Thank you. Dave Pahl : -- in order to provide as many people as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Go ahead, Renee [ph]. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll now take the first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse : Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Kevin, I guess my first question is on OpEx. I think for the June quarter, going into June, you kind of guided OpEx would be flattish Q-on-Q, and you did better than that. I'm kind of curious, is that a pull-in of the $130 million of annualized savings you expected from the restructuring or is that just a bigger number than 130? And how do we think about OpEx trending in September, in the back half of the year? Kevin March : Yeah, John, you're right, the OpEx we had expected to be roughly even from first quarter and the second quarter, and that came in a bit lower than we had expected. And part of that was some pull-in with the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter for both embedded processing and resizing of our operation in Japan, and part of it was just continued discipline on the part of all the business units in TI when it came to spending. As you look into 3Q, we continue to expect the second half to be the primary benefit of the cost savings that we talked about for those restructuring action. Recall [ph] that we expect about $130 million of annualized savings, with about 85% of that in OpEx and the balance in cost of revenue. So as we go into third quarter, we'll see probably about half of that amount come in to our results in OpEx, with the balance in fourth quarter. So by the time we leave the year, we should be at an annualized $130 million cost savings from that action. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-up, John? John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse : Yeah, that's helpful, Kevin. As a follow-up, I know this is somewhat of an unfair question, but if you look at the proceeds from equity compensation. Last year it was almost about a third of the cash returns to investors. I know that's been a volatile number and probably a number that's impossible to predict. But I'm kind of curious, how should you think we should think about that number going forward from here? How do we try to model that number in the future? Kevin March : John, we talked in -- during the update to our capital management strategy that going forward we would expect the proceeds from stock option exercises to reduce considerably. We saw, gosh, I think it was probably two to three times our normal rate stock option exercises and cash proceeds, in 2013 than we'd seen in prior years. So we'd talked about that going forward that would probably come back down to a more normalized level. And I would suspect that, you know, what we saw last quarter, what we saw this quarter, probably is more reflective of what you should model going forward, figure about, you know, I think we saw about 4% or 5% of stock options exercised last year, and that'll probably drop back down to 1.5%, 2% kind of level. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, John. Next caller please? Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Great guys. Thanks so much for taking the question, I appreciate it. You know, could you just give us some perspective on kind of the broader cyclical environment? Would you say there's anything at all going on other than normal, and maybe break that down by sub-category a little bit? And I'll leave that as both questions and pass from there. Thanks. Dave Pahl : Okay, Jim. I think that, you know, we don't have any unique insight into what's going on from a cyclical standpoint. I think that the quarter that we just delivered, you know, we feel good about. If you look at the middle of our range into third quarter, 8% if you're excluding legacy wireless, is another good quarter on a year-on-year basis. If you look at a lot of the signals that one would pay attention to, such as inventory inside of the channel, we took several days out of inventory in the quarter as we had a higher percentage of revenue supported by our consignment programs inside of distribution. And if you look at cancellations, they continue to remain at very, very low levels. We think inventory at customers remains in check as well. So -- and then if you look at our lead times, they continue to remain stable. We'll always have some pockets where they may move out temporarily. But with our capacity and the position of our inventory, we feel really good to be able to continue to support that. So you have a follow-up question? Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs : The sub, the verticals, any differences by vertical? Dave Pahl : No. I think that from a year-on-year standpoint we had, if you look at industrial, we had growth in nearly all the sectors, so, very broad-based from that standpoint, led by areas like factory automation. Automotive we had double-digit growth, and all of our sectors led by ADAS or Advanced Driver Systems. Personal electronics was down, but it would have been up had it not been for legacy wireless. Our enterprise systems we saw growth, driven by projectors and servers. And coms equipment was up due to wireless infrastructure. So, really broad-based growth on that stand. Okay, thanks. We'll go to the next caller. Operator : Thank you. We'll take Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Stacy Rasgon \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I want to dig in to your, I guess, your margin trajectory. Your incremental operating margins for analog and embedded processing both exceeded 100% sequentially in the quarter. Your analog business also has about 100% incremental operating margins year over year. I guess the strong performance, particularly in analog, surprises me a little bit. I thought most of the cut you did were in embedded processing. So I wonder if you could give us some sort of view on what's driving that strong incremental margin, how much of that is sort of gross margin expansion within the businesses versus OpEx. And what do you sort of see as sort of sustainable levels of incremental operating margin going forward as the revenues in the businesses continue to grow? Kevin March : Yes, Stacy, the fall-through was very good both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, certainly at the company level and at the segment levels. The -- I'd mentioned I guess on the first call from John that, from an OpEx standpoint, spending remains disciplined across the company. So while the restructuring action that you referred to will disproportionately benefit embedded processing versus other areas of the company, some of that will also -- some of that restructuring will benefit other areas of the company as well. For example, we mentioned resizing our sales team in Japan. And that, not just the sales team in support of embedded processing but also those in support of some of the other business units. So you get a little bit of benefit there. But then really you got just disciplined spending across the company, as frankly people are spending only what they need to support the growth of the business. On a go-forward basis, again we expect OpEx to be down a little bit sequentially, primarily for the benefit of embedded processing. That'll be true for both the third and fourth quarter. Beyond that, I don't know if that gives you any more specific forecast on OpEx other than, by the time we reach the end of the year, we will enter next year with OpEx about, total cost savings from the restructuring, about $130 million, about 85% of that coming off OpEx. Stacy Rasgon \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Got it. That's helpful. Yeah. For my follow-on, I want to dig in to gross margin just a little bit. So if I take that, you know, half of the $130 million kind of hitting you or 85% hitting you by next quarter, it sounds to me like you're guiding OpEx down about 2%, which would give me an implied gross margin guidance at the corporate level, call it into the upper 57%, so, you know, up maybe 500 basis points, maybe a little more, off from Q2. So can you give us just some view of what's driving that gross margin expansion? Is this just further efficiencies, manufacturing efficiencies, is this just depreciation coming down? Is this something also to do with mix or pricing, or just overall revenue leverage as revenues grow? Kevin March : You know, I think it's a little bit of all of that, to be quite frank, Stacy. The -- if you take a look at, as we go forward on gross margin, you know, there's multiple drivers inside the portfolio, not the least of which is being able to load or fill up our very cost-effective factories. We also get improved product mix, especially as we see industrial and automotive becoming a larger portion of our total revenue mix. And finally, we get the benefit from depreciation as it begins to roll off, being that the CapEx is running substantially below depreciation now for quite some time. Again just to remind, the depreciation was about 7% of revenue over the last 12 months and CapEx is expected to around 4%. So, you know, we get some closure that will start happening over the next couple of years. Depreciation this year is expected to be down a bit versus last year, but it'll start to climb more rapidly next year. So you got a number of different things going on, not just next quarter, that will move gross margins up again, as you indicated, but should also continue to benefit us as we look out into the balance of the year and going into 2015. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Stacy. Operator, we can go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Blayne Curtis with Barclays next. Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Wondering what utilization was in the quarter and where you expect that to go. And then the second part of my question, as you look into December, typically seasonally softer period, things seem fairly normal. I was wondering your thoughts on just seasonality into December. Kevin March : I'll mention -- I'll talk to utilization and Dave will talk to seasonality there. But, you know, Blayne, we look at utilization 2Q to 3Q, we don't expect that to really change all that much, as we, you know, have our wafer starts not too far off from what we saw in the first quarter and what we -- excuse me, the second quarter, and what we saw in the second quarter will come out of the factory in the third quarter. So overall utilization, unlikely to change all that much as we look into the near term. Dave Pahl : And from a seasonality standpoint, Blayne, essentially we're going to let you determine what you believe seasonality is. And just a few things to consider as you go through that, obviously calculator revenue is usually strongest in second quarter and third quarter with the back-to-school buying period, and you saw that in our results this quarter. And our semiconductor growth is typically relatively stronger in the second and third quarters compared with the first and fourth. So, outside of that, we don't put much credence on a specific sequential growth number just because the numbers around that have been so unpredictable, and we're just going to step back from trying to provide any appearance of doing that on it, because it'll appear that we're endorsing one number over another, so. You have a follow-on, Blayne? Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays: Just wondering, maybe in the September quarter, a similar question, whether outside of calculators there's any areas of particular strength or weakness. You had mentioned com had been a strong point. Is that sustaining? And then it seems like autos as well have held in there better, usually seasonally weaker second half, but seems strong. Any comments there? Dave Pahl : Sure, yeah. Other than the top-line [[ph] guidance, we don't really get into strength or weakness by sector. If there's something very unusual going on, like with our legacy wireless, of course we've given visibility into those types of things in the past. So with that, we'll move to the next caller. Operator : Thank you. We'll move to Doug Friedman with RBC Capital Markets. Doug Friedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. And before I begin my question, Ron, it's been great working with you, and best of luck in retirement, before forgetting to say that. So going into the numbers, if you could talk a little bit maybe about your strategy to maybe increase free cash flow. When we look at sort of what's going on with your balance sheet, you're getting pretty close to getting a debt level that might be good to carry that debt and stop retiring it or maybe just start rolling it forward. Can you maybe talk a little bit, Kevin, about your strategy there? Kevin March : Well, the strategy is less about debt and more about the actual product portfolio and the markets we're going after, Doug. It's really about being sure that we're thoughtful on how we spend our research and development dollars, and we spend them on products that we expect to have very long revenue life streams off of them. And then in correlation with that is to continue to be opportunistic and to expand our manufacturing capacity at times when you may least expect us to do that, because we can get it for costs that are very low. Those are our two biggest levers for expanding cash flow. As it relates to debt going forward, as you observed, we just paid off in debt of $500 million this year. We raised $500 million in the first quarter and repaid $1 billion in the second quarter, so a net reduction of $500 million. We still have on the balance sheet total debt of about $4.625 billion, and those actually have lives that extend all the way out to 2023. So I don't see balance vanishing from -- debt vanishing from our balance sheet anytime soon. On a go-forward basis, of course our buyback, I think that was one of the things you were asking about on the free cash flow, is really a function of what our calculation of net present value of the company is. And so long as we see that the intrinsic value of the company exceeds the market value, we'll continue to be buyers of the stock. Doug Friedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And -- Dave Pahl : Doug, you have a follow-up? Doug Friedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Yeah. What role will M&A possibly play, and when do you think is there an opportunity to reenter the M&A markets? You guys really have not been active since the National Semi deal has closed. Kevin March : You know, when it comes to M&A, again it's about product strategy. Our bias is likely to be to find an opportunity that would be attractive to us. Our bias would probably be in the analog space as opposed to embedded processing. And frankly, aside from the technology that we acquire and the product opportunity that we acquire, being attractive, meaning long revenue streams, it would also have to work for us mathematically, meaning that the price at which we could acquire it would have to be such that we could get a return on our invested capital inside of three to four-year period. And we're pretty disciplined about that. Some of the opportunities that some have speculated on here in recent months are such, if we do the math, it's very difficult to overcome that hurdle of making sure its ROIs be accretive. And we think that's very important if we're going to actually generate excess cash flow and free cash flow off of any acquisition in the future. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Doug. Operator, next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk around the strengths that you alluded to in communications equipment in Q2. Is that macro base stations or is there some other element of that? Dave Pahl : Yeah. The majority of that is -- would be macro base stations. If you look at investments that we're making longer term, that will include small cell, but we really don't have measurable revenue on products like that at this point. Joe Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay, thanks. And as part of the embedded restructuring that you had done, it sounded you were pulling back on some of the investing in that category. Does that your trajectory at all or does that mean you'll participate less in base stations over time? Dave Pahl : No. I think if you look at those investments and those product cycles, they tend to have -- they tend to be very long in nature. So the areas that we've pulled back tend to be areas that we now believe are either mature or in the process of maturing, and yet we continue to invest in areas that will drive growth in the future as much as small cells, as I indicated before, so. Thank you, Joe. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We'll move to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Hi, thank you. A question on CapEx, Kevin. Your capital intensity has been fairly below the 4% that you had said that you would be. What should we be modeling for the remainder of the year? And more importantly, what would cause it to move and check [ph] upwards? Kevin March : Yeah, Ambrish, you know, again I think for purposes of your models, I would just assume about a 4% of revenue kind of planning. It's going to get you pretty close to probably the right answer over time. In any one quarter I'm sure it's going to be off, but it will be okay for -- on a rough annual period. Anything that might cause us to go above that could possibly be if we had a sudden opportunity present itself, we could add capacity at a significant cost savings. We wouldn't let than 4% artificially restrain us from taking advantage of very inexpensive manufacturing capacity which would benefit our future free cash flow. But right now I don't see that on the horizon, so again for your model I'd probably just use 4%. Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay. And my quick follow-up, Dave, you mentioned that consignment as a percent of sales has changed. What has it gone back up? And I think I remember it used to be in the mid-40s before? Dave Pahl : Yeah. If you look overall, our consignment as a percent of revenue has moved up a little bit from about 45% to about 50%. If you look inside of our distribution channel, so about 55% of our revenues are -- go through distribution and about 55% of those revenues are supported by consignment. So that's really the part that's beginning to drive that higher and our inventories that's owned by distributors lower. So, thanks, Ambrish, and we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital Markets. Christopher Rolland \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : Hey guys. So your extra capacity, you know, at the bottom of the cycle may have been a bit of a burden but can be very valuable as the cycle heats up here. So do you think we're at the point in the cycle where you guys are benefiting from that extra capacity either front-end or backend? Do you think that some of your competitors might have a lack of capacity there, might be switching to your products? Kevin March : Christopher, clearly we've had this strategy in place now for a number of years where we're acquiring as inexpensively as we can manage to in advance of our needs. The most recent example was the acquisition of an assembly test operation in Chengdu, China that I commented on in the call that we're now bringing online. And so that has certainly been a benefit to us, to allow us to have very stable lead times on behalf of our customers, and to be able to meet any short-term spikes or inside lead time requests that customers had had. You know, broadly speaking, across the industry, it does break [ph] us that many people perhaps have chosen not to invest in as much capacity as they might have in the past. It's unclear to us just what that may mean going forward. But at least from our standpoint for our customers, they can have confidence that we have ample capacity to meet their need. Dave Pahl : Yeah, and Chris, I'll add also, you know, we've taken other actions that utilize that capacity different points of demand. And so one thing that we've done, and you can see it on the balance sheet, is that in periods of weaker demand we'll actually build finished good inventory as well as aging wafers to support future demand on low-volume products. And so it may take 20 minutes, 30 minutes to set up a piece of assembly test equipment, and you may run only 10,000 units on that part, and it may take up a half-hour or an hour. It doesn't take much longer to build either, you know, six months of demand or a full year of demand or a year-and-a-half of demand, and put that on the shelves. So when demand actually gets stronger, we've got the capacity open and available to support that stronger demand. So we feel good to be able to support really any demand environment that we see in the future. You have a follow-on, Chris? Christopher Rolland \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : Sure. The other segment, it was above the Street, also above seasonality. Is that just calculators or is there something else there? Kevin March : Yeah, that's really just calculators, just seasonally strong in the second and third quarter for the back-to-school selling season, and then is typically weaker in the fourth and first quarter as kids are already in school and have their calculators. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Chris. Now we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take the next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America : Thanks for taking my question. And good luck to both Dave and to Ron. For my first question, I'm curious, what are under-utilization charges running at right now? And at what level of utilization can they go to zero? Kevin March : Yeah, Vivek, they were about $56 million last quarter, down from the prior quarter which was about $105 million. And that's a bit of a theoretical question as to, you know, what revenue it would take to get to zero. Clearly the mix of products flowing across the various manufacturing flows are going to have a direct bearing on that. So if we had much higher demand but it was on a flow where we didn't have a lot of excess capacity, it wouldn't help much on the under-utilization. So our job on that is to make sure that all of our flows maintain open capacity. And I'll remind everybody again that the under-utilization, we don't let that distract us. It's an accounting adjustment that affects -- nothing happens to free cash flow. We are completely focused on free cash flow as the way to return value to our shareholders. Dave Pahl : Yeah. And Vivek, I'll also mention that that charge is -- less than half of it is actual cash, so -- or about half of it is non-cash. So, really doesn't impact our free cash flow by having that open capacity. Do you have a follow-up? Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America : Yeah. So I guess that means open capacity you have is more source of keeping CapEx low and free cash flow rather than being a big source of expanding gross margins. But maybe on to my second question, on the demand environment, can you give us a sense, I think you mentioned end-markets, but what about the geographies, are there certain geos that are better or worse than what you thought two months ago? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Okay. So let me follow up on the last one, just to make a clarifying point. So as Kevin talked about, there are certain factories that, you know, and you've seen some competitors, some of the manufacturers in Taiwan run above 100% capacity. So, you know, when we've got factories or flows that run above 100% or above the theoretical level that we've got from utilization standpoint, we'll continue to get a benefit, and we still may have an under-utilization charge. So, don't think that that -- all you have left is revenue growth, that small number that's an under-utilization charge. So, just wanted to make that clear. So from a regional standpoint, year over year, Vivek, we saw Asia, Europe and Japan were up. The U.S. was -- it was roughly even from a year-ago standpoint. So with that, we'll get to the next caller. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from CJ Muse with ISI Group. CJ Muse \u2013 ISI Group : Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, once OpEx normalizes in calendar '2014, how should we think about growth in OpEx relative to top line into 2015 and beyond? Kevin March : Well, CJ, that's a long way planning you're doing there for a semiconductor analyst. You know, from an OpEx standpoint, I think that it will probably grow at least with the change in paying benefits that you'd expect on a year-over-year basis, so you'd certainly start there. And then to the extent that we see additional opportunities that we may want to invest in from an R&D standpoint or additional sales opportunities we may want to expand, it may go a bit beyond that. But typically you're going to see -- I think last year, paying benefits increased, average, around 3%, maybe 4%, depending upon the average from around the world. So that's what I'd probably use for planning. CJ Muse \u2013 ISI Group : Okay, helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, question on the cycle. It looks like your guide for Q3 year over year is slowing a bit, and would love to hear your thoughts on where we are here. Will we -- rebuilding inventory downstream and now we're normalizing and now attracting more with GDP and/or, you know, are there any signs of re-acceleration in GDP or in demand in any point geographically or product life, et cetera? Dave Pahl : Yes. CJ, I think, you know, on that front, we really don't spend a lot of time looking at the cycle, and our strongest indicator demand of course is the view that we get from orders and the forecast that we get from our consignment customers as they'll give us forecast. This forecast of course can change. And, you know, we just turned in a good growth year on year. If you look at the year-on-year growth, that's 6%, 8% without legacy wireless, continues to be -- continues to be strong, at the midpoint of the guidance range, yes. And so, you know, that's what -- that we believe all those indicators are showing us. As I talked about before, things like, you know, we're building demand in the channel or downstream, it actually took inventory out of the channel as more of our distributors moved to consignment, and as the products that were on consignment actually grew faster than the other products. So we really, you know, for a little over four-and-a-half weeks of inventory that's in the channel, we consider that to be lean, but probably will be running in what is the more of a new normal range. So those changes in inventory downstream because of the consignments that we've got are going to have less of an impact on our revenues as what they've had in the past. So with that, we can go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We'll move to David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo : Thank you very much. Could you give us some idea of how your policy of returning the bulk of your cash to shareholders affects future acquisition policy? Do you have expectation, your acquisition activity will be relatively low or that you'll be working primarily in stock purchases? Kevin March : Yeah. David, I think the way to think about it, it relates - it kind of goes back a bit to a question that was asked earlier about, I believe by Doug, on debt on the balance sheet, from an acquisition standpoint, again, we'll look at first the strategic bit, make sure it makes sense, and then second, to make sure the numbers actually work on the return on the invested capital that we put into it. Beyond that, the way we'd pay for it is probably very similar to what we did this last time, when we bought National Semiconductor, we used some cash on hand but we actually released the strength of the balance sheet and went out to the bond market and issued quite a bit of debt which supported that acquisition. As we slowly retire debt as we had been and continue to over the next foreseeable future, that just opens the balance sheet back up and makes it available again to take on debt if there's an attractive ROIC accretive acquisition out there. So that's where I would -- that's how I would think about the strategy going forward. I don't see any of our cash management strategy having any interference whatsoever with our ability to continue to acquire when it makes sense. David Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from William Stein with Suntrust. William Stein \u2013 Suntrust Humphrey Robinson : Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the good quarter and guide. I'm hoping you might comment on the margin progression in the embedded segment. It seems to -- progressed a bit better and it looks to us as though perhaps the restructuring benefits that you're targeting are coming in a bit earlier than you previously expected. Kevin March : Yeah. You're exactly right on that. They have started to come in a bit earlier than we planned, but we still have a long way to go. We will see additional benefit as we move in the second and third quarter, as we talked about -- excuse me, third and fourth quarters as we talked about earlier, as we see more of the costs begin to come out of there. But frankly while that's certainly helpful in moving the profit performance of that segment forward, it is not going to be done when that's over with. There's a lot more work to be done there, and work is really on the revenue growth side. The operating profit clearly is below what we think the potential for that segment is, and that management team is very focused on driving results to get that profit up to where it should be. And really after the restructuring actions are complete by the end of this year, it's really going to be all about revenue growth. It actually has been a lot about revenue growth as evidenced by the fact that that business has successfully grown for seven quarters in a row on a year-over-year basis, and we expect to see more of that as we go forward. So that business can grow its way into cost structure [indiscernible] -- William Stein \u2013 Suntrust Humphrey Robinson : That's helpful. If I can follow up just a bit in that. I think there's one area of that business where you're kind of under-hitting relative to your weight in the industry, and that's micro-controllers. I know that you've invested in this area in the last year or two. I'm wondering if you can talk about, you know, the strategy in terms of products, end-markets, features that might lead to accelerating share gain in that category. Dave Pahl : Yeah, maybe I'll make a comment, and if you'd like to add in, Kevin. Yeah. Well, as you know, that's an area that we decided to step up investments going back several years ago now, back 2010, 2011, in that period. And the expansion of investments included both development teams to produce more products and begin to broaden the portfolio. And second is in application support, basically supporting customers and design-ins. So we feel really good about the progress that we've got. We have several years that we have gained share inside of micro-controllers. I think that we still -- I think some industry analysts will have us at like a number six position inside of the market. So we've got plenty of room to go. And those are the types of markets that take a while to begin to get traction, and somewhat like a flywheel that you keep investing, keep making progress, and that progress begins to snowball. From a product standpoint, we're really building out a broad portfolio. We're focused on catalog products, primarily going into industrial applications. You'll note inside of embedded processing we also have connectivity products. So there we support about a dozen different wireless standards. So we're getting very good traction and you can go to our website today and be able to find reference designs with micro-controllers ranging from $0.25 up to a couple of dollars using all of those different combinations of the connectivity products. So we feel really good about the progress. As I said in the opening remarks, embedded processing has had seven quarters of year-on-year growth, and a big part of that is driven from micro-controllers. Okay, thank you very much, Will. We can go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We'll move to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hi guys. Before my questions, also want to just pass on the congrats to Ron and to Dave on the promotion. Best of luck to both of you. I guess, Kevin, one clarification for -- that I wanted to get from you if I could. What was the starting point off of which that $130 million in savings exiting this year was going to be achieved? Kevin March : Ross, we announced that action with our first quarter result, and we took -- excuse me, the fourth quarter and first quarter results, as I recall. On our fourth quarter, we took the charge, and first quarter, for embedded processing. So that's the start there. In the second quarter we took the charge for the Japan restructuring. So it's a bit of a mixed start, if you will. So it'd be a little hard to do a direct correlation, but again the math you should be using is $130 million annualized savings by the time we end the year with 85% of it coming out of OpEx. Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Great. And I guess as my follow-up, in the past, and I don\u2019t know if you guys are going to do this anymore now that you've started to split out the revenues in a different way, but in the past, in the middle of the year you would say what the revenues by end-market did midyear. Is that something that you can give us now? Dave Pahl : Yeah, Ross, we're really just planning on getting those numbers on an annualized basis, as I answered Jim's question earlier, you know, we'll provide revenue on a quarterly basis, just a color on what's happened in each of the markets. And that's what we've decided to move to. So with that, we can move to our next caller please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Yes. Thank you, Ron, and best wishes in your retirement. First question, you talked a lot about strength being broad-based, but was there any segments of markets in Q3 that are relatively weak, you know, whether that's seasonal or even secular [ph]? Dave Pahl : From an end-market standpoint, Tore, the only market that we saw a decline was in personal electronics, and that was -- I'm sorry, was it third quarter or second quarter? Tore Svanberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Q3 guidance. Dave Pahl : I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, again, I somewhat addressed that, that we're really not trying to get into the color by end-market or our product segments or that. We realty just focus on the top-line number overall. Did you have a follow-on, Tore? Tore Svanberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Yeah, that's fair. My follow-up is, did you have a change in your distribution strategy at all in the quarter, or are you planning it? I'm thinking, you know, are you going to go to certain customers more of a direct business or? Dave Pahl : No. We haven't had any change in the quarter. I can't say that we had changes to our business arrangement with distributors, you know, on a periodic basis over the years. And for example, if we just go back a few years ago as an example, we implemented the consignment program with distribution. So now we've got more than half of our overall revenues supported by distribution. So they're going to continue to be a very important part of our business. We're focused on growing our revenues overall, which will mean growing our revenues with them. As we've invested in catalog products and in industrial markets, we want to work with the distributors to be able to broaden our reach with customers. So we will do things that will optimize both our resources and theirs, but any specifics of details that we've got going on with changes we just won't get into. Okay? With that, we\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We're going to take our next question from Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Research. Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Research : Thank you. Dave, just looking at the end-market breakdown one more time -- I apologize, I know this question has been asked several times. You gave us the year-on-year trends. Can you also talk about sequential trends from Q1 to Q2? Dave Pahl : Sure, yeah. I think aside from the increase in calculators, communication, and personal electronics actually grew the most, and we did see a benefit in personal electronics, led by a strong quarter in PC and notebooks. We did see industrial, enterprise systems and automotive all contribute to the growth sequentially. So if you look underneath that, and industrial as an example, we had -- we've got over a dozen sectors inside of industrial. So with that we saw areas like factory automation, control, smart grid, motor drives [ph] drive that. In automotive, on a sequential basis, we had growth in all sectors overall, and that was led by ADAS. So those are the things that drove the revenue in the quarter sequentially. Srini Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Research : Okay, great. Thank you. And then on the connectivity fund [ph], Dave, I think you mentioned you participate in a number of different standards, if I recall correctly, you sold the smartphone business a while back. My question is, is there anything preventing you from participating in the wearables market, if you think about the watches, et cetera? Dave Pahl : No. In fact, you know, you'll -- I actually wear some of those products to track my steps, and it has quite a bit of TI contact [ph] both from power management standpoint and other analog products, as well as connectivity. So the beauty of having a catalog portfolio is that the incremental cost to engage a customer, the tools and the support are all in place. So we can very readily and very easily support markets like that overall. So thanks, Srini. We'll go to the next caller please. Operator : And the next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Ian Ing \u2013 MKM Partners : Yeah, thanks. Just a clarification on being opportunistic in acquisition of manufacturing assets. Are you -- is it for taking a long view on increasing capacity or are you removing bottlenecks in the manufacturing flow? It looks like Richardson and analog, there's still a lot of headroom here. Kevin March : Yeah, Ian, it can be a little bit of both. If we see bottlenecks popping up some place and we're able to go ahead and pick up equipment inexpensively, or if we anticipate that a flow is going to become a bigger, more important revenue source in the future, we can go ahead and pick up for that. Or just outright new factories for example, and what's what we did when we bought the assembly test site in Chengdu, China. It was an entire that we had bought in that case. So we'll play -- we'll take advantage whatever opportunity presents itself, especially if the finances are compelling. Ian Ing \u2013 MKM Partners : Great. And this commentary on connectivity growing faster within embedded, I'm assuming, you know, we're talking about internet of things and wearables, sockets [ph] that could attach with micro-controllers and power management, and do you have a sense of IOT [ph] mix, how much of it is more like industrial, military, first responder type of applications with long cycles? Dave Pahl : Yeah, if you look at our -- the product portfolio, we actually support a dozen or so different wireless technologies, so, whether you need Bluetooth flow energy or WiFi, we've got GPS, we have multiple sub gigahertz standards, including things like ZigBee. So whatever label that you want to put on to that, essentially if things are getting smarter and more connected, we've got a broad range of catalog products in which to show the customers, and we can be fairly agnostic on how to solve their problem and bring really the best bit of the technology to whatever markets they're trying to enter. And oftentimes we'll find manufacturers that have, you know, never had any wireless experience, so they'll want to go to the web, they'll want to contact our local apps people, and get support for that product, and they really don't have to become RF experts. And so they can focus their time on other things. And that's a combination that's working real well. Okay. With that, we can go to the next caller please. Operator : And the next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group. Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group : Yes, thank you. I wonder if I could go back to some of your earlier comments with regard to the consignment revenue. I guess just to clarify that, I guess what you're saying is the higher percentage of fulfillment through consignment that you're expecting for third quarter is what's pulling down the book-to-bill. And I think in the past you've talked about your book-to-bill for the non-consignment portion of your business. Could you tell us what is and perhaps that's a better indicator of the end-market booking trends? Kevin March : Yeah, on the -- what I talked about, Chris, was that we've had a conversion of more products into consignment going to distribution. And so that suppressed the book-to-bill a little bit that we just came out of the quarter with. If you keep in mind that -- oh gosh, how much of our revenue is going through consignment now? Probably 50% for the total company is going through consignment. What that really means is that book-to-bill for that consignment revenue is by definition one. And so the book-to-bill that we reported at the company level really just applies to the other half of the revenue. So that 1.01 that we just reported in very simple terms will be 1.02 because it really applies to non-consignment portion of the business. And again that was suppressed somewhat as a result of a conversion from a previously directly sale to a consigned arrangement. Dave Pahl : Yeah. And Chris, I\u2019ll just add, in second quarter, you know, we delivered a 10% sequential growth and our book-to-bill was 1.03. You know, if you look at orders, they were up 9% sequentially. So, you know, that book-to-bill number is just one number, and as Kevin said, it's got some noise in it. So it's one consideration that we look at as we put together the demand forecast. You have a follow-on, Chris? Chris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group : Yes, sure. For my follow-on, I guess I'll ask a little bit of a bigger picture question. TI over the years has always been a cyclical company, just the function of the industry. But as you guys are operating the business a little bit differently now, your focus is on some different end-markets. Just interested in your view of, you know, going forward, what does that do to the cyclicality of TI as we go over the next couple of years? Kevin March : Yeah, I think you're spot-on, Chris. As you look at the mix of what's going on inside our portfolio, in years past, as you observed, we had some big verticals, certain end-markets you might be able to take a look at, and our business cycle with that end-market in addition to any so-called semiconductor cycle itself. Now as we have industrial and automotive becoming a larger and larger percentage of our total revenue and the market to which our products are being shipped into, arguably we would see -- likely see less impact as a result of big vertical fluctuations and begin to see a little bit more correlation between TI's growth going forward and the global GDP as a whole. So we'll probably track more to the economy as opposed to a particular single end-market. That's not to say that we escaped the semi-cycle if there still is one. It's simply to say that our fortunes are more tied much more broadly than they have been ever in the past, and therefore they're much more reflective of, you know, how does the overall global GDP tend to expand over time. Dave Pahl : Okay. And with that, operator, we have time for one last caller. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen & Co.: Thanks so much. Guys, based on your current schedule of depreciation, and if you assume that CapEx remains at roughly 4% of sales, when is depreciation going to hit the level of CapEx? Is this is a 2016 event or is this sometime beyond that? Kevin March : Yeah, Tim, it's unlikely that we would see CapEx and depreciation converge prior to 2016. So that's probably a good starting point for you to build your models with. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-on, Tim? Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen & Co.: Okay, great. Okay, great. And then a question about gross margin drop-through. You know, the number has been a little bit above 75% the last couple of quarters. But is that still the right number to think about going forward for the gross margin drop-through? I know people were talking about operating margin drop-through, but I'm wondering about gross margin drop-through. Thanks. Kevin March : Well, certainly we're operating at a higher level now, Tim, than we have in years past. And we talked a number of years ago about a long-term -- a long window of time that that fall-through during the course of a business cycle historically has been a pretty good indicator to follow. But in any one time period, it's always been -- it doesn't really apply very well. More importantly, going forward we'll operate into much higher level of gross than we have ever in the past, and I would expect that to continue to drop through quite richly, and importantly, drop through as free cash flow, that we can continue to return to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buyback. Dave Pahl : Okay, great. And with that, I will turn it over to Ron to make some final remarks. Ron Slaymaker : Okay. As we wrap this up, let me just close by saying the past 32 years working at TI really has been a good -- I'd say great ride. For Dave and Kevin, let me simply pass on the request and words of advice that had been passed down from generations of TI managers, and that, please don't screw it up. Thank you all for joining us. A replay of the call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : That does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin Marks, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliation on our website at TI.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for more complete description. The third quarter was another quarter that marked strong progress. Our core businesses of analog and embedded processing grew again with combined revenue of 10% from a year ago. Revenue of $3.5 billion came in solidly in the upper half of our expected range we had communicated to you in July. Earnings per share of $0.76 was at the top of our range as profitability was strong in the quarter. Our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We continue to believe that free cash flow growth is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term, especially on a per share basis. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 month was almost $3.5 billion, or 27% of revenue consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a 300 basis point improvement from a year ago period. We believe this reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy which includes our growing 300 millimeter output and purchasing assets ahead of demand at the stressed prices. We also continue to believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. Over the past 12 months we've returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends paid. In the third quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago with growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago led by power management. High volume analog and logic, high performance analog, and Silicon Valley analog also grew. Embedded processing grew 6% from a year ago due to microcontrollers, connectivity and processors each of which grew by about the same amount. Embedded processing delivered its eighth quarter in a row of year-on-year growth. In our other segment, revenue was about even from a year ago as a decline in legacy wireless products was mostly offset by growth in DLP products. Turning to distribution, resales increased 10% from a year ago consistent with our combined revenue growth in analog and embedded processing. Weeks of inventory were unchanged at a historically low level of just over four and a half weeks. This level was low because we've structurally changed how inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program. This quarter we continue to convert more of our distribution sales to consignment and now support about 55% of our distribution revenue on consignment up about 10 percentage points from a year ago. With this program, inventory sits on TI's of balance sheet and revenues recognized from distributors pull products from our consignment inventory that is stored at the distributors' locations. This program minimizes changes in demand due to distribution inventory -- channel inventory and most importantly, allows us greater flexibility to meet customer demand. From an end market perspective, TI revenue growth from a year ago was due to communications equipment, industrial and automotive, each of which grew by about the same amount. Enterprise systems was also up while revenue and personal electronics declined due to legacy wireless products. Now, Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Kevin? Kevin March : Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.04 billion or 58.4% of revenue. Gross profit increased 15% from the year ago quarter and gross profit margin hit another new record. This gross profit reflects higher revenue and an improved product portfolio focused on analog and embedded processing that benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy. Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $795 million was down $38 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in embedded processing in Japan that were previously announced as well as continued cost discipline across TI. Acquisition charges were $83 million almost all of which were the ongoing amortization intangibles and non-cash expense. Restructuring and other charges were $9 million benefit primarily due to gains from sales of assets. Operating profit was $1.18 billion or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $826 million or $0.76 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.38 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 108 consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $103 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.82 billion, up 17% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month the capital expenditures were $367 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectations for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue.  Besides inexpensively adding capacity ahead of demand, we have focused on delivering higher levels of customer service. By combining this capacity with continued improvement and how we manage inventory, we're able to keep our lead-times consistently low while continuing to deliver on time. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.45 billion or 27% of revenue. As we've said, we believe strong cash flow growth particularly free cash flow growth as most important to maximize shareholder value in the long-term that will be valued only if its return to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. In the third order, TI paid $319 million in dividends and repurchased $670 million of our stock for a total return of $989 million. As we've noted, our intent is to return all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds that we received from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. Total cash return in the past 12 months was $4.16 billion which was 9% higher than a year ago. In the quarter, we announced a 13% dividend increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.30 to $0.34 per share or $1.36 annualized. This marked our 11th consecutive year of increasing dividends and our 52nd year of continuous dividend payments. Outstanding share count has reduced by 3.5% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $3.19 billion of cash and short-term investments up from $2.80 billion at the beginning of the quarter. TI's U.S. entities own 81% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders in the quarter were $3.34 billion, up 6% from a year ago and our book-to-bill ratio was 0.95. This ratio would have been a bit higher except for the effect of the conversion to consignment of some products sold at distribution. While book-to-bill still would have been below one, this is consistent with the pattern that we're seeing for the past four years. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.13 billion to $3.39 billion in the fourth quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 8% from a year ago. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Restructuring charges will be essentially nil. Acquisition charges which are non-cash amortization charges will remain about even and hold at about $89 million to $85 million per quarter for the next five years. Our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 remains about 28%. This is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter. In summary the third quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in analog and embedded processing and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation and a broad sales channel. The result is diverse and long-lived positions in many markets. We remain intent on excellence in execution, disciplined in allocating our capital, and firm believers that free cash flow per share is the best long-term indicator of shareholder value. With that let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks Kevin. Operator you can open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for additional follow-up. Danny? Operator : Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead sir. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Kevin I guess my first question will be on OpEx. Clearly you are well ahead of sort of your expected annualized savings of $130 million with the restructuring actions. How do think OpEx will trend sequentially into the December quarter? And if you look at R&D as a percent of rev now below 10%, is that just a structural change in the model and how worried should I be at what scale level you should be investing on R&D for future growth? I understand that you are still spending absolutely a lot more money than most of your peers, but tough to see someone with your gross margins and R&D as a percent below 10%. Kevin March : Okay, John a think there were a couple in there so let me see if I can remember them all. Starting with OpEx and trends, the -- clearly OpEx was down quarter-over-quarter largely as a result of some of the restructuring actions we previously announced as well as just ongoing cost discipline in all the various businesses across TI. As you look into fourth quarter, if you just go back and take a look at a year ago that's probably your best gauge to take a look at the fourth quarter and even first quarter for that matter. We typically see that OpEx is lower in the fourth quarter due to holidays and vacations. In addition this fourth quarter, we expect a further benefit of another $15 million of cost to come out as a result of the restructuring that we announced on the embedded processing that's part of that $130 million of annualized savings that you were mentioning John. In fact we're probably running ahead of that $130 million of annualized savings right now. We're probably come up to beyond that. From the total R&D spend, as a percent of revenue, again, I think what's more important is not how much you spent, but how well you spent it. And I think the best indicator and how well you are spending is what's happening to your market share as a result of the products we're introducing into the market. In our case, if you take a look at 2006 through 2013, the last full year periods that we reported on, our total R&D spend is up 77% over that period. But most importantly, that R&D is a result in products where we have continually gained share. So, again I think John its less a question of how much you spend and a lot more how well you spend it and spend it on things that customers really carry about. Dave Pahl : Good. John you have a follow-up? John Pitzer - Credit Suisse : Yeah. Guys quickly just I know you don't give segment guidance or revenue, when I look at the embedded business in the September quarter, it was up only about 1.1% sequentially which is little bit weaker than I had been modeling and I'm kind of curious as to what you think might have driven that? And given that some of your peers have talked about sort of slowdown in the second half of September from a macro perspective, did any of that play into the embedded business in the September quarter? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Okay. So let me take that, John. I think if you look at the growth rates between analog and embedded processing, you can see a lot of quarters they won't grow the same. And I think if you look at -- both of those businesses they have different end market exposures and really it's those end market exposures that will explain most of the differences in those numbers. So -- and the second part of our question was, yeah, just -- did -- basically the overall environment impacting the growth that we've seen there and I\u2019d just say, no, that really isn\u2019t in those numbers. Basically that forecast is given off of the orders that we received from our customers. So thank you John. Can we go to the next caller please? Operator : Yes sir. Our next caller is Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets : Hi, thank you very much. Just on the overall demand environment. There is a lot of confusion out there, but it seems like things have slowed down, so just wanted your perspective. In the past you guys have given us certain things as you look at such as cancellations and so on and so forth. And also within that frame of reference, Dave, if you could please just walk us through your disti consignment versus non-consignment? And then how would you compare to somebody who claims that they are sell-through so they see a slowdown before -- a quarter or so before others. And then I had a very quick follow-up. Dave Pahl : Okay, so a couple of points in there Ambrish. The first is that, I just point out that all of our distributors provide us with a point-of-sale reporting and we get that information on a very regular basis. So regardless of how the revenue is recognized we see what's going on from a distributor resale standpoint. The second thing, you touched on the current environment, and we really want to be guarded on trying to take a position for the industry on where that\u2019s going. But we can really point to just what we see.  If I kind of step through those, our inventory on our books is at 108 days is within our target model. If you look at our channel inventories, those were essentially unchanged from last quarter. They are at a very lean level, at just over 4.5 weeks. Our lead-times have been consistent and I would say low. Our cancellations and reschedules remain very low, so nothing changing on that front. And then probably as we have grown over these last few quarters we've been able to support that growth and keep delivering our products on time at very, very high service levels. So, our operations continue to execute at that high level. So -- and then I will get to the last part of your question was what percentage of our revenue goes through distribution and what percentage is supported by consignment. So, the first one is, about 55% of our revenues go through the distribution channel and about 55% of that is supported on consignment. And as we pointed out in our prepared remarks that has increased by about 10% from year ago as we've had a couple of conversions go on this year. And I would say that we are not done with that. We actually expect that additional conversions will happen and -- over the next year or so, so we expect that percentage will actually increase. So Ambrish you have follow-up? Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets : Yeah, a quick follow-up, Dave, on the embedded operating margins you guys have had a steady increase, what's the right way to think about how do you get to North of 20%? Is it just a matter of focusing on the right product mix and getting that ramped up or is it something beyond that. Thank you, Dave. Dave Pahl : Sure. Kevin March : Yeah, Ambrish. I will take that one. On embedded processing there our margins have been continuously improving over these last few quarters and we would expect further improvement. Recall, I just mentioned earlier in the call that we would expect another $15 million or so of cost to come out of fourth quarter and most of that will come out of embedded processing. I would add that, from this point going forward, and we've talked about this last couple of quarters, the amount of spend inside embedded processing is sufficient. It doesn\u2019t need to increase anymore. What really the focus is revenue growth and that\u2019s what this is really about. And that entire team has been very focused on that. I believe they just recorded their eight quarter in a row of year-over-year revenue growth, so they clearly are working on the right metrics to really make that business start to deliver profitability at the level we expected to at TI. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Ambrish. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First I want to dig into the embedded processor margins again just a little bit. You had about $26 million in OpEx come out from Q2 to Q3. You had revenue in the Group, up a little bit or mostly flat. Margins were only up a little bit. Given all of that cost in theory I would have expected to come out of embedded processing, why weren\u2019t the embedded processing margins up more. It doesn\u2019t seem like all of those cost savings actually flowed through the margins this quarter. Kevin March : Actually they all flowed through the margins, Stacy, but not all through embedded processing. Recall, those actions incorporate both embedded processing as well as actions in Japan, which drove margins as well. Even with that at the EP level you did see about a 72% fall through on that delta revenue. So you're seeing it come through, but do keep in mind that Japan start spreading on some of the other businesses as well. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein : Got it, got it. That\u2019s helpful. So my follow-up, if I can dig into the gross margins little bit, I think both for this quarter and next quarter. So for this quarter you came in a little bit high, I guess, was that only the revenue upside or was there something else in terms of mix or other cost savings that push it up. And then for next quarter depending on how far you are guiding OpEx down, it feels to me like you are guiding gross margins implicitly flat to up in Q4 and quarter of revenues are down and typically your gross margins will be down in Q4 as well. So if you could give us any sort of feeling for what the gross drivers for next quarter ought to be in terms of mix offsetting revenue declines that would be very helpful. Kevin March : Sure, Stacy. I think that, clearly, the extra revenue came through and it was quite rich. We also had a slightly better mix of overall products that were shipped in the quarter. That combined gave us that new record gross profit margin of 58.4%. As we look into fourth quarter, I would not characterize our guidance suggesting that margins go up. We will be reducing loading some in the fourth quarter on a seasonal basis. Hence you can expect that margins will be down a bit, not very much, but down just a little bit. So depending on how you're building your model there I wouldn\u2019t assume margins increase in fourth quarter. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein : Got it. Dave Pahl : Yeah. Thank you Stacy and we will go to the next caller. Operator : Our next caller is Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Securities, Inc.: Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the solid quarterly execution. The markets have been focused on Europe and China as sources of potential weakness. At the same time the team has done a solid job on diversification and maybe that\u2019s what it is, the diversity of forging a more stable revenue profile. But at the margin, can you just talk about the overall health by geographies. Have you seen any signs of weakening above the normal seasonal trends that you would normally expect during Q3 or Q4? Dave Pahl : Yeah, sure Harlan. I would say if you just look at what happened regionally, year-over-year Asia and Europe were both up while the U.S. was even and Japan was down a little bit. And sequentially all the regions were up with Asia and Europe up the most.  And if you look specifically inside of China and how resales had done there, we had looked into that. And I'd just say that resales really just continued to be solid as we closed out the quarter. So that\u2019s basically what we saw. You have a follow-up? Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Securities, Inc.: Yes, absolutely. Thank you for that. You gave us some trends in OpEx into the fourth quarter. How should we think about OpEx as we move into the first half of next year? Kevin March : Harlan, I won't comment on first half, but I will give you some thoughts on first quarter. Your best way to analyze that, this could take a look at what happened from fourth quarter to first quarter of the most recent year coming out of 2013, 2012. We do have seasonal increases in OpEx as we go from fourth to first typically because of an absence of vacations that we have in fourth and the partial implementation of our annual pay and benefit increases that occur in first. So they will -- you should expect those to be up and you can take a look at -- again this past year to get a rough idea as about how much that increased by in percentage terms. Dave Pahl : Yeah. And I would just add, Harlan, that the -- as we indicated before, Kevin pointed out that we are expecting about $15 million more savings in fourth quarter at that point will be essentially complete on those announced actions. So, we will basically be just have a seasonal impact that Kevin had mentioned. All right, thank you. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Next caller is Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis - B. Riley & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. I will start off with a bigger picture question, Kevin. The company has done a very good job of looking forward and being proactive, taking action to either prune lower margin revenue stream such as wireless or identifying opportunities for cost savings such as the optimization program this year. As you look ahead how much further room is there for a similar such optimization efforts? Are we really at a point where the TI model is getting very close to being optimized? Kevin March : Yeah, Craig. I think that as we look forward from an optimization standpoint, I think the ones you've talked about so far have been more about where we might have trimmed areas that had opportunities perhaps not quite as attractive as other areas. I think perhaps one of the areas least appreciated as people look at TI on a go forward basis is the impact that continued delta revenue on 300 millimeter analog is going to have for us. The cost structure to build on 300 millimeter is very attractive. And so incremental revenue going forward on 300 millimeter, we expect to produce not only higher margins, but also higher levels of total cash on that delta revenue. Dave Pahl : You have a follow on Craig? Craig Ellis - B. Riley & Co.: Yeah, I do. Thank you. Dave, you mentioned the strength in analog power management on year-on-year basis. Was it similarly strong sequentially and what specifically is driving that strength? Dave Pahl : Yeah. So on a sequential basis if you look at our analog business it was up primarily due to High Volume Analog & Logic, as well as Power Management. Though we did see growth really from all four businesses, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley also grew. So, you see a little bit of difference there sequentially. But again power continue to strong in both comparisons.  Okay, thank you, Craig. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS Securities, LLC. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities, LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to draw down little bit on the embedded processing segment, in particular between micro-processors and micro-controllers and I guess DSPs and application processors.  Could you talk about some of the trends that you saw in Q3 especially from any, I guess, communications equipment exposure that you have? Dave Pahl : Okay. So embedded processing, as you know grew 6% from a year ago. That was driven by micro-controllers, connectivity and processors each growing by about the same amount. And again as Kevin pointed out that was the eight quarter in a row of year-over-year growth.  Sequentially, revenue was a little better than even, connectivity was up and processors and micro-controllers were about even sequentially. So, you have follow on Stephen? Stephen Chin - UBS Securities, LLC: Yes. In terms of gross margins, I'm just wondering if this year there is an opportunity for you to take advantage of building any strategic inventory for certain products that you know have good turnover and hence maybe further optimize gross margins a little bit in a seasonally slower quarter. Thanks. Kevin March : Yeah, Stephen, we do that on ongoing basis. That\u2019s one of the ways that we\u2019re able to keep sort of lead-time for the overwhelming majority of our parts to six weeks or less. In fact, we build the stock not necessarily build the order. Meaning, we maintain a stock of inventory such that we can always have short lead-times from our customers. So from a strategic standpoint that is done.  It does have a little bit of ebb and flow. As you point out, when we have lower loadings in certain quarter it gives us chance to build up on feed extra parts on that. But I don\u2019t think there is a whole lot of opportunity to do that just to impact the gross margins. I think we're really doing that to impact customer service. Dave Pahl : Yeah. And I would also add, Stephen that if you take the combined way that we are managing inventory now and we're being very intentional specific targeted programs depending on how quickly that inventory turns. But you take that plus the open capacity that we've got and the combination of those two things and we've really been able to execute at very high levels and deliver our products on time to customers. And so we think not only having low lead-times but also delivering product when you make a commitment to a customer, combination of those things are what customers would like to have. Okay. Thank you. We move on to the next caller please. Operator : Next we have Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley : Great, thank you. Can you talk about where your fab utilizations are now just qualitatively and there's still an underutilization charge to -- as part of these numbers? Kevin March : Joe on the underutilization charges, the answer is yes there are. But we're not really talking about those anymore and the reason is really kind of straight forward. We found that analysts and some inventories where on a conclusion that because we had underutilization that increase in our utilization would be the maximum amount by which we could increase our overall profitability if we put revenue into those factories, and that\u2019s really an incomplete answer. Remind you that our stated strategy is to invest in our capacity ahead of demand by definition. That means we will have open capacity and underutilization cost. Our purpose of providing ahead of demand is to purchase that capacity with as little cash as possible. So the utilization charge is mostly a non-cash charge and it tends to mix the point that our objective is to maximizing free cash flow. So for that reason you haven't really heard us commenting on or quantifying underutilization charges this past few quarters and unlikely to in the future unless there is some material changes that causes the better understanding of what's going on. Dave Pahl : And Joe, I will just add, the last time we had stated our end-to-end capacity, it was in the $18 billion range. So if you want to get a qualitative feel of where capacity is, you can annualize our quarterly revenues and put it against that number and it will get you into the zip code. So you have a follow on Joe? Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley : Yeah. Thank you for that. In terms, could you give us an update on the base station market? And I know you said that continue to be strong. Just anything that you are seeing from that end market? Dave Pahl : Well, if I just look at the communications market overall and I would -- from a year-on-year standpoint it was up primarily due to wireless infrastructure, while sequentially it was down. And basically we just saw that in -- as a seasonal pause in the fourth quarter. So thank you very much\u2026 Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Dave Pahl : And we go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next caller is Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Dave Pahl : Hi Vivek. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hello. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned a very interesting thing on improving output from your 300 millimeter fab and I was wondering if you could give us some more color around what percentage of your starts are moving to that fab? And more importantly what that implies for gross margins? For example in the past you have mentioned about 75% fall through on gross margin. So as you increase the loading on 300 millimeter, what does that do to that number over the next several quarters or years? Kevin March : Yeah, Vivek. I don\u2019t know that I'm prepared to give you a detailed quantification of that nature. What I would just say is that, we've talked in past about -- just from the geometrics alone that the chip cost itself was about 30% lower on 300 millimeter than it is on 200. Not to mention that you also get better yield results and so on, so you get a number of different benefits. So what we are seeing happening is proportionally more and more new products that we're releasing are being released on to 300 millimeter, which means as we look out over the next year, two, three, four years, more and more of our revenue will be sourced off of 300 millimeter, which inherently means it's got lower cost which should allow us to incrementally increase our gross margins as well as our importantly our free cash flow.  Beyond that I don\u2019t have any specifics I will give you at this point in time. But I do want to introduce that confidence to people because I think it's been underestimated as to how important that to TI's continued progress. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Dave Pahl : You've got follow on Vivek? Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Dave, the question is on the end market mix, I believe, you mentioned comps was strong on year-on-year basis. I was wondering if you could just give us your end market mix overall for Q3 and how do you see those trends playing out in Q4? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Sure. Yeah. So on a year-on-year basis our revenue growth was due to coms equipment, industrial and automotive, as I mentioned before, each of which grew and contributed to that growth by about the same amount. Our Enterprise Systems was also up while revenue in personnel electronics declined due to legacy wireless products. So, if you kind of go down one step in each side of -- inside of each one of those, industrial, we've got about a dozen sectors inside of industrial.  And as we've talked to different investors over the last few months and as we are traveling around, it becomes clear to us that our definition of industrial probably isn\u2019t as well understood. And we've got -- years ago we used to define it as what it wasn\u2019t, meaning it wasn\u2019t coms equipment or it wasn\u2019t automotive or it wasn\u2019t other things. But now we've got very intentional definitions. We've got about a dozen different sectors that make that up. So things like appliances and building automation and displays and point-of-sale products, factory automation, industrial transportation, medical healthcare, fitness, lighting, motor drives, power infrastructure, things like that. So very, very broad, but very specific.  So when you look on year-on-year basis, we had growth in nearly all of those sectors with most of the sectors actually providing double-digit growth. It was actually led by medical and healthcare fitness and factory automation. But, again, we saw that growth very broad based. Automotive, we've got five sectors inside of that and I'll also just point that those sectors are actually out on our website of people are interested. But we've got double-digit in all the sectors, but led by passive, safety and infotainment.  Coms equipment, as I mentioned, was up due to wireless infrastructure. Personnel electronic was down due to legacy wireless products and if you take that out we did see growth in PC and notebooks and mobile phones and that was partially offset by some weakness that we saw in gaming. And then the enterprise systems, that\u2019s -- part of that is where our DLP products will sit and that was up due to projectors. So I will stop there. So thank you Vivek. We have a follow-up question? Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, that was my\u2026 Dave Pahl : Yeah, thank you very much. We will go to the next caller. Thanks so much for that. Operator : Our next caller is Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies: Thanks for taking my question. The first question is, historically, when you saw lead-times stretch for some of your competitors, not -- even if you are only time stayed stable, you would see not only double ordering at your competitors, but also double ordering at Texas Instruments as well.  And I'm wondering if you think something is changed structurally with how guys are running the business or how that industrial operates that might have changed that dynamic? Kevin March : Yeah, Mark. I don\u2019t know that I will speak for the industry, but I will speak for TI and kind of go back to comment we made earlier. As a result of us taking an approach whereby we intentionally invested capacity before we needed and therefore always have more capacity that was needed for that quarter's business. It allows us to be able to build inventory in a much more thoughtful fashion than we have in the past.  A consequence of that has been that not only have we've been able to maintain lead-times for the preponderance of our products that\u2019s six weeks or less for several years now, we've also been able to maintain a very high level of on time delivery to our customers against those lead-times. So when you put that together, what you've really got for TI is it's just a different way whereby we are managing our manufacturing footprint and how we utilize that manufacturing for purposes of managing inventory. As it relates to double ordering, again, one of the biggest things that tends to be evident when double orderings begins to popup as you start seeing cancellations or reschedulings beginning to ramp up. We do not see that and we have not seen that for some time now.  So I think the strategy whereby we have capacity ahead of demand and we use that thoughtfully to make sure that we can maintain relatively low lead-times is severing well to satisfying our customers at least as it relates to demand for our products. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-up Mark? Mark Lipacis - Jefferies: Yes, I do. And that\u2019s helpful, Kevin. And the follow-up is actually on that topic about the lead-times. I think earlier in the script you said you're delivering -- you are focused on delivering higher levels of customer service. And then I think you said, you followed that up with saying we are keeping lead-times consistently low. So, I guess, I'm just trying to reconcile when you say delivering higher levels of customer service, are you -- do you think that you have your lead-times over maybe a longer period of time have come end that they're just structurally shorter? Or are you just delivering them more consistently at a shorter time. So I just have to reconcile when you said, what is the higher level of customer service? What is the improvement have been? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for clarification. I think it\u2019s a real good question. So when we referred of that, we look at a bunch of different customer service metrics. One is just how many line items are we shipping on time and we've had some very intentional initiatives that have been set up to be able to ensure that that is a good solid number and we are taking advantage of both the capacity and our inventory to ensure that we are consistently delivering on time. And so that\u2019s one of the metrics that we look at and that\u2019s what we mean by customer service, it's not really changing those lead-times, but keeping them stable and then delivering products when we saw that we'll deliver them. It's really the combination of those two things.  So thanks Mark, and we will go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back, Kevin, on gross margin, if you could just go through what drove the offside versus your guidance, then you're obviously sustaining that going forward. Is there anything that doesn\u2019t repeat in such that --and it sounds like you can grow it off this space. Just want to make sure I heard that right. Kevin March : Yeah, Blayne, the guidance actually -- we are up a little bit from guidance, not a huge amount. But really what we have was little bit more revenue come through. But importantly we also have a slightly better mix of product that we ship to our customer. And so combined that gave us a slightly higher gross margin than previous expected. And then on a go forward basis, again, that mix continues to be in our favor as we go forward and so consequently as we look into fourth quarter our margins will continue to be quite strong. And importantly, because of the rather unique situation that we have with 300 millimeter analog manufacturing capacity, we have significant opportunity to continue to drive not just improved margins but importantly good cash flow. Again, I will remind you some of the things that we do. We've got 300 millimeter analog. I do want to make that point of having it. We've got a lot more of our revenue coming from catalog parts which inherently tend to have more attractive margin characteristics. We have increasing portions of our revenue coming from industrial and automotive spaces and those three concepts are pretty important. Catalog parts, industrial, automotive tend to have very nice long revenue streams, which means we have plenty of time to figure out and maximize our cost efficiency from production standpoint and maximize our revenue and cash flow off that. Now, we've got increasing customer diversity. So our dependence on any one customer and therefore of the risk to our loadings or cash flow generation are diminished. And perhaps also very importantly we have a sales force that we estimate to be three to four times larger than our nearest competitors and those folks are becoming increasingly productive. And so we're beginning to get a lot more revenue per sales person which means we can grow revenue without having to grow OpEx as fast as revenues growing. Those things combined not only will help our margins, but also definitely help our cash flow. Dave Pahl : Okay. Blayne, you have a follow-up question? Blayne Curtis - Barclays: Yeah, thanks. So just for a big picture level, I think you already answered this, but I just wanted to make sure I missed anything. We've had seen some companies referenced part still weaknesses. I mean, I would say your results are normal, if not even better than normal.  Are you seeing any areas that are weak and you are offsetting that with share gains or strength elsewhere? Just curious your perspective or are you not seeing any weakness at all anywhere? Dave Pahl : Well, yeah, I will let you draw the conclusions from the numbers. I think that, obviously, the results are solid. I think that the outlook is consistent with the orders and our visibility into what customers are telling us they want from a consignment standpoint. So -- and from a share gain standpoint, I think that we've had multiple years now where we have had gain share, think it's always hard to tell in any one particular quarter that you're picking up share, but I think when you look back over a year, you can see that trend. So, we believe in our numbers, there share gains, but I'd be careful and anyone quarter to be able to point that out. So, thank you Blayne. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : Hi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the one segment nobody has asked about thus far is other, did a bit better than I had expected. Dave you broke down what was the year-over-year and sequentials with the sub buckets in the other two segments. Can you do that for the other segment as well? And if it is DLP, give us a little description on is there some seasonality in that that we need to appreciate going forward? Thanks. Dave Pahl : Sure, sure. Thanks Ross. Yeah, so on a year-on-year basis, again, other was even. We saw a decline in legacy wireless products and that was mostly offset by the growth in DLP products. On a sequential basis -- let me just finish year-on-year. If you look beyond that, calculators as well as custom ASIC business were up and royalties were down just slightly. So sequentially, revenue was up due to growth in calculators and DLPs. Royalties were flat and custom ASIC was down a little bit. So, I'd say that all of those businesses are performing well and if you look at DLP, they are typically stronger in the back half of the year in third quarter, but I would say that business is just executing well. When we look at that business longer term, I describe that it's got several wildcard growth opportunities. If you look at most of the business today, it will be centered up in the front projectors that you'll typically see in offices and schools and government buildings, but -- and it also has a solid cinema business, but from a broader standpoint, it's some opportunities inside of automotive as well as some embedded opportunities there as well. Kevin March : Pico as well. Dave Pahl : Yeah, the Pico projectors as well. So, thanks Ross, do you have a follow-up? Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : I do. Kevin you were helpful in giving us some balance around the OpEx and looking at prior years and how things have dropped seasonally due to vacations et cetera in both the fourth and in the first quarter doing the other direction. Can you give us a little bit of a harder number on what that typical percentage changes quarter-to-quarter? Looking back in the past you guys have had a number of restructuring programs that make it a little bit difficult to parse out what seasonality and what is restructuring driven in both the fourth of the first quarter? Thank you. Kevin March : Yeah, Ross I actually pointed to the last fourth to first transition with the idea, that's a good one for you to look at because in fact the timing of the announcement for the embedded process and Japan restructuring, you may remember we announced that in January of this past year, so we hadn't even begun the activities yet inside the first quarter. So, the underlying cost in there is fairly clean from a competitive standpoint between fourth and first and so I'd use that as your figure of (merit) [ph] to trying to figure where we go in 2014. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thanks Ross. That was helpful clarification. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next caller is Doug Friedman with RBC Capital. Doug Friedman - RBC Capital Markets : Great. Thanks for taking my-- Dave Pahl : Hi Doug. Doug Friedman - RBC Capital Markets : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a real strong results here. If I could Kevin maybe attack really high level one. You guys have been in the past very acquisitive so much so that you really rebuild your whole business model through acquisitions. Can you maybe talk about your appetite to maybe add some debt onto your already leveraged balance sheet? And what it would take for you to look at another significant deal? Kevin March : Okay, Doug it's not like may be there's two ideas in your question, one on M&A, one on debt. Clearly, on the M&A front, as you point out, we have been quite willing to take on M&A activities when it makes sense and our definition of what makes sense firstly has to be a strategic fit meaning that it really has to make sense for why we want to take the company. As we look at potential M&A in the future, it's most likely to be biased towards analog and probably towards items with catalog parts, service the industrial or automotive spaces. There may be others, but those are the most likely areas that we would look at. If it turns out that it checks off that strategic fit standpoint and of course, we'll have to take a look at the numbers and make sure that the price that we would pay met -- what I mean by that is not necessarily what its market cap is but the market we probably have to pay on top of that, that that total cost would be accretive to our lack or way the average cost of capital in the two to four year timeframe. So, there's the several test that we go through and we will make a termination on acquisition. As it relates to debt, as you know we have taken on debt to support acquisitions in the past. We think having the balance sheet available to support those kinds of strategic initiatives are important and a worthwhile thing for us to maintain for maximum flexibility as we move forward and so as we look out in time and even look at the last couple of years, while we have been issuing new debt, we've also been retiring older debt and retiring a little bit faster than what we've been issuing so that we're taking our whole debt levels down that's having the result of generally slowly opening the balance sheet back up to make itself available for any other opportunity that might present itself at some point in the future. So, that's how we're looking at M&A and that's how debt kind of roles inside that book. Doug Friedman - RBC Capital Markets : Great. Thanks for all that color. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-up? Doug Friedman - RBC Capital Markets : Yeah, I guess if I could, can you guys pretty much along the same ideas on the balance sheet and how you look at cash return, I might have missed it did you happen to give out the share price at which you bought back shares this quarter? And would you moderate going forward given the share price pullback that we just saw, how we should think about share count going forward? Kevin March : Let's see, we bought back $670 million worth of shares this quarter, total of 14.1 million shares, so that's an average price of about $47.62. I would point out that over the last -- since the end of 2004 beginning 2005, we reduced our total share count by 39% that the average price of those shares that we bought over that time, I believe were about $30.62 give or take. When we look to buy back shares as we talked about in the past when the intrinsic value we believe was higher than what the market value is, then it makes sense to buyback on a steady, if you will, dollar across averaging kind of basis, that's what we've done for many years and that's what you've seen us do here recently. In fact, the recent pullback in price is just allowing us to buyback a few more shares with the same number of dollars. So, that's kind of a round the world look at share repurchase if you will. That answers your question on that Doug? Dave Pahl : Yeah. Thank you, Doug. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Following Doug, we have Will Stein with SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Humphrey Robinson : Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. I'm hoping you can quantify a comment that you made earlier about the portion of sales on 300 millimeter today and that could increase over time. Kevin could you talk a little bit about where that number is now and where you'd see going over the next couple of years? Kevin March : Yes, Will, I think we're going to try to just hold back and say it is proportionally more than it has -- each period that goes by is proportionally more, but I think that we'll hold at a little while longer till we can get a more comprehensive look and better understanding for everybody on how to think about that 300 going forward. I just do think that it's -- again the highest level it\u2019s a fairly straightforward competition. 30% lower dye cost which means about 50% lower total -- total IC cost. And as we get proportionally more revenue going on there that will just incrementally benefit our margins on our cash flows as we go forward in time. That is something that I've become aware of and talking to investors the last couple of quarters that is underappreciated and what's going on inside the portfolio itself. William Stein - SunTrust Humphrey Robinson : That's helpful. Appreciate it. And as my follow-up, another comment that was made earlier was about I think the relative strength of analog versus the embedded segment this quarter and I think there was a comment about end markets, the end market mix helping, I am wondering if you could quantify that? Maybe help us understand of the better. I know analog is very diversified relative to embedded, but maybe talk about if they were maybe some end markets that were a bit more challenging that effectively embedded segment a bit more? Dave Pahl : Yes, I think if you look at embedded, it will have a high exposure to really three different markets. Its communications, equipment, industrial and automotive and like you said our analog business has a much broader exposure including exposure to personal electronics. It has obviously good exposure to industrial and automotive as well, but it's really those types of differences that will explain that performance. If you look at embedded processing and you look back at the growth rates between the two businesses, you'll note that often times they will grow at different rates. But if you look over that eight quarter period that embedded processing has been growing year-over-year, the growth rate for both of those businesses are essentially -- exactly the same, so kind of works out that way over a longer period of time. So, thank you Will, and we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : The next question comes from Tore Svanberg. Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Yes, good afternoon Dave and Kevin. My first question is on sort of the general environment, Q4 is obviously a seasonally down quarter anyway, it's hard to get a read on what's going on. But as we sort of -- or as you talk to your customers and we compare now let's say versus 12 months ago, would you classify the forecast in the environment as a better, weaker or about the same? Kevin March : Tory I guess I probably say that it's about the same. I wouldn't classify it is better or weaker, I said it about the same in that -- again we have had the same lead-times for several years and customers are ordering consistent with that generally speaking. You get some of expert from time-to-time because they've under-ordered or have a surprise on their but that was true a year ago and it's probably true today. And we continue to see customers manage their inventories of our products as they have early as was mentioned earlier and the distribution channel, we're at all-time lows a 4.5 weeks of inventory that's same last quarter and this quarter that's very low. From a customer standpoint, we see them again ordering lead-time and consistent ordering patterns so that tells us they are order -- they are keeping their inventories very low. So, I think overall I probably characterize it as relatively the same kind of customer demeanor today as what we saw a year ago. Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Yes, thanks Kevin, that's very helpful. My follow-up question Dave, if I have one. Dave Pahl : Sure. Please. Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Yes. So, your annual growth 10% year-over-year is that the goal internally to continue to grow the analog business 10% every year or was there anything unusual here the last 12 months that kept that growth rate so high? Dave Pahl : Well, I would say that internally we have very aggressive goals to grow the businesses and I just describe that as we want to outgrow the market significantly in analog, so we have got all the business units that are focused up on that. We do look at the performance of the product lines every quarter and we really look at a three-year compounded annual growth rate and stack that up against all the other businesses both inside of TI as well as competitors externally and that's how we measure it. So, again as I've said earlier a 10% we believe would represent some share gain, but it would be real cautious to look at anyone quarter and draw the conclusion or try to dice out what percentage of that growth would be from share gains. So, okay thank you Tory and we\u2019ll -- operator, I think we've got time for one more caller. Operator : Yes sir. And we have CJ Muse with ISI Group. CJ Muse - ISI Group : Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question it's a point of clarification on the OpEx outlook for Q4 down $15 million, is that all restructuring and then there's gravy on top of that in terms of seasonal savings or is that $15 million include the seasonal savings? Kevin March : CJ, the thing here to do is take a look at year ago third quarter, fourth quarter there was a seasonal decrease. On top of that will be another $15 million as the last rest of the EP restructuring is completed. CJ Muse - ISI Group : Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess second question, I was hoping you could talk about inventories downstream. Clearly relatively healthy on your books, but would love to hear what your thoughts are in terms of -- in particular at the [disty] level? Dave Pahl : Yes. Our inventories really from a day standpoint have remained unchanged at what I would just describe historically low levels, just a little over four and a half weeks. Again, that number is low because of the consignment programs that we have put in place. Beyond our distributors and into our customers, we do have a good percentage of our revenues on consignment overall and in fact, if you combine what we shipped through distribution as well as what we ship to OEMs on consignment that represents about 50% or about half of our revenues where we actually there is no inventory sitting in front of us and that manufacturing line for those inventories. So, we know that inventory number and it is zero. So, we have very good visibility into that portion and we do have a balance of the business that's kind of the classic -- I'll describe it as book ship type business where they give us an order and goes on to a backlog and we ship it at lead-time. So, -- and there we haven't seen any reports of large inventory pockets from customers, we're going through and racking up this quarter's results and we will see what happens on that front but we're not aware of any big pockets that are downstream. So, okay well thank you very much CJ for your question. Thank you all for joining us today and a replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate everyone's participation.",

Riley Mark Lipacis - Jefferies Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets Operator : Welcome to the Texas Instruments 4Q '14 and 2014 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Thank you and good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year-end 2014 earnings conference call. As usual Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our web at TI.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendar. We plan to hold a call on February 4, at 10 :00 AM Central time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done for the last two years on this topic, Kevin March will provide insight into our strategy and also answer some of the most frequently asked questions. Turning to our earnings update, the fourth quarter marked another quarter of strong progress. Our core businesses of analog and embedded processing grew again with combined revenue up 13% from a year ago. Revenue of $3.27 billion came in at the middle of the expected range that we communicated to you in October. Earnings per share were $0.76 and included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a $0.02 benefit from gains on sales of assets. Without these two items, our earnings would have been in the middle of our expected range. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.5 billion, up 18% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 27% of revenue consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 3 percentage point improvement from a year-ago period. We believe this reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy which includes our growing 300 mm output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. In 2014, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. In the fourth quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago with growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 14% from a year ago led by Power Management. High Volume Analog and Logic, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog also grew. This is the 6th quarter in a row of year-over-year growth for analog. Embedded processing revenue grew 11% from a year ago, due to growth in processors, microcontrollers and connectivity, each of which increased by about the same amount. It is notable that connectivity grew at the fastest rate as we continue to see more products being connected. This is the 9th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for embedded processing. In our other segment, revenues declined 14% from a year ago, due to legacy wireless and custom ASIC products. Turning to distribution, re-sales increased 14% from a year ago, consistent with our combined revenue growth of analog and embedded processing. Weeks of inventory decreased by a week from a year ago to a historically low level of just under 4.5 weeks. This level has decreased over the past few years because we've structurally changed how our inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program. This quarter we continue to support more of our distribution sales from consignment inventory and now have about 60% of our distribution revenue on consignment, up about 15 percentage points from a year ago. With this program, inventory sits on TI's balance sheet and revenue is recognized when our distributors pull products from our consignment inventory that's stored at the distributor's location. We carry higher loads of inventory on TI's balance sheet with this program which has several benefits such as minimizing impact due to changes in distribution channel inventory and giving us greater flexibility to meet customer demand. Turning to our end markets, in 2014 industrial and automotive combined were 44% of TI's revenue up a couple of percentage points from last year. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue, automotive 13%, personal electronics 29%, communications equipment 17%, enterprise systems 6% and other 4%. We continue to refine our understanding of our customers' end markets with better tools and software. On our website, we've included the last two years of updated market estimates and we've identified the sectors inside of each of those markets for your reference. Finally, let me make a few observations about the year overall. For 2014, analog and embedded processing revenue grew a combined 12% with analog up 13% and embedded up 12%. We gained market share in both businesses again in 2014. These two key businesses were 83% of TI's revenue for the year up from 79% in 2013. Because they now make up more of our revenue, they are driving top line growth for the company. TI revenue overall grew 7% in 2014. Now, Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Kevin March : Thanks, Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.90 billion or 58% of revenue. Gross profit increased 16% from the year-ago quarter. This gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory load-ins and an improved product portfolio focused on analog and embedded processing that benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy. Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $740 million was down $67 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in embedded processing and in Japan that were previously announced. That restructuring is now essentially complete and we achieved a little more than our estimated annualized savings. Acquisition charges were $82 million almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles and non-cash expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $27 million benefit, due to gains on sales of assets. Operating profit was $1.10 billion or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 60% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 38.7%. Operating margin for embedded processing was 17.0%, more than doubling from a year ago as we benefit from our investments for growth and as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing. While this is solid progress, we still have work to do in this business. We expect embedded operating margins to continue to increase as our investments in R&D and SG&A will continue to drive top line growth while we hold these expenses flat. Net income in the fourth quarter was $825 million or $0.76 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement for the federal research tax credit and a benefit of $0.02 from the gains on sales of assets. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.27 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, slightly above our model range but a number that we are quite comfortable with. It is consistent with a growing portion of our product demands being supported with consignment inventory versus customer-owned inventory. We believe these consignment arrangements give us better real-time feedback to end market demand that allow us to better manage our factories and maintain short lead times. We expect consignment inventory to continue to increase over the coming years, as distribution becomes a growing portion of our business. We will monitor the appropriateness of our current model of 105 to 115 days of inventory and possibly update this model in the next year or so. Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. In 2014, cash flow from operations was $3.89 billion, up 15% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $385 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the year was $3.50 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 18% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or protectively reinvested in the business. As we've noted our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement. In the fourth quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $698 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned in 2014 was $4.15 billion which is 3% higher than the prior year. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.3% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash in our cash management, our tax practices. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.54 billion of cash and short term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.18 billion up 11% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the first quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 7% from a year ago. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Restructuring charges will be essentially nil. Acquisition charges which are non-cash amortization charges will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next five years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 is about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. The rate is higher than the last year because of an expected increase in profits and does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. In summary, the fourth quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in analog and embedded processing and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation and a broad sales channel. The result is a diverse and long-lived positions in many markets. We remain intent on excellence in execution, being disciplined in allocating our capital and our firm belief that free cash flow per share is the best long term indicator of shareholder value. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Vicki, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Vicki? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Chris Danely with Citi. Chris Danely : Kevin, I guess if you had to characterize the overall environment now versus say a quarter ago or a year ago would you say broadly speaking not much has changed we're still in this fine roughly seasonal environment? Or have you seen any changes in visibility or your overall business? Kevin March : No, Chris, I think you said it. While it probably hasn't really changed all that much there was a slight change in our book-to-bill on a year-over-year basis. This quarter was about 0.97. A year ago quarter was 0.94, but frankly because more and more of our orders are coming in on consignment I think book-to-bill means less and less about a particular of where our revenue is going. So I think that to summarize our sense, it's more steady as she goes just like we've seen for the last few years of an economy just growing along on a steady basis and we're trying to take advantage of growing a little bit faster than that. Dave Pahl : Yes, and Chris, let me add, just, the other things that we see. If you look at our inventory, it's at a healthy level. Our channel inventories are actually down a week, as I said earlier, from a year ago, just under 4.5 weeks. Our lead times remain consistent, our cancellations and reschedules remain very, very low and in addition, we continue to deliver our products on time for customers. So those types of things are always a good indication for the overall environment too. Do you have a follow-up? Chris Danely : Yes. So it sounds like things are pretty normal, seasonal this year. Can you give us any sense of the relative growth rates of your major product lines this year? What you're expecting between analog, embedded and the other stuff? Dave Pahl : No, we don't try to forecast out a year on the major product lines or even at the company level. I will point out that both of those product lines turned in another year of market share gains and certainly, we're working really hard to do that for another year and we'll just have to see how the year turns out. Operator : We will go next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Ambrish Srivastava : On the inventory front, are we to assume now that your visibility now, vis-a-vis in the past is higher also, because of a higher percentage is consignment off the disti? And within that, that gives you better visibility? Is that the right way to think about it? So the days are going up versus what your targeted range is and really not comparable to if we look at the last 5 year and 10 year median. And then I had a quick follow up. Kevin March : Ambrish, I don't know that I would necessarily go to improved visibility, but we do get I would say a much more improved or real-time feedback from what's actually going on with true end demand for our products and the real benefit of that is that we can adjust our factories on a real-time basis whereas as you point out, if you went back a number of years, we carried far fewer days of inventory. But the signal as to how fast our products are actually being consumed in the end market also took a lot longer to get to us and so we'd respond later. Now, we can respond much more quickly. So it's less a question of improved visibility as it is a question of much more real-time feedback as to just how fast our products are being consumed. Ambrish Srivastava : Okay, thanks for the clarification, Kevin, that's what I meant because we always get into this debate in end cycles about sell-in and sell-through. My quick question is, what should we be modeling for CapEx for this year? Thank you. Kevin March : Yes. I would continue to recommend that you assume that we will average about 4% of our revenues on CapEx on average, over multi-year periods. Some years might be a little lighter like it was this past year where we came in at about 3% in 2014, but on average, we expect 4% and that's how we build our own internal models. Operator : Next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Kevin, 90 days ago, when you were talking about OpEx for the December quarter you said that looking back a year-ago and how it flowed a year ago was probably a good model and you even mentioned that it would probably be a good model going into the calendar first quarter. Is that statement still hold? Or can you help us understand the puts and takes on OpEx going into the March quarter especially around some seasonal costs? Kevin March : Yes, John, you're exactly right. So going from fourth quarter to first quarter, the best way to model that is to take a look -- really, the last year is a good starting point. We typically are up in the mid-single digits from fourth to first on OpEx and that's because of the absence of the holiday periods that we have in the fourth quarter and the annual startup of pay and benefit increases that we have in first quarter. This year we might be up just a little bit more than that versus a year ago simply because on higher profitability that we are expecting for the year, we also expect higher variable compensation accruals and so that may take our fourth to first up a little bit higher than what you saw about a year ago. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-on, John? John Pitzer : Yes, I do. Just going back to the analog space, Dave, maybe you can give us a little bit more color because it's pretty impressive. You guys put up double-digit growth year-over-year this quarter, against pretty hard compares from the year-ago quarter. So I'm just kind of curious to what extent do you think your market share gains could be accelerating around your consignment efforts? Or if you could just help me understand a little bit better? I know you talked about power leading the way this quarter. Can you help me understand a little bit more why the growth seems to be doing much better than some of your peers? Dave Pahl : Yes. I think when you look year-over-year first of all, it's good to have all four of those businesses contributing to the growth. Certainly, power is benefiting from just a secular trend of things wanting to run more off of batteries and things that do get plugged in becoming more efficient. We also have a very strong product line there too. So I think that those things are helping us to gain share. We've talked about for some time, that it's not one thing inside of a business like analog or embedded processing that allows you to gain share. There is a lot of things that you have to do to be a good analog company and we've got a lot of competitors that fit that category, but we've got other things, like the scale of our -- and reach of our sales force, our presence on the web, our manufacturing footprint, the technology that we bring to bear and the breath of the product portfolio. I think it's just all those things working together. Kevin March : I would probably add one more thing there too, is our strategy of -- that we've discussed for a couple years now of buying our capacity ahead of our needs and always have an ample capacity, quite frankly gives our customers, new and old, increased confidence that we have adequate capacity to meet their demand requirements and they see us consistently maintaining short lead times. So that's just another element that helps us be able to win market share versus some of the other competitors that we're up against. Operator : We will go next to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution. Thank you for taking us to the OpEx step-up here in Q1. Now with most of the embedded in Japan restructuring behind you, continued discipline on the team's part, how should we think about the OpEx trends beyond the first quarter? I think Kevin, I heard you mention your embedded OpEx kind of holding flattish, but how should we think about the overall business beyond Q1? Kevin March : So Harlan, I think the best way to think about that is we discussed -- I think it was back in 2011 that on average, we would expect our OpEx to run between 20% and 30% of revenues. So like in a weak market, it might be at the 30% level and in stronger markets it would be in the 20% level. We're performing quite well in our markets right now and so you're seeing that OpEx come down. In fact, most recently in the second half of 2014 we were running around 23% of revenue and so I would say that you would want to model us in the lower half of that range, as you try to think about how much our OpEx spend will be in 2015. Dave Pahl : Great. You have a follow-on, Harlan? Harlan Surveillance : Yes. Thank you for that. Your thoughts, directionally on utilization levels here in Q1? Given the seasonality in your business, I would assume that it's down again given the book-to-bill ratio and the revenue guidance for Q1. Is that also how we should think directionally about gross margins, as well? Kevin March : I think the way you need to think about utilization is first by definition because we buy capacity ahead of time, we will by definition be operating in an underutilized environment versus our maximum capacity -- theoretical capacity. But that aside, because of manufacturing cycle times, the material that we're starting in the first quarter, especially as we move into the second month of the first quarter, really is destined for second quarter shipments. So your utilization tends to proceed the quarter you're moving into as to what your expectations are and as the second quarter for the last 3, 4, 5 years now and normally for us is a growth quarter compared to the first quarter, we will adjust our factory loadings accordingly to our expectation to second quarter revenue expectations. Operator : We will go next to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Stacy Rasgon : I think to follow up on that gross margin question, it looks to me your implied guidance for margins is maybe 57, maybe a little higher, so low 57, it's down a little bit on revenues that are down slightly with inventories a little higher. Could you just give us some feeling of -- if you don't want to give numbers, at least some of the drivers for gross margins into Q1? And in particular, what are you planning to do with the inventory on your own balance sheet? How will that trend? Kevin March : Yes. I don't know that I necessarily have -- don't want to get into the GPM per se. Let me just talk a little bit more about what our inventory levels might look like and how that might drive us. We don't have an inventory forecast, per se, but given the growth in consignment and the typically seasonally strong 2Q, we would expect our factory loadings to increase as we move through the quarter as I mentioned a moment ago. One of the things to keep in mind, when you adjust your faculty loadings, if your quarterly loadings are really for the following quarter's expectations then if you think about the pattern of movement through the quarter you take your loadings. Coming into fourth quarter, our loadings would be dropping coming into the quarter and going into first quarter, our loadings would start to increase during the quarter. And so you're always going to have a bit of a lag, when you try to track the GPM that follows with that which I think is what you are asking for there, Stacy. I think more importantly, what we see going forward is that our margins we expect to continue to improve along with our free cash flow. By virtue of the fact that analog and embedded processing continue to become a larger portion of our total revenues and by virtue of the fact that 300 mm manufacturing continues to be a larger portion of our total production, as we go forward and both of those result in both higher margins and higher free cash flow. Stacy Rasgon : For my follow up, just to touch on the tax rate. So your guidance for next year, 30%, a little higher than your guidance for 2014 was which I think was 28%. I just wanted to verify, is the only real source of that just the higher profit versus expectation? I think you had told us before to tax every incremental dollar of profit around at the incremental tax rate, 35%. Kevin March : Yes. Stacy, that's correct. In fact, our tax rate in 2014, our guidance was as you said, they rounded down to 28%. It actually came in just a little bit higher than that, if it weren't for the R&D credit and so we're looking at it rounding up to 30%, as we move into 2015. So you're exactly right. As you model what you would expect our earnings and fall-through to be, you should tax that at approximately 35% Delta profit as it comes through during the year. Dave Pahl : And I'll just point out too Stacy, that that does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit that we got for 2014. Kevin March : Yes. If that does reinstate, that would be between 1 and 2 points of tax benefit. Operator : We will go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : Actually, when I look at your Q4 results versus consensus estimates, you did better in your core analog and embedded segments. But there was some shortfall in the other sales which are actually down 6% year-on-year. I think they were down almost 11% last year and I believe you mentioned some loss of ASIC business. I'm wondering, what is the right way Kevin or Dave to model this segment? Because it is a very profitable segment for you. It is still a decent size segment and I think in the past, you have mentioned that it could be flattish, plus/minus 2% or so. So just conceptually, what is the right way to model the segment? Dave Pahl : Yes. If you look back at the other segment, the first thing I would point out is, it has a calculated revenue and the seasonally strong back-to-school season happened, but in second and third quarter. So those tend to be the seasonally strongest quarter. Third to fourth, that biggest transition sequentially, of course is due to the change of that business. If you look overall, you can look at the components that fit inside of other. The first is DLP and I described that as a more steady business and one that might have some -- we've described as wild cards of new opportunities. The vast majority of that business is in front projectors today, as well as in cinema and we've got some -- what we call pico projectors or small form factor projectors that make up the revenue. But there is some opportunities inside of automotive and other embedded opportunities that could provide growth in the future. The next biggest piece of that revenue is calculators and that business has been, I would say flat maybe slightly down over time. And then royalties have run steady about $40 million to $50 million a quarter and that's probably a good thing to look and then we will have ASIC business that will transition over to EP over time. That is some business that's in communications infrastructure and we believe that that will move over. So you net all that stuff together and we think that the other segment will be flat, maybe up or down 1 percentage point, as we've described in the past. Kevin March : And I think Vivek, you also asked about year-over-year. Just recall that last year still had about $55 million or so of wireless revenue it in that this year is essentially zero. So that's your biggest decline on a year-over-year basis. Vivek Arya : Yes. So as my follow-on, back to your core business, do you think you have the right scale in your embedded business to take op margins into the 20s? So when I look at the three areas within that business; processors, connectivity, microcontrollers, how would you rank TI against the best competitor in that segment? And really, I'm trying to understand how you can grow that segment, gain share, improve margins while keeping investments flattish, while all your competitors are all investing in their respective businesses. Thank you. Kevin March : Vivek, I'll leave it to you to analyze the competitors. I'll speak to how TI is doing. You may recall back in late 2010 early 2011 timeframe, we significantly stepped up our investments in that particular segment in order to accelerate our product introductions and therefore begin to accelerate our revenue growth and if you take a look at what's happened over the last, as Dave mentioned in his opening remarks, nine quarters of sequential or continuous year-over-year growth that strategy has paid off. So those products are really beginning to take. And as you know, those kinds of products tend to have very long shelf lives, so we expect to see more of the same on that. Now while we took spending down this past year as a result of the restructuring actions we announced this time a year ago, we didn't eliminate them. The amount that we are investing is still quite high and that's why the operating profit is still not quite where we think entitlement will take us to. So we continue to invest at quite a healthy level, just not at the level that you saw us invest in in the prior few years. So those combined, the high levels of investment, an expanding product portfolio from heavier levels of investment in the prior few years, have all given us very strong growth in that segment and will continue to give us growth and quite frankly based upon some of the best in class performance that you can look at out there, we have -- shall we say, expectations similar to at least as well as those companies are operating. Dave Pahl : Yes and I would also add, Vivek if you look at our product portfolio like inside of microcontrollers, we've got two architectures there where we'll introduce new products with new interfaces and meet new standards, inside of that. A lot of our competitors will have half a dozen or a dozen, different architectures where they've got to spread their R&D investment over. So we can be very efficient with that. And in addition if you remember, as part of the wireless restructuring, we brought over those connectivity products that really already had a pretty significant investment in those wireless technologies. So we're supporting nearly a dozen different wireless standards today and that group is really focused on growing the top line rather than having to develop baseline technologies. Operator : We will go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello : A lot of great questions asked already. My one question is just around the long term segment goals that you might have. Auto is kind of low double digits, personal electronic is almost 30%, although that's coming down. Is the goal really from a segment diversification standpoint, to continue to increase in particular that auto sub-category and decrease the personal electronics category say, over the next two or three years? Kevin March : Yes Jim. Our goal is not necessarily to try to optimize that mix, per se. I would say that, if you look inside of personal electronics as an example, we'll look for places where we can find sustainable revenue with a differentiated position. And if you look at some of our largest customers that we sell products into, we'll sell several hundred devices into those customers and those products could be anywhere from $0.75 down to $0.05 and oftentimes, they may have lives that live from one generation of a product to another. So those are the types of opportunities that we try to look for in a space like Comms Equipment. Now certainly, from an incremental investment profile, if we had an extra $1 to spend and we had an opportunity to spend that in either industrial or automotive those products in general just tend to have longer life cycles and better characteristics. So that may see an increase in investment. And then lastly, I would just add that those two markets I think have the secular trends that you are well aware of. So we'll benefit from that as the rest of the industry will and of course, we hope to benefit disproportionately from those investments. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Jim? Jim Covello : Yes. I guess I'll stick on that topic. So personal electronics has been coming down, but your view would be it's not really a function of an intentional effort on the part of Texas Instruments. It's just more a function of the other businesses that you have or just happen to be better long term growth areas and it's naturally coming down. Is that the right characterization? Dave Pahl : And even more specific than that I think if you backed out legacy wireless, you'll see that it's actually been fairly stable, as a mix. So that change in percentage is more driven by the strategic decision to exit that one portion of the business. Operator : We will go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : I also wanted to ask about the end market breakdown that you guys provide. If I look at where you were a year ago, and there was probably some reclassification, but it looked like industrial went from 24% in 2013 to 31% in 2014 and personal assistance from 37% to 29%. Those swings seem dramatic. I just wanted to see if there was some change in the way you were looking at the breakdown? Dave Pahl : Yes, Joe. We continued to refine our understanding of our customers and markets and we've got better tools and software. So if you go out to our web now, you'll actually see two years of history that we have out there, as well as the identified sectors that those markets made up. Operator : We will go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis : Kevin, just to follow up to Vivek's discussion on embedded processing and expense control, it's really the flip side of that. Can you talk a little bit about what you're looking at before you would start to invest more in the business? It's clear you want higher operating margins than you have now but what are the things that TI is looking at before it will commit to incremental investment in that business? Kevin March : Yes Craig, I would say we're probably quite a ways off before we even have to entertain a question like that. Our focus for the next few years is managing the total spend inside that business and driving top line growth and frankly, if we begin to see top line growth then begin to net the kind of bottom-line results that we can see happening in other players in that space, at that point in time we might entertain increasing our spending but not until then. Craig Ellis : And then the follow-up is really taking another swing at something that Chris brought up which is longer-term growth on a segment basis. At least in my model, calendar '14 was the first year in the last four or five where embedded processing and analog had similar growth rates and they were both double digits. Just philosophically, as you look at those two businesses which have had very different histories, are there reasons why they should have materially different growth rates going forward? Or given that they are both closer to operating on more optimal levels, should they be fairly similar? Dave Pahl : Yes. I think when you begin to look longer term at the growth rate and the potentials of those businesses, I would start with what do you believe the semiconductor market will grow on. We have held the position that we think that the semiconductor market roughly grows at twice the rate of GDP. There is some that will violently agree with this and some that will violently disagree with that basic assumption. But whatever that assumption is, we think both analog and Embedded Processing are big enough portions of the market that they will grow in-line with that. If you look at those businesses certainly over the last five years, they both have continued to gain share and we believe that we're continuing to invest and we've got a lot of room to gain share. And in fact, in analog we've got 18.3% market share and inside of Embedded Processing, we've got around 15 percentage points. So lots of headroom to do that and we've gained probably 30, 40, sometimes more than that in market share on a given year. We still have to have everyone report before all the final numbers are in but we're confident that we'll gain share again this year. So Kevin, do you have anything to add to that? Kevin March : Yes. Craig, one thing I would recommend you maybe take a look at. If you do look at those two segments, analog and embedded processing, their quarterly growth rates I think that was the point you were making. They can vary quite markedly from one another. If you look at the two of them on a year-over-year basis, they actually are much more correlated than you might expect. They're both gaining share as Dave was mentioning and are both growing quite nicely on a year-over-year basis. So if you do some measurements for those two segments on year-over-year growth rates and compare that back over the last half dozen quarters or so, I think you might be pleasantly surprised to see they grow pretty similarly to each other. Operator : We will go next to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Mark Lipacis : Kevin, as you go into your capital management conference call next week, could you just remind us what your historical philosophy has been on levering the balance sheet to drive shareholder value? Kevin March : Well Mark, what we've talked about on debt that -- we have debt on the balance sheet today. It will be there until 2023 because that is when the last of the current outstanding bonds matures and our attitude towards debt is that it will continue to be part of the balance sheet when the economics make sense and for us, that economics making sense means that if we can borrow at interest rates that we perceive to be below what we expect our inflation rates to be or correspondingly at less than our dividend yield, then we think that's probably a pretty good deal on behalf of our shareholders and so that will be the kind of parameters that we look at, as we continue to decide how much debt to carry on the balance sheet and as bonds mature going forward. We do actually have a $1 billion of debt maturing in 2015. We have $250 million maturing in April and $750 million maturing in August of 2015. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-on, Mark? Mark Lipacis : Yes. Thank you for that color. So the analog business operating margins are about 2000 basis points higher than the embedded. As we think about the potential profitability of the embedded business, are there structural reasons why embedded profitability could not equal the analog profitability longer-term? Thank you. Kevin March : Mark, I think the simple answer in my mind is it's difficult for us to find evidence of somebody in the marketplace outside of TI, who has been able to perform at those kind of levels. I think the economics are such that it'll be very attractive. It's going to be a great place for us to be in, but it probably doesn't quite get up to par of what you see in analog. I think analog is quite unique in what it can produce for companies and for shareholders who all own those companies like we do. Operator : We will go next to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Timothy Arcuri : Just a question again on gross margin and what the possible headroom is, I guess if you look at the embedded business, you're up to 17%, but if you look at some of the well-run peers in that space, they're doing sort of mid-20s. So maybe ask a little bit different way, is there any reason why you can't get the embedded margins up to the mid-20s? Kevin March : No. There is no reason why we can't do that. Dave Pahl : Yes. We've made good progress. Obviously, Tim, we still have work to do, but we believe that we can get into that range with revenue growth and so that's what we're planning to do. They've got a good start. You've nine quarters in a row of year-on-year growth and are making progress towards moving that operating margin higher. Do you have a follow-on? Timothy Arcuri : Okay. I do, yes. And then just relative to the inventory, certainly some of it is structural as you indicated, but is any of the rise in inventory related to your perception that June could be a little bit better than seasonal quarter? Kevin March : Tim, I would say that it's probably too early for us to call the entire second quarter. Right now, we're focused on first quarter. So the inventory that we've got staged today is designed to support our first quarter needs and then as we adjust our factory loadings in first quarter, that inventory that we build will be designed to deal with our second quarter needs. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect we will be ramping up our factories as we go through first quarter in support of second quarter and when we get to the end of the quarter we will find out how much inventory we're holding at that point in time. Operator : We will go to our last question from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Doug Freedman : I guess if I could dig deep into some of the results that you've reported and maybe some of the outlook that you might have by key markets out there. I think investors are interested to hear what you're seeing in the PC and server power markets as well as maybe the disk drive markets. And if you could offer some color on what you're seeing in the communications market as well? I think those are -- maybe not that overly material to the TI story, but they are to investors in general. Dave Pahl : Okay, Doug, let me share some end market trends that we've seen. I think that that may address some of those issues, maybe not down at the level that you are quite asking. So I think you were talking about PCs and those would fall into our personal electronics products. On a year-on-year basis, they were up, despite the declines that Kevin had mentioned earlier in legacy wireless and that growth was led by mobile phones. If you look at industrial and I want to point out, when we talk about industrial we've been very intentional about how to measure that and it's different than when investors talk about the industrial market. And the sectors, we've got a dozen sectors that make up industrial and they include things like factory automation and control, medical, healthcare, fitness, building automation, smart grid, motor drives, displays those types of things, the full list is out on our website. And we've seen that was up led by medical and healthcare fitness. Appliance, factory automation and smart grid were also up from a year ago. Comms equipment was up due to wireless infrastructure and then enterprise systems were up, primarily due to projectors. So with that, you have a follow-on? Doug Freedman : Yes, I guess for my follow-on, just what are you seeing in terms of any shift in the competitive landscape? I know investors are somewhat concerned over what we're seeing in China from an investment standpoint. Is there anything in your markets that you're seeing that would point to any change in the competitive landscape? Kevin March : Doug, as it relates to China in particular, because you've mentioned that there we've been in China for a very long time now. We have I think over a dozen sales and R&D sites there. We have both a wafer fabrication facility and an assembly test site there. In addition, we have thousands of customers buying thousands of parts and consequently, we've become a very important supplier to a large number of Chinese companies across a very diverse set of markets. So we see China as continuing to be a great opportunity for TI regardless of any of the competitive environments out there and our goal is to operate in China just like we do in the rest of the world which is to make ourselves an integral part of their success and an indispensable supplier and we've got a great shall I say, a long way -- we're a long way into that already and we feel pretty good about our position. Dave Pahl : Okay. Great. Thanks for that question, Doug and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to talking to you again on our February 4 Capital Management Call. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Welcome to the Texas Instruments 1Q 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's Web site. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Revenue growth of 6% from a year ago was within the range of expectations we provided in January. Automotive and industrial markets were strong as we expected they would be. However revenue was in the bottom half of the range for two reasons. First was weak demand in the last month of the quarter and our personal electronics market, particularly PCs and our communications equipment market, particularly wireless infrastructure. We believe these markets specific issues were due to delay of investments by carriers and capacity upgrades for wireless infrastructure equipment and a weaker than expected refresh cycle for Windows XP.  The second reason was a steep decline in the currency exchange rate for the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. The Euro dropped about 10% during the quarter an even though only about 5% of TI's revenues transacted in Euros it was a sharp enough drop that it negatively impacted our revenue by about 20 million more than we had anticipated.  Even with these pockets of weaknesses our core business of analog and embedded processing turned in their seventh and tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth respectively. Combine these businesses grew 9% and we're 86% of our total revenue.  Earnings per share were $0.61 reflecting our continued attention to cost controls although the vast majority of our revenue was transacted in U.S. dollars ROE negatively impacted revenue by 20 million which translated to only about 5 million of impact to earnings and therefore cash flow.  This is due to a partial natural hedged against negative currency fluctuations due to our non U.S. based operations. It's nice to have position to be in this when we have almost 90% of our revenue comes outside of the U.S. But that is a backdrop, Kevin and I will move on with our report on business performance that we believe continues to represent the ongoing strength of TI's business model.  In the first quarter our cash flow from operations was $609 million. We believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months period was $3.6 billion, up 17% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 27% of revenue consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a two percentage point improvement from a year ago period and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300 millimeter output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. We also believe this free cash flow will be valued only if it\u2019s returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. For the trailing 12 months period we return 4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. In the first quarter TI revenue grew 6% from a year ago with growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago primarily due to power management and high volume analog and logic. Silicon Valley analog and high performance analog also grew.  As we mentioned earlier this is the seventh quarter of year-over-year growth for analog. Embedded processing revenue grew 2% from a year ago due to micro controllers and connectivity. Processor revenue declined which was impacted by the weakness in wireless infrastructure and again as I mentioned earlier this is the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for embedded processing. In our other segment, revenues declined 10% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC products which also are heavy in wireless infrastructure as well as DLP products. In distribution, re-sales increased 11% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory remained at historically low level of just under 4.5 weeks which is a decrease by more than a week from a year ago and is even with the fourth quarter. This level has decreased over the past few years because we have structurally changed how our inventory is managed and the distribution channel with our consignment program. From an end-market perspective versus a year ago, automotive grew with most factors inside this market growing at double digit rates. Industrial had broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew although growth in PCs was lower than we expected. Communications equipment declined due to wireless infrastructure and enterprise systems grew. Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Kevin March : Thanks, Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion or 57.7% of revenue. Gross profit increased 13% from a year-ago quarter and gross profit was up almost 4 points. Gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory load-ins and benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy as we built more analog chips on 300 millimeter wafers. Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $777 million were down $68 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in embedded processing in Japan that were previously announced. As we said that restructuring was essentially complete at the end of last year. Acquisition charges were $83 million almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles which is non-cash expense. Operating profit was $958 million or 30.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 35.4%. Operating margin for embedded processing was 18.3% more than doubling from a year ago as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing as we benefit from our investments for growth. Net income in the first quarter was $656 million or $0.61 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Flow from operations was $609 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 124 about three days more than planned due to revenue coming in at the bottom half of our expectations. Capital expenditures were $123 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 months basis, cash flow from operations was $4.04 billion, up 16% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $431 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes our $8 billion, 300 millimeter analog plan discussed in our recent capital management call. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 17% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or protectively reinvested in the business. As we've noted our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement. In the first quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $670 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.03 billion. Total cash returned in past 12 months was $4.14 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.2% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $3.30 billion of cash in short term investments. TI's U.S. entities owned 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.21 billion, up 5% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion in the second quarter. This represents continuing weakness in our communications equipment and personal electronics markets particularly for wireless infrastructure equipment and PCs respectively. We also do not expect a near term rebound in foreign currency exchange rates. We expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70. Acquisition charges which are our non-cash amortization charges will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next five years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year. In summary, we believe that the first quarter demonstrated the strength of TI's business model. While we're not immune to demand in currency changes, their affects are soften by the diversity of our portfolio in our markets. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks Kevin. Operator, you can now open the line up for questions. In order to provide as many of as possible and opportunity to ask your question please limit yourself to a single question. After our response we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Q - Jim Covello : Thanks so much for giving me the chance to ask a question. There is so much controversy in the industry today about whether the industry is as cyclical as it used to be less so, et cetera. I look at your year-over-year growth rates, the June quarter represents the first time you\u2019ve had a year-over-year decline at the midpoint of your guidance in a long time. How do you think about that in the context of an industry where many are arguing that we\u2019re not cyclical anymore? Kevin March : We\u2019re as you know we\u2019ve been pretty guarded at trying to predict the cycle it\u2019s not something obviously that we can control. We really just go to what we can look and what we can measure. So, as you kind of tick through the things that you typically look at from a cyclical standpoint, we look at channel inventories are down a week from a year ago they\u2019re laying at just under 4.5 weeks. Lead time are remaining consistent our cancellations and rescheduled are very low. In addition we\u2019re continuing to deliver on time and very consistently with that. So we\u2019ve got a couple of pockets of weaker than expected demands as we talked about specifically in wireless infrastructure and PCs. At the same time we\u2019re seeing automotive and industrial continuing to be as strong as we expect. So that\u2019s what we know, that\u2019s what we can see, the debates will continue on how cyclical our industry will be and won\u2019t be. Dave Pahl : I might just add that we do have several significant competitive advantages. The combination of which we believe is pretty difficult for anybody else to replicate and it helps us deal with any notion of cyclicality or non-cyclicality. And those advantages include that we\u2019ve got the broadest portfolio in the industry. This really means the engineers start their design work by looking at us first. We enjoy very low cost of manufacturing for all the reasons that you\u2019ve heard us talk about for last few years including our 300 millimeter wafer fabs. We have the broadest sales channel in fact probably two to four times larger than our nearest competitor. And we play in an extremely diverse set of markets with long-lived products that enjoy a significant cash returns to our shareholders for long time. So we think that what\u2019s really important to deal with whatever really happened in market cycles and just really make sure that we\u2019re a lot more competitively advantages than anybody else. Jim Covello : Obviously you\u2019re talking about some weakness in PCs and coms. In the industrial segment, we\u2019re starting to see some negative news flow from the customers. Do you see pockets of weakness but there is just other pockets of strength that are offsetting those industrial customers that maybe weak because I know it\u2019s a very broad based customer base? Or do you just not see any weakness at all in that segment at this point? Thanks very much. Kevin March : Jim, I\u2019ll just say that like you are hinting to its very broad based, so we service over 100,000 customers most of those will reside in industrial. And again I think it\u2019s probably helpful for me to just go through and when we say industrial it means something different than I think, the investment definition of industrial. So, it will include things like factory automation and control and medical, healthcare, fitness products building automations, smart grid, energy test equipment, motor drives, display, space avionics, appliances and other segments, so again very-very broad. Of course we\u2019ll always see pockets of strength and weaknesses but overall that industrial is doing well we\u2019ve seen growth in almost all those sectors that I\u2019ve described. Operator : And we\u2019ll go now to Chris Danely with Citi. Chris Danely : Dave, you did a good job of outlying I guess the relative areas of weakness in Q1 from currency and com and PC. Can you just give us which you think would be a bigger drag in terms of company sales from PC versus communications? And then do you guys expect a negative impact from currency in Q2 as well and if you could give us the magnitude of that negative impact? Dave Pahl : So the one that\u2019s pretty straight forward to identify because it\u2019s really just math walking through the numbers is that on year-on-year basis we\u2019ll probably see about a $50 million headwind due to currency exchange rates and obviously we\u2019re not assuming that we see a rebound in those rates. We\u2019ll still see and expect to see the weakness in PCs and wireless infrastructure. And it\u2019s kind of in the -- the balance of the business is as you know there is always puts and takes as an example second quarter a year ago DLP was very strong if you remember, it was benefiting from several world events one of them like the World Cup, that won\u2019t repeat. So, that will be weaker than it was a year ago and will continue for the rest of the year. But inside of that bucket we\u2019ll continue to have puts and takes. The other comment that I\u2019d just make on that that although we see those pockets of weakness if you look at the core businesses and analog and embedded we do believe that those will continue to perform well. You have a follow up Chris? Chris Danely : Yes, actually the couple of clarification, do we expect the PC or the wireless infrastructure to have a bigger drag on your revenue in Q2 or then it almost seems like -- do we need the dollar to weaken again for that impact to go way, i.e. if the dollar remains strong is that going to be like a negative for you guys every quarter. Dave Pahl : Chris, I\u2019d say that we probably don\u2019t have enough detail to tell you whether wireless infrastructure or PC which is going to be of a drag, we just don\u2019t expecting them to be recovering in the second quarter. As it relates to ROE recently with -- if you take a look at the just the euro alone versus a year ago it\u2019s down 23%. The yen is down 14%. We roughly average about 5% of our revenue in euros and around 3% in yen. So clearly with that weakness on a year-over-year compare that\u2019s going to continue to be an issue that\u2019s going to just affect that kind of math. It doesn\u2019t affect our ability to sell in those markets. We continue to make very competitive in those spaces and we enjoy on the design wins. But unless the ROE moves back and dollars weaken than certainly with that kind of dramatic decline in those two major currencies that will be at least on the fringes a year-over-year compare headwind for us. Kevin March : And I will just add to that like we saw in the first quarter where we had an impact of about $20 million, because of natural hedging we\u2019ve got the impact to operating profit and free cash flow is really only about $5 million. So, fairly small on that front. Okay, thanks Chris and we\u2019ll move on to the next caller please. Operator : We now go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for to let me ask the question. I guess I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse, but just on the outlook, when I look at the Q1 it looks like you guys are only missing the mid points of your guide by about 50 million and you explained 20 million of that on currency. As I go to Q2 if I just kind of anchor against seasonality you\u2019re kind of missing it by 150 million to 200 million and I guess sequentially are you expecting anymore kind of headwinds from currency? I understand the year-over-year compare I\u2019m trying to figure out the sequential compare. And when I look at PCs plus comp infrastructure, help me to understand the percent of the business that represents, I\u2019m thinking around 15; maybe I\u2019m wrong with that. I guess I\u2019m trying to get a sense as to why you think that the miss in Q2 is going to be so much larger than those two buckets in the mess in Q1. Dave Pahl : John let me, I\u2019ll take the first part of the question and Kevin can add in if he like to. The first, if you look at our PC revenues as a percentage of our total is around 4% if you were to include hard drives into that that will add a few points, so you will be just under 10% in upper single digits. If you look at wireless infrastructure last year it was about 10% of our revenue so obviously combined there you\u2019re in the mid-teen. So that will give you an idea of what that impact is. Again as Kevin kind of walked through the math of like the euros an example, last year 18% of our revenue was down in Europe about a third of that so 5% to 6% is transacted in euro and again sequentially, Kevin if you have any additional comments on the impact of the euro. Kevin March : Yes, I think just 1Q to 2Q, I think is what you\u2019re trying to ask whether John, the average ROE that we experienced on our billions in 1Q was about -- for the euro was about 1.13 and for planning purposes we\u2019re using 1.06 going into 2Q. This it is going to be little bit of a just a quarter-over-quarter ROE impact, just from that standpoint as it relates to the euro. Right now we\u2019re anticipating it again to be pretty flat. Dave Pahl : Any follow on John? John Pitzer : Yes. I know that was in the comp section specifically you guys were doing a little bit of pruning what\u2019s the product portfolio and I\u2019m wondering if any of the pruning that you\u2019ve done is being reflected in kind of either sequential or year-over-year growth rate. So do you feel like that that\u2019s not a factor as you look at the June guide? Dave Pahl : Yes, we don\u2019t believe that is a factor John. I think if you look at the impact that wireless infrastructure has, we sell more analog product than we do embedded or the custom ASIC products. So it actually hit both analog, embedded and other. Of course you can see the impact more significantly in embedded and other because it\u2019s a higher percentage of that revenue. But again we\u2019ve got a good position really across to most of the major OEMs there and so what we\u2019re seeing is really a change in chips and demand. Thanks John. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Stacy Rasgon : First I was wondering if you can give us a handle on where you see OpEx going next quarter, given the revenue short fall. Kevin March : Stacy, OpEx was up about as expected both quarter the first quarter and recall that, in the fourth quarter we typically down a bit on OpEx because of seasonality for holidays and so on. In the absence of those seasonality -- those holidays in the first quarter along with our annual pay and benefit increases; traditionally drives are OpEx up quarter over quarter. Those pay and benefit increases kick it in February so it\u2019s really only two months\u2019 worth inside the OpEx in first quarter. So we'll have the full three months, so you see a just very slight increase going to the second quarter. Stacy Rasgon : Got it, thank you, that's helpful. For my follow up, again on currency, I know you guys are pointing to sort of direct translation effects. We've had other players who have pointed to demand destruction from currency. I was wondering if you can give us your point of view on what you're seeing more broadly in the market. Not just to your revenues but also for your customers, are you seeing any sort of broad based [can] destruction because of the currency moments that we've got? Kevin March : Yes Stacy, we've talked about that. But there is no way for us to really point to some and demonstrate evidence that that's actually have occurring. Given the entire industry tends to price in dollars for the [indiscernible] of what\u2019s being shipped, it does not allow us other alternatives it would seem for customers from the demand standpoint. But that's not to say that might not be a second order knock on affect like what you\u2019re alluding to and we just don\u2019t see any way that we can quantify that with any confidence. Dave Pahl : And there are always pluses and minuses with currency movements, it's really impossible for us to quantify them. Kevin March : Okay, thank you. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : We go now to Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Given the timing when you start to see the weakness that you talked about in the March quarter and just given the softer than seasonal Q2 outlook, would you have to ratchet down your wafer manufacturing fab manufacturing activity or wafer structuring in Q2? Dave Pahl : Harlan, yes, we'll be lightening up the wafer starts in 2Q. I would caution you though that pulling back on the wafer starts doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that that will have a direct impact on our inventory. As the work in process in 1Q will become finished goods in 2Q, so we would expect our inventory to probably still go up a bit in 2Q, even though we pull back on wafer starts a little bit. Harlan Sur : Okay, great, thanks for that. And then analog was up nicely 11% year-over-year, despite the headwinds and embedded was up only 2% which is a pretty significant deceleration year-over-year versus the prior quarter, I'm assuming that, the embedded weakness was primarily driven by DSPs, given the muted wireless infrastructure spending environment? Dave Pahl : It's correct. It was impacted by the wireless infrastructure and in fact if you look at the businesses inside of embedded we had good growth in microcontrollers and connectivity both. But processors were down for the exact reason that you identified now.  Okay, thank you, we'll go to next caller please. Operator : We now go to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : One other avenue to get of the broad based demand trends, are you seeing any sort of difference in demand patterns from your distributors, customers relative to the OEM customers, are they getting any more nervous or excited and willing to carry inventory and I realize the weeks of inventory data that you gave before but from a bookings perspective, any color will be helpful. Dave Pahl : I think, I'll add just offer on that Ross, is that on year-over-year basis bookings were up by 5%. 60% of our revenue does go through [DSP], so clearly we're seeing one of the bookings coming to the [DSP] channel. The inventory levels are carrying over one and half weeks, just down about a week from a year ago, so they continue to carry lean levels of inventory. And I think largely that's because, they know that we carry Inventory and consignment and we also maintain very short lead times since we have for number of years now and so we get inventory quickly is pretty reliable for them when they order with us. So, I don't -- from those kinds of elements inside that space there is no rule again signs that we can looks at that says, there is demand destruction going on because of ROE, they really can\u2019t [indiscernible] there. Kevin March : And I have to add Ross that, if you look at our resale overall, that was very consistent with our combined analog and embedded sales. So they were in the upper single digits, very close to the same number. So you're following Ross? Ross Seymore : Yeah a quick one, I just to make sure that I have all the moving parts, it sounds like in an answer to your prior question Kevin, you said OpEx will be upper little, you also said, sound like utilization will be down, it seems like putting that together with your earnings guidance, it implies gross margin is going to be down at bit sequentially, is that -- one, is that may directionally correct? Two, is the cause of the gross margin simply utilization or is there some mix effect that I also need to appreciate? Thanks. Kevin March : You may be missing the mix effects inside there Ross; I don\u2019t expect much change in the margin. Dave Pahl : Okay, thank you for that question, Ross. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : We go now to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : In the markets that you're seeing weakness in PCs and wireless infrastructure, do you think -- is that an inventory or demand problem and I guess what is -- we seen other suppliers into the PC sector talk about return just sort of better in seasonal second half as you get past inventory correction, where do you stand on that? Kevin March : Joe, I just say, first of all that the wireless infrastructure market is has been notoriously been very choppy as you look at demand over the number of years. So, there is usually a significant build is -- OEMs are planning to bid for the operators spend and then it typically surprises us and there is an overbuild that occurs, so one kind of begets the other. We think that the wireless infrastructure market obviously long term is a good market for us and we've got a good position in and just as the numbers come down, they will come up again one day. On the PC side that's only a couple of percent of our revenue, so I don't think we really have any unique insight on that we believe that that weaknesses is due to the inventory that\u2019s created because there wasn't as much demand in the XP refresh cycle, but really nothing beyond that and we\u2019ll see how the rest of this quarter goes before we start making predictions on the back half, we\u2019ll just take a one quarter at a time. So you have a follow on? Joe Moore : Yeah and I guess specifically I think John, that you had mentioned the restricting that you did but just specifically you did cut back on R&D and macro based stations and I'm wondering if there is any anything directly that would point to that decision versus revenue seeing ours are completely separate from that. Dave Pahl : Yeah. Again I think that when we look at those markets they\u2019re very long tailed in product cycles. We continue to make investments, they are just not at the same rates that we were making five and 10 years ago and that's not unlike what we've done in other markets as they\u2019ve began to mature. So there is other areas of wireless infrastructure that looks like it will be very promising growth, like small cells and we continue to invest very -- at a very high levels there while we have very little revenue today so we would just believe that we've got to throttle that investment based on the opportunity overall. So, thanks for that question and will go to the next caller. Operator : We go now to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Timothy Arcuri : I have two questions. I had a question about the channel, did you see any meaningful cancels this quarter and I had a follow up on the inventory? Kevin March : No. We saw cancellations continue to run very-very low as we\u2019ve seen for a number of quarters now and same is true of reschedules too by the way also very-very low. So no patterns indicating change of demand there. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, great. And then Kevin you said inventory is going to be I think again you said in June despite loadings being down. I guess my question is, what do you think is sort of the -- now that you had a couple of quarters to think about the mix, when do you think is the right normalize level of inventory and do you think that we're going to come back down to that sort of that more normalized level during the back half of the year? Kevin March : Yeah, Tim. We are going to use 2015 the really kind of monitor the effect of all the changes we've been doing with the portfolio and with our operations to model what we think is a more appropriate overall level of average inventories to carry. What we did conclude was that the prior model which had worked for us quite well of a 105 to 115 days was appropriate giving the mix that we had, but clearly as we moved to more and more consignment, as we move to keeping lead times of very short across the vast abundance of our portfolio, I think faced with that we got to carry more inventory than we have in the past. And so we\u2019ll be using 2015 to run various test on what the appropriate levels of inventories are to meet the service metrics that our customers have come to expect of us and then probably by the time we get to early next year when we do our capital management update we\u2019ll go ahead and appoint a new model at that point in time. Dave Pahl : Great. Tim, thank you and will go the next caller. Please? Operator : We now go to Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah : Yes. Thank you. Kevin and Dave. I just I wanted to clarify how these two segments that comprised 15% of revenue are driving what I estimated as a 500 basis point miss relative to seasonality. Are you guys just being conservative in anticipation of may be a fall out in some of your other end markets or and I just not fully incorporating other parts of the equation here? Kevin March : So I will go ahead and just I think Dave attempted last time, I will give the try. There are several moving parts going on there when we look at 2Q and that compares on a year-over-year basis. So just the ROE alone impacts us about $50 million from a year-over-year compare for growth rate. Then you go beyond that and you've got continuing weakness and wireless infrastructure and PC's and you've also got the absence of the benefit the DLP had a year ago which was meaningful due to the World Cup and other large sporting events. In fact we saw some of that impact of DLP already begin to occur in the first quarter, as we mentioned DLP was down quite a bit in first quarter. So you got those kinds of headwinds, ROE, wireless infrastructure, PC and DLP and then we've got the rest of the portfolio basically doing fine, because it\u2019s simple with what we\u2019re been seeing in the economies for the last few quarters. Romit Shah : Thanks for the clarification Kevin I just wanted to ask you about M&A, there has been as you guys have seen a lot of activity over the last year and when I think about TI, M&A has certainly been part of your DNA over the last 10 to 15 years. Can you just talk about how you are thinking about M&A specifically in this environment relative to buying back your own stock? Kevin March : Yeah our M&A posture haven\u2019t changed at all. That meaning that most important thing is that to the extent that we considered an acquisition is got to be something that fits into our strategy that's consistent with our portfolio interest and something that we can generate long-term returns on therefore access free cash flow for our shareholders. If it kind of passes the strategy test then it's got to pass the numbers test. And frankly we have a hard time with many of the companies that are out there today making those kind of numbers work. Contrast that to when we bought National back in 2011, at a time when all some [indiscernible] stock prices were considerably lower and you can certainly see in retrospect that was a very good return for our shareholders. So we tend to be very disciplined on that. We\u2019ll continue to be disciplined on that. Buying back our own shares right now especially as long as they trade below the intrinsic value of the Company is that also it continues to be a good return for our shareholders especially from a free cash flow perspective. Operator : We now go to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Kevin, you've mentioned if you look at the portfolio, the rest of the business is doing fine outside of the factor that you've highlighted, if you go back to history and look at such a sharp destruction, just used that word, on the exchange rate when do you expect that to manifest itself in other parts of the business. So for instance the distributors in Europe and other pieces get that [indiscernible] go into for instance in industrial and autos, what does past currency issues tell us on that front? And then I had a quick follow-up. Kevin March : Ambrish, I had some clever insight on that but I am afraid I don't, just from an experience standpoint, I actually do not recall that my experience in this capacity and I've been in this role for a very long time now, seeing currency drop this sharply in this short of period of time. So I have not history from which to trying to get a reference point to answer your question like that. I think we're just all going to have to wait and see where this takes us. I think the encouraging part is especially in industrial and automotive is that the silicon content going in those spaces continues to increase year-over-year and so despite ROE impacts, I don't think that\u2019s going to slowdown the silicon content increases in those spaces. And frankly, if you look at the pricing of those and equipment\u2019s, the cost of a $0.50 analog chip going into $0.55 is pretty irrelevant to an automotive customer I think. So if you look at the more macro effect and especially where we see growth someone out there in auto and industrial, it doesn't seem likely that we would see a sharp impact in demand caused just because of ROE. There may be other factors that may lead to that kind of difference. Dave Pahl : And I'd just to add as many arguments putting pressure on the demand, there is as many arguments that it could help demand on the other side, so it's really tough to be able to quantify each of those into those impacts. Ambrish, you've got follow-up? Ambrish Srivastava : And this is a clarification in response to Ross's question, Kevin, did you say gross margin will be flat and if so the way to think about it is that factory loading goes down in the non-300 millimeter and 300 millimeter is continuing to ramp so that offsets that lower factory loading? Kevin March : That's a safe way to think about it, Ambrish. There is mix going on inside there but clearly we continue to ramp up 300 millimeter which is much more cost effective for us and so in balance we don\u2019t' expect much change in margins. Operator : We go now to Doug Freedman with RBC Capital. Doug Freedman : Just to follow on that mixed shift that you're seeing, Kevin, can you possibly give us the utilization on your overall factory base and the utilization that you're seeing in 300 mil? And then I have a follow-up. Kevin March : Doug, on the utilization, we typically would just talk about that as something drastic has occurred so I won\u2019t go into that right now. I will remind that you on a capital management call, I did discuss for RFAB in particular that we have the majority of the equipment necessary to support the build-out of that factory to a $5 billion revenue level and that into 2014 we had achieved about $2 billion worth of build for revenues in support of that. So call that roughly 40% utilized, but at the same time we're also converting DMOS6 from its exclusive use by embedded processing to also be able to be used by analog, metal add another $3 billion of 300 millimeter analog capacity in DMOS6. So you could say in a sense that our utilization of 300 millimeter may actually decline, but that's not because of loading, that's because of increase in our capacity. Doug Freedman : The question really that I have as my follow-up is when you look at the year-on-year growth, last year clearly you had a nice year but with the guidance you've just offered were actually down year-on-year. If we look at the long-term growth of your business, is there a point in time at which you might adjust what you think your long-term growth rate would be such that you felt factory consolidation would be part of the equation to drive higher efficiency? Kevin March : No Doug, factory consolidation isn\u2019t on our radar. What we're really interested in is very inexpensive factory acquisition with extremely low carrying cost that allows us to grow into it in a very efficient manner. As we've been talking about analog and a better processing combined for an extended period of time now, have been growing at about 9% compound annual growth rate. In fact even combined for this 1Q that we just closed out they grew another on 9% year-over-year. So they continue to grow quite healthy, I would expect that as we move forward in time we\u2019ll look at those factories that provide us the best cost efficiency and cash flow delivery and keep those operating in load and those that probably going to be biased in our note age towards 300 millimeter. Dave Pahl : And I just add to that if you look at the growth rates in time just look at what\u2019s happened in second quarter, the overall numbers are very strong, I mean if you look at our gross margins, you look at where our OpEx levels are, our operating margins with that 9% analog and embedded processing growth this quarter we turned in 27% free cash flow. So, our financial performance isn\u2019t predicated on having to hit a certain growth level we can do very well in a low growth environment or if things pick up we can, we are in a good position to build to support that as well. So thank you Doug and we\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : We\u2019ll now go to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : Maybe just looking back to the weakness in the PC market, you clearly had a fairly seasonal December. And I don\u2019t know if you saw any PC slowdown there, Intel sure didn\u2019t. But then looks like you\u2019ve figured correction in March. So, one, if you could -- I apologize if you already answered this. But within analog which your high performance and Silicon Valley is still up in March and really it was the PC dragging it down, if so would be down probably double-digit. Is that the right way to look at it? And then as you look to June, Intel is up, PC channel starting to turn around. Is it just that you\u2019re working through some inventory or if there is there any way you can quantify that and then kind of just help me with the math as to when do you really start to see that? Dave Pahl : Well, let me take a shot at it, and then I\u2019ll let you ask a follow up. Some of that I think we\u2019ve touched on. But again the weakness that we saw, Blayne, was really had manifested in March. And that was both in NPCs and in wireless infrastructure. Obviously, I don\u2019t know how that played out at some of our competitors but we do expect to see that weakness in second quarter obviously our guidance is reflective of that. So, I don\u2019t know if that helps or if there is part of that you\u2019d like to ask a clarification or a follow up? Blayne Curtis : Maybe I would ask -- obviously I can sign up for a full year forecast, so when you look at the businesses of PC in com, clearly they\u2019ve been down for several quarters here or will be with the June guide, to get full year growth would require a substantial pick up in the second half. Do you see these as headwinds this year for you and if so how much? Kevin March : Blayne, I\u2019ll just take that. We\u2019ll go ahead and forecast the balance of the year in front of each quarter when we get there. So we could just give you a guide, one quarter at a time. Obviously, I think you guys are probably better equipped than we are to come up with analysis to help figure out what the year might be and we\u2019ll just leave it at that. Dave Pahl : Okay, and that we are now out of time. So I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us today. And a replay of this call is available on our Web site. Good evening. Operator : This concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation.",

LLC Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Texas Instruments second quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the Web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago, inclusive of notably weak demand in communications equipment and continued strong demand in automotive. In the quarter, we also had about a $45 million negative impact year over year from currency exchange rates, as expected. Even in this environment, our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing together grew slightly year over year and comprised 85% of second quarter revenue. Analog delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.65, up $0.03 from a year ago. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $820 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing-12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 2 percentage point improvement from the year-ago period, and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's returned to shareholders who are productively invested in the business. For the trailing-12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. Analog revenue grew 3% from a year ago due to High Volume Analog & Logic. Power Management also grew, Silicon Valley Analog was even, and High Performance Analog declined. As mentioned earlier, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Analog. Embedded Processing revenue declined 2% from a year ago after 10 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. This decline was due to the weakness in wireless infrastructure equipment for the Processor product line. In contrast, the Connectivity and Microcontroller product lines grew. In our Other segment, revenue declined 17% from a year ago due to custom ASIC products, which are highly concentrated in wireless infrastructure equipment. DLP products also declined, while calculators grew. In distribution, resales increased 8% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory decreased by 1 week to just above 31/2 weeks, which is a historically low level. We believe this inventory level reflects an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. It's also important to note that inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because we've structurally changed how inventory's managed with our consignment program. Now I'll provide some insight into our revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago, which in total resulted in the revenue in the bottom half of our range due to more significant softness in communications equipment and incremental softness in industrial. Specifically by end market, automotive had strong growth, with almost all sectors inside this market growing at double-digit rates. Industrial revenue was about flat, in contrast to last quarter's year-over-year growth and was incrementally weaker than we expected. More specifically, there was growth in about half the sectors inside of industrial, but these were offset by declines in others. Personal electronics grew in total due to one large customer. Outside of this customer, almost every sector inside of personal electronics declined, including PCs, as we expected. Communications equipment declined primarily due to the wireless infrastructure sector, which was down about 50% from a year ago, even weaker than we had expected going into the quarter. And enterprise systems declined due to DLP projectors, as we had expected. In general, as we look to the third quarter, the strength in demand varies by end markets, but our market in total is expected to be weaker year over year, and our outlook for TI revenue and earnings is consistent with this environment. While we don't control the near-term environment of our markets, we do control the focus on making TI stronger through our approach to manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes taken together are at the core of what makes TI unique and capable of long-term free cash flow growth. Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.88 billion, or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit was even from the year-ago quarter despite lower revenue, as we benefited from lower manufacturing costs. Gross margin was up 110 basis points. Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $790 million were down $31 million from a year ago. The decline reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing and Japan, which have been completed. Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.01 billion, up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Operating profit margin was 31.3% of revenue, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Operating profit margin for Analog was 35.5%. Operating profit margin for Embedded Processing was 19.6%, almost 5 percentage points higher from the year ago, as we focused our investments for growth and now see the benefit from our plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing. Net income in the second quarter was $696 million or $0.65 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $820 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, as we had expected. As our business model has evolved, we continue to evaluate our inventory model. Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. As a reminder, in April, we retired $250 million of debt. In addition, we issued $500 million of five-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. Including the $750 million of debt due in August of this year, we'll have retired $1 billion while having issued $500 million in debt this year. This is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This will leave total debt of $4.125 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%. On a trailing-12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.1 billion, up 14% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $476 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the 300-millimeter Analog plan discussed in our February capital management call. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion, or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 13% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. And, as we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. In the second quarter, we paid $354 million in dividends and repurchased $654 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.08 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.1% over the past 12 months and by 40% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $3.31 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders in the quarter were $3.26 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.15 billion to $3.41 billion in the third quarter. As we've said, while strength in demand varies by end markets, our market in total is expected to be weaker year over year in the third quarter than it was in the second. This includes a negative impact of about $40 million due to changes in currency exchange rates. We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.72. Acquisition charges, which are a noncash amortization charge, will remain even and hold at about $80 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter and for the year. In summary, even in a weaker market environment, such as we saw in the second quarter and expect in the third, our business model, which is built upon the four attributes that Dave mentioned earlier, delivers strong free cash flow. As a reminder, these attributes are our approach to manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. We believe these attributes, in combination, are unique to TI and they are sustainable, giving us the ability to provide continuing returns to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Keith? Operator : We can take our first question from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks, guys. I guess a little bit of a longer-term question. Could you just give us your sense \u2013 having the benefit of six, seven months of hindsight \u2013 on why the semi market is kind of sucking wind right now? And then I think the last time things were like this was 2011 and 2012, so if you could give us a sense of comparison on how things are right now versus 2011 and 2012? Is it better? Is it worse? Is it the same? Do we not know? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, Chris, I'll go ahead and take a stab at that, I guess. I think that what we're seeing right now is basically customers adjusting their expectations as to the growth rates for the remainder of the year. And just toning down a little bit on where they're at. We actually believe what we're seeing is more a symptom of like a macro-based kind of event. The market's getting a bit more cautious, especially with all the news flow in the financial markets, things you hear out of Europe, things you hear out of China. But the fact is the signs that we're seeing suggest to us that we're in a traditional kind of market, macro driven, not necessarily a semi cycle per se. We continue to see lead times are quite short, cancellations remain low, distributor inventories at historically low levels, as Dave mentioned. So all things put together, I think what we're just seeing is a growth rate on a macro level that's probably slower going in the second half than what people thought coming into the first half. As to comparisons to 2011-2012, there were too many things going on back then. We had earthquake events in Japan that I can recall. We had flooding in Thailand. I don't think these are really comparable events that we can talk about on that front, Chris. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Do you have a follow-on? Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah, I guess just to dig in a little more. Maybe can you give us a little color on linearity? And then in terms of the end markets, you talked about softness in communication and the new softness in industrial. Maybe just go down your end markets as far as which is stable, which is getting better, which is getting worse? David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Okay. So I'll just make a comment on both revenue and order linearity in the quarter. In both cases, revenue and orders increased each month during the quarter. I think as you look at the end market detail, as I just had walked through in general, we saw automotive was strong, with all the sectors inside of that growing \u2013 or all but one growing at double-digit rates. Industrial revenue was flat. Just contrasting that to last quarter's year-over-year growth, we didn't see growth there. And it was incrementally weaker than we had expected. And as we had talked about inside of there, we really saw about half of the sectors increase, and that, of course, was offset by declines in the other sectors. Personal electronics, as we talked about, grew in total, due to specifically one large customer. And outside of that customer, actually saw almost every sector decline, including PCs, as we were expecting. Comms infrastructure, as we mentioned, was impacted by \u2013 or comms equipment was impacted by wireless infrastructure, and that was down 50% from a year ago. So \u2013 and that actually was weaker than what we had expected when we started the quarter. And then the last, enterprise systems declined due to DLP projectors, as we had expected. So that's kind of a summary of what we saw by end market. So thanks, Chris, and we'll move to the next caller. Operator : Okay, and that question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the Q2 results, you talked about incrementally weaker trends in Industrial. This has been a particular focus by the market. Can you just talk about the geographical trends within your industrial business? There's a lot of concern around demand trends in industrial in Europe and China. Love to get some color from you guys. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Sure, Harlan, so let me just tell you what happened with the revenues in the quarter. So year-over-year revenue was down, as we mentioned before, 2%. Europe was down the most, and Japan was also down. Asia was flat, while the U.S. was up. From a sequential standpoint, revenue was up, led by the U.S. Asia and Europe were both about even sequentially while Japan was down. So we're always cautious. We'll give you that information and walk through it, but we're always cautious, because that's reflective of where we ship product versus where it's actually consumed. So \u2013 and it's really hard for us to see regional weakness unless it's extremely pronounced in a market like industrial, just because of the tens of thousands of customers that make up that market. So do you have a follow-on, Harlan? Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure. So I think last quarter you said \u2013 the team said that they were going to bring down utilizations. Did you in fact bring them down? And, directionally, where do you expect them to head into the third quarter? And dollar inventory stayed relatively flat. Does the team expect this to come down in Q3, just given the weaker demand profile? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, Harlan, the \u2013 in fact we did reduce utilization in the factories in the second quarter. And inventory actually came in right about where we expected that, 126 days. And given the outlook that we have just described to you, we do intend to further reduce factory utilization in the third quarter, and we expect the result of that is that our inventories will probably come down somewhat in the third quarter as a result of the reductions that were planned for Q3 as well as the Q2. It just takes a while for that to flow through the system. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Harlan. And next caller, please. Operator : And we'll go next to James Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. First question is on consolidation. And you guys have been very clear in your articulation of what you look for and what the parameters are over time. But I have a couple specific questions about consolidation in the current environment. Does the current environment, where revenues for the industry are in some pretty sharp declines \u2013 does that change the view on near-term consolidation potential in the sense that you worry about paying a multiple for a cash flow stream that's going to wind up being much lower over the next 12, 18, 24 months than what it currently is? Or does that create more of an incremental opportunity? I'd love your perspective on that. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, Jim, the timing doesn't enter into our thinking. So with some of the points you just brought up \u2013 although they make for interesting discussion, they don't actually alter the way we tend to think about M&A. As we've discussed in the past, the first and most important thing is that any potential M&A consideration has to be consistent with our strategy. And in our mind that's going be something that's going to be focused on helping drive our success in the Analog space. And then beyond that, as you were alluding to in your comments there, we have been and expect to continue to be quite disciplined on making sure that we can get a return on what we've spent. Clearly, at some of the prices today that you might see of certain companies out there and you factor in a premium \u2013 I'm looking at what I've seen in some other companies \u2013 getting a 3% return, 4% return doesn't seem like a good long-term strategy for maximizing shareholder value. And so our inclination is to make sure returns can see their way past our cost of capital in a reasonable timeframe, and we'll stay disciplined on that front. James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's very helpful. Thank you. And for the follow-up, how do you think about what the company's long-term growth rate is in this environment? I mean, it was good last year. We're in a tougher environment now. We're kind of down on a year-over-year basis for revenues this quarter and maybe flattish for the year if we look at normal seasonality for the back half. This might be overly negative to kind of take this snapshot in time for long-term growth. Maybe last year was overly positive. Do you think something kind of in between what you'll achieve this year and what you achieved last year is a reasonable view on what long-term normalized revenue growth could be? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : I think you're probably thinking about it right, Jim, is that you should look at it over periods of time like that, and not start from the wrong quarter. At a high level, we take a look, and we make the assumption that the semiconductor market will continue to grow at, call it, 2x the global GDP, and that's on increased content into industrial and automotive that will continue to drive demand. It's then a question of what do you think the GDP's going to do over the long term, the global GDP? And clearly it does appear that \u2013 and certainly in the last three, four years, and probably the next few years, it has been slower than what we saw in the prior decade or decade before that. So the overall industry is, again, in our view, will probably grow at about 2x the global GDP, and the global GDP is the real wildcard here, is trying to figure out how fast that'll grow. And we're preparing ourselves for the fact that it probably doesn't see any real robust growth to help us, and therefore we have to focus on execution and making ourselves stronger internally. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah. And I'd add to that, that our business model is robust. Even in a weak environment like this, it throws off lots of cash. And we've got the capacity to support much stronger rates of growth, if that were to show up. So it'll be a lot more fun if we get into an environment where GDP growth is stronger and everyone can argue what the multiplier on semiconductor growth rates overall are. But we can still operate and produce lots of cash even in these weaker markets. And we'll look forward to having more fun when it's stronger. So thanks, Jim, and - James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Sounds good. Thank you. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Okay. Go to our next caller, please. Operator : And the next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Kevin, I guess the first question is you took some utilization action in the June quarter, but gross margins were actually up sequentially and very healthy. Is the right way to think about this is the June quarter utilization actions impact September, September impacts December? And, specifically, can you help me think about how I should be thinking about the gross margin range in the September quarter around some of the utilization actions you're taking? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, so Jim, we've got a couple things going on there. Clearly as we see more of our revenue coming from industrial and automotive, that has an attractive profit mix. And so you saw some of that in the second quarter. You heard Dave's prepared remarks talking about strength in automotive that we saw in the quarter. So that's clearly having a benefit to our gross margins, even in the light of lightening up on our utilization a little bit. You are correct in that utilization changes don't have an immediate impact. They tend to \u2013 it takes a few months for it to roll through the system, so some of that was in second quarter. More of it will be in third quarter. We also have lower overall manufacturing costs; as we're beginning to see depreciation starting to slowly trickle off we're becoming much more efficient in our factories; we're getting more and more of our revenue off of much lower-cost 300 millimeter. So you've got a number of things combined that are keeping those margins in a pretty healthy state. As we look into next quarter, I wouldn't expect a significant \u2013 any kind of material change in that particular metric in third quarter. John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's helpful. As then as my follow-up, guys, you guys are constantly kind of pruning the portfolio. One of the things that's been talked about is whether or not you're going to plan to do sort of power on the new Skylake platform. I'm just kind of curious as to how the PC business and your desire to want to participate there is impacting either the June quarter results or, more importantly, the guide in September? Is there sort of a hit coming because you're not going to participate there? Again, if there is, can you help us quantify the size of the PC business today and kind of where it goes over time? David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah. So, John, what you're seeing in our results has nothing to do with the investments on a Vcore product line. And I'll just say that we continually look at our investments, and we want to obviously invest in places where we think that that will lead to sustainable revenue, a differentiated position and solid returns. So there's portions within Vcore that are more attractive and less commoditized than others. So we're continuing to make those investments. So we know that there have been rumors out there that we're exiting the space in total, and that's not true. But, again, these are fairly small tweaks to where we direct our R&D resources. And those teams are off investing in other areas and producing products that we believe will just give us longer-term better results. So I'll contrast that to a market where we may have exited like wireless, where we're actually reducing and exiting a market. And we're not doing that here. So I hope that helps. We can go to our next caller, please. Operator : And the next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. A product mix question first : Within your Analog space, you guys obviously have done a great job over time. A little curious as to an explanation why the HVAL side is growing so much faster year over year over the last couple quarters versus HPA specifically? I recall asking questions about HPA investments in the past, and that seemed to be an area of extreme focus given its high profitability. But the growth doesn't seem to be keeping up with HVAL. So any color on that will be helpful. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Sure, Ross. Yeah, I think when you look at both SVA, as well as HPA, those businesses have different exposures to various end markets. And actually both of those businesses have a higher exposure to both industrial as well as communications equipment. You'll see a business like HVAL that will have a higher exposure to personal electronics. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : And automotive. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : And automotive. Yeah, good point. So that's really what you're seeing in those results. Do you have a follow-up? Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Switching gears quickly, but kind of a follow-on to John's earlier question, any sort of color you can provide on the OpEx side. It's helpful to have gross margin relatively flattish, but how do you adjust the OpEx given that the revenues have been a little challenged looking forward? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, Ross, we've already taken action on the OpEx side. We had announced, I think a year and a half ago now, actions that we were taking in Embedded Processing and Japan, and those are pretty much complete now. You're seeing those benefit OpEx in the results that we turned in the last couple quarters. These short-term fluctuations in revenue \u2013 we don't let those lead us to rash decisions that could have a negative impact on us. We make longer-term decisions based upon strategy. As we look into third quarter, if you look at the last couple of years, 2Q to 3Q, OpEx has been flat to roughly down. I don't expect anything different than recent history as we go into third quarter of this year. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Ross. And we can go to our next caller, please. Operator : And our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you for taking my question. For the first question, you mentioned this 50% decline in wireless infrastructure. If you could help us quantify what proportion of your sales that is now versus last year? And the thing that I'm really curious about is that \u2013 and it's not just a Texas Instruments question; we are seeing that from Xilinx and others \u2013 that there is really no slowdown in mobile data consumption, there is no slowdown in LTE users, so why are you seeing such a large decline in wireless infrastructure buildouts? Is it just an excess inventory of base stations? Is it a move away from your products? Is it a share issue? If you could help me understand that, that would be very helpful. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Sure, yeah. So, Vivek, our communications equipment market is \u2013 at the end of last year was about 17%. But the largest sector inside of that was wireless infrastructure at about 10%. So we've given you the color on half the size. We haven't gone through all the end equipment percentages, but that'll get you into the ZIP code of the impact to our business. And it's interesting that you bring it up. It continues to actually be a very good market for us. It's one that we're continuing to make investments. We had dialed back some of the investments a year or so ago inside of Embedded Processing, and that's really a view that that market over time, that carrier CapEx isn't going to go up, that it probably will decline slightly as we look over the next five and 10 years and perhaps longer. But carrier CapEx isn't going to zero. And that revenue will return. It has been notoriously just a choppy market. And it's just the dynamics of the market, the way that the tenders go out, the way that the OEMs have to prepare to deliver that product. Oftentimes it's in a 30- or 60-day window, so this isn't new to us. We're used to it. We can still make a lot of money and generate a lot of cash from this market, so we'll continue to do that. But it is just choppy. So that's just a characteristic. And I think as you talk to other semiconductor suppliers that supply into that market, that's pretty consistent, I think, with what all of us see. So do you have a follow-up, Vivek? Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thanks, Dave. So on my follow-up, wondering if 75% is still that right incremental gross margin number to think of, because you are guiding sales at the midpoint to go up somewhat, but you're saying gross margins will be flattish. And as part of that, does this slowdown in sales have any impact on how soon you move your capacity over to 300 millimeter? Thank you. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, Vivek, the 75% fall-through is still probably a pretty good one to use, but keep in mind that it's noisy from quarter to quarter. It's something you should look over a multiquarter period as you move through time. Clearly you'll get good product margin fall-through as we go into next quarter, but as I mentioned we're also dialing back some of the factory starts, so you have moving parts inside there. But when you look over a longer period of time than just a quarter, that's when you start seeing that 75%. As to migrating product to \u2013 I think you said 450 millimeter. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : He meant 300 millimeter. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Okay. I was going to say, we don't have that on the radar. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : He's thinking well ahead, yeah. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : For 300 millimeter, we will continue to do what we have been doing in the past, and that is many of our new products that are released are being released on 300 millimeter, and that becomes even more valuable to the company as we move forward. Keep in mind what we talked back in the February capital call, that is in addition to our Richardson fab, which is capable of about $5 billion of total 300-millimeter Analog revenue, we have also begun the conversion of our DMOS6 factory, which will provide an additional $3 billion of Analog revenue capability. So with that kind of conversion under way, clearly new products that we're releasing are being biased towards 300 millimeter versus 200. Active products on 200, for the most part, will continue where they're at. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah. And I'll just add to that, as we had indicated before, the qualification, as Kevin said, of DMOS6 second version is under way, and we expect the qualification to be completed by the end of the year. We're still on track for that. So thank you, Vivek, and we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : And the next question comes from Christopher Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group. Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes, thank you. I wanted to dig into the industrial market a little more deeply. You had talked about that being a bit weaker than expected in the quarter. And then \u2013 recognize that you're going into one of the seasonally weaker quarters for industrial. And I'm sure you heard the commentary from one of your competitors earlier today. Can you help us to just get some perspective on what your customers are telling you in that market? And I know you don't like to give commentary going forward on what's baked into your guidance, but to just kind of help ground us in how you're thinking about that particular market at this point? David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah. Chris, not a lot to add. We did \u2013 it was \u2013 again, use the word incrementally weaker. We gave you the color that we saw growth in half the sectors, and that was offset. So even inside of that, there's a bit of choppiness. I think as we look forward, obviously as we get the demand signals both in orders as well as from what we can see from consignment, through our distributors, there's signals that we look at there. And as Kevin mentioned earlier, I think people are just taking a more cautious outlook into third quarter. So besides that, probably don't have too much to add. Kevin, I don't know if you - Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, the only thing I'd remind you of is that industrial was 31% of our revenue in 2014. And my recollection is that no single sector in that market was bigger than 4%. So we're talking about a lot of really small customers. So there's not really one customer that can give us a signal what's going on. It seems to be a broad-based reconsideration on the part of participants in that space as to their outlook for growth for the second half. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Good point. Chris, do you have a follow-on? Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Sure. Just as following onto that, perhaps you could talk about what you think customers are doing with inventory now? And I know you had talked about your distributors taking some inventory out of the channel again as they likely reconsider what's going on in the second half. Do you expect that the end customers are doing similar? And, on top of that, what do you expect the distributors do with inventory as they go forward? Do you think the inventory levels can get leaner than where they are right now? David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah. So in general we believe that customer inventories are lean. As we worked our way through the reports and some of the anecdotal \u2013 from last quarter's reports, as well as the anecdotal information that we get from our sales teams. And of course there's always the exceptions like within wireless infrastructure, as that market goes through its adjustments. So with inventory in our distributors at 31/2 weeks, that is a historically low period in my tenure as well as Kevin's. So \u2013 and we really think that's reflective, Chris, of confidence from distributors that they believe that they can get the product that they need from us. Obviously it's driven overall because of the consignment programs that allow them just operationally to run at those levels. And I think there is a belief that confidence in stable lead times and availability of product is probably working its way out into the customer base as well; harder for us to actually have that direct visibility. As Kevin talked about, we're talking 100,000 customers, so it's hard to have that collectively. So thanks, Chris, and I will go to the next caller, please. Operator : And we'll go to Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC : Yes. Thank you. Kevin, you talked about orders increasing every month in the quarter. Do you have any order commentary quarter to date? And I'm assuming we're entering Q3 with a relatively strong backlog. How much more conservative are turns order assumptions to meet guidance? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah. Ian, as we did mention earlier on, orders increased each month in the second quarter, and I will just say as to orders for this quarter, they're consistent with the guidance range that we gave early in the call. We did have a book-to-bill in second quarter of 1.01, so we did build a little bit of backlog, but I wouldn't call it a dramatic amount. It's consistent, though, I think, with the outlook that we have offered for third quarter. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah. And I'll just remind you, Ian \u2013 I'm sure you probably know that we've got 60% of our revenues that go through distribution. 60% of that is supported by consignment, and about 55% of TI's revenues overall is by consignment. So I'd just be careful with the book-to-bill, and part of the reason why we don't highlight it is because it just applies to a smaller portion of our actual revenues, and that backlog isn't necessarily reflective completely of the demand that we actually see. So do you have a follow-on? Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC : Yes. I think you've done a really good job of highlighting your competitive advantages \u2013 broad portfolio, growing into your manufacturing assets. I mean, what's the response, though, to scenarios where there could be some demand in end markets on a permanent secular decline? I mean, if you look at comms infrastructure, PCs, some of the consumer markets, I mean, how do you address the potential for some permanent declines in some of these end markets? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Well, there's \u2013 been in this for quite a long time, Ian \u2013 there's always some market that's in decline and other markets that are actually in a growth phase. So the examples you just offered, if in fact they turn out to be in a secular decline, the offsetting markets for that, the most obvious one is automotive, where we're seeing significant content growth \u2013 not just us but many in the industry \u2013 seeing significant content growth. And we're still in the very early stages of that content penetrating automobiles. So that's probably a secular growth market that I would suggest would probably add for a decade or more. So that's a great opportunity for the industry in general and for us in particular, because we've been focused on there for a number of years now. And then there's the broader industrial market, where we're seeing an increasing usage of semiconductors and equipment in those markets that simply were never used before. And as people are using semiconductors in those spaces they're finding new applications and needs for more semiconductors. So while there may be some markets or sectors that could be in secular decline, there are others that are in secular growth. And in general, that leads us to the belief that I commented on earlier in the call, that we think the industry overall will grow at about 2x the global GDP because you've got these kind of underlying changes going on in how semiconductors are being used across our economy. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah, and I could add, too, that even if you look at a market like PCs that probably over the next 10 years and 20 years will be on a decline like that, we can take two actions. One is we'll spend differently today than we would have spent 10 years and 15 years ago inside of that market. But we can still find opportunities where products will actually live through one product cycle to the next and still have long-lived positions even inside of a market like that. And certainly PCs aren't going away anytime soon. So there's still quite a bit of money that can be made in those markets. So thank you, Ian, and we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : And we can take the next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thank you. Dave and Kevin, we're just trying to understand the difference in the commentary on the order patterns that you guys are seeing versus Linear. Same kind of diversified businesses; in fact, they have very similar \u2013 they don't have consumer as you do, but then you also had infrastructure, which is down very hard. So could you help us understand what's going on there? And then I had a very quick follow-up. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : You know, Ambrish, I cannot offer you any insight into Linear's order patterns. They clearly are the most qualified to do that. I can simply tell you what we saw, and that is our orders increased each of the three months as we came through \u2013 or two of the three months. In other words, May was up over April, and June was up over May as we came through 2Q. We certainly are in different markets, and that could possibly be an explanation, but I just don't know enough about how their order book works to be able to help you with a contrast between the two companies. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's fair, Kevin. My follow-up is on the factory loadings. Is the right way to also think about, when you're bringing the utilization down, that's mostly on the 200 millimeter, and the 300 millimeter continues to creep up? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : That's actually not a bad way to think about it, Ambrish, because in fact the way that we are operating the 300-millimeter fab today, our fab, is near full equipped utilization. In other words, we don't have it equipped to full capacity, but to the extent that we have it equipped, we try to keep it quite highly loaded. So the adjustments that we take on loadings generally impact the 200. There may be some impact in 300 as well, but it generally would impact the 200-millimeter factories. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah. And I'll just add that any product that runs any measurable volume will often source in multiple factories, so it could actually be sourced in a 200-millimeter fab as well as a 300-millimeter fab. And as you know, the economics of getting 40% lower cost per chip on a 300-millimeter obviously will tilt us into starting that 300-millimeter wafer. So thank you, Ambrish. And we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : And our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, not to beat a dead horse, but I guess another one on the industrial sector, is what kind of exposure do you have to the energy patch and your vision for whether that business has troughed and/or there's further declines ahead? David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah, C.J., as Kevin pointed out, last year 31% of our revenues industrial. The largest sector inside of industrial is factory automation. And that was 4%, so you're probably down well in \u2013 getting into the very low single-digit percentages by the time you're down onto that. So it's very, very diverse from that standpoint. Do you have a follow-up? C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Yeah. I do. I guess given your perspective in terms of your leverage to personal electronics, calculators, DLP, would love to hear your thoughts on the global consumer and the health of the consumer and willingness to step up and spend during this macro malaise or pause or whatever you want to call it. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Well, if you look at our personal electronics market, it was actually up. And it was up because of our exposure in our customer base. So to the extent that there's compelling products out there that people want, that will drive demand. So you see that stepping up. You take that one customer out, of course, we saw declines in almost every sector inside of personal electronics. So you kind of have the good with the bad, somewhat of a mix on that front. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, I might just add it's probably not so much consumer willingness to consume those things. It's more is there something interesting for them to spend their money on. And certain customers are much more successful at that than others. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you. C.J., did you have a follow-up? No, okay. Maybe one last caller, please. Operator : Okay. And we can go next to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you so much. Actually I had two. I guess first of all, if you look at 2015 as the whole year, usually you're targeting to sort of grow roughly 2x GDP. We don't know what GDP is going be, but if you assume a seasonal fourth calendar quarter, it implies that revenue this year is down like 250 basis points. So it definitely seems to be undergrowing whatever GDP comes out to be this this year. So I guess my question is do you think that any of this is share? Will you end up to have lost any market share this year? I know you usually target up about 40 bps per year. And then I had a follow-up. Thanks. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah. Tim, so what we're talking about, again, long-term growth rate was how the questions asked earlier, and long-term growth rate, we believe, will be about 2x global GDP. Just like you see noise in the quarters, you're probably going to see noise in the years. For example, last year the industry arguably grew considerably faster than 2x global GDP. This year it's apt to grow less than global GDP. So I think you're just going to have that kind of noise to deal with. I don't think it can be mechanically imposed into a formula with precision. As we look out, for the reasons that we talked about, increasing penetration in certain markets especially auto and industrial, that will continue to require semiconductor content, and there'll be growth inside that. From a market share standpoint, we'll be able to answer that at the end of the year. But I'd say we're off to a darn good start so far. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Yeah. And I'd just point out that when you look at our market share gains, they've averaged 30 to 40 basis points. We've had years where we've eked out 10 basis points, and a knockout year is 100 basis points. So inside of that, we've had a range of outcomes. So do you have a follow-on, Tim? Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: I do. Yes, thanks. So the guidance is like 400 basis points below what the five-year seasonal is. Maybe you talked about this and I sort of missed it. But can you sort of try to pinpoint what \u2013 the primary sort of either geography or end market that can potentially explain that gap? I guess I'm thinking about China in particular. Can you just sort of help us cover that gap? Thanks. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, Tim, we don't believe that there's something called a seasonal average in our space. When you go and take a look at any of those quarters, the variation is so wide that there's not really anything meaningful in there. I think you look at those 2Q to 3Q growth rates and you see zeros to high-single digits, and I don't think you can divine too much out of that. I think we have to look at it in the context of the current global environment. Certainly a lot of negative news flow coming out of Europe and some out of China and so on. We had a slow start to the year in the Americas because of weather and the port issues on the West Coast. So I think what we're seeing is what we talked about early in the call, which is that on a macro level, our customers are looking and adjusting their expectation for growth in the second half, and they're tweaking that down a little bit, versus what they had anticipated coming into the year. David Pahl - Director- Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you very much, Tim. And with that, thank you all for joining. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : Okay. And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments 3Q 2015 earnings release conference call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago. While our overall demand remained weak, most areas were stronger than we had expected, especially wireless infrastructure and industrial. In addition, our demand for automotive continued to be strong. I'll elaborate in a few moments. Even in this environment, each of our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew year over year. Together, they comprised 85% of third quarter revenue and have delivered nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.76. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing-12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28% of revenue, up from 27% a year ago, and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing-12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. Analog revenue, which achieved a record level in the quarter, increased 2% from a year ago. The growth was due to high-volume analog and logic. Silicon Valley Analog also grew. Power management was about even, and high-performance analog declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 2% from a year ago due to microcontrollers and connectivity. Processors declined. Our investments in Embedded are translating into tangible results, as this quarter's revenue is also a record. In our Other segment, revenue declined 19% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products and DLP products. Compared with a year ago, distribution resales increased 6%, and inventory decreased by less than one week to just below four weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program. Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive remained strong, with all sectors growing and three of the five sectors growing double digits. Industrial revenue was about even, with about half of the 14 sectors growing and about half declining. Personal electronics was up because of demand from one customer. Excluding that one customer, personal electronics was down. Communications equipment was down, driven by wireless infrastructure, which was down about 30% from a year ago. Although weak, it did grow sequentially. And, finally, enterprise systems declined primarily due to DLP projectors. We continue to focus on making TI stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.00 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 2% due to lower revenue. Operating expenses were a total of $750 million, down $45 million from a year ago, primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing and Japan. Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.16 billion or 33.9% of revenue. Operating profit was down 1% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.2%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 24.0%, 8 percentage points higher versus a year ago, as we focused our investments on the best growth opportunities. Net income in the third quarter was $798 million or $0.76 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 111, down 15 days sequentially. This reduction was the combination of lower factory starts, as well as higher-than-expected revenue in the quarter. As our business model evolves, we continue to evaluate our inventory model. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model to you in our capital management call next February. Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we retired $250 million of debt and issued $500 million of five-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. In August, we retired an additional $750 million of debt. As a result, we have reduced net debt by $500 million this year, which is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This leaves total debt of $4.125 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%. On a trailing-12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.11 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing-12-month capital expenditures were $512 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter analog capacity, as discussed in our capital management call earlier this year. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.60 billion or 28% of revenue. Free cash flow was 4% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested into the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt requirements. In September, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.04 per share, a 12% increase. This was the 12th consecutive year in which we've increased the dividend to our shareholders. We also announced a $7.5 billion increase to our share buyback authorization. In the third quarter, TI paid $348 million in dividends and repurchased $790 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.14 billion. Total cash returned in past 12 months was $4.23 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.5% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $2.74 billion of cash and short-term investments, with TI's U.S. entities owning 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.44 billion, up 3% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the fourth quarter, which includes about a $35 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus a year ago. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%. And this is the tax rate that you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. In summary, we believe our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of TI's business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you for taking my question. I guess for the first one, I'm a little curious, when you said demand was weak but the revenue was strong, and then you mentioned that industrial \u2013 I think you said, Dave, was even year on year but was stronger than you expected. If you could just give us some more color around the demand environment, because you have such wide exposure, what is better or worse versus three months ago, and what does it really mean that demand is weak but your revenue is strong? Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah. Well, what we were saying, Vivek, is that if you look, our revenue declined 2% from a year ago, and we obviously would describe that as a weak demand. That's actually similar to what we saw last quarter. But, inside of that, certainly it was stronger than what we had expected. There were a couple of areas that were stronger than we had expected. Wireless infrastructure and industrial were both stronger than what we had expected. So that's really what we're trying to say. We continue to operate in what we would consider to be just a weaker macroeconomic environment, and that's where we came in. Do you have a follow-up? Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, thanks, Dave. On gross margin, I understand that sequentially they were sort of flattish, because I assume you took some utilization down. But why are they sort of flat to down versus last year? Because I assume throughout this year, there's been a mix shift towards your core Analog/Embedded markets and a mix shift I guess towards more 300-millimeter capacity. So why aren't gross margins up versus last year? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, Vivek, the short answer is that our wafer starts were down in the quarter versus last quarter and also versus last year, and so underutilization was a little bit higher than it was a year ago. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Okay. Great. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong result. Kevin, just to follow-up on that gross margin comment. So utilization went down in the third quarter. I know you're saying you're going to update us on your inventory targets, but I think the one that's outstanding right now is about $105 million to $115 million, and you got there pretty quickly sequentially. So I'm kind of curious, how do I think about utilization going into the December quarter, and what kind of impact should I expect on the gross margin line? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, John, as we look into the fourth quarter, we're expecting our wafer starts will probably be roughly flat to what they were this quarter, so no significant change in starts there. And keep in mind that the wafers that we start in fourth quarter, other than for the first few weeks of the quarter, are mostly for what we expect in follow-on quarters. So we build quite a bit forward to our expectation of when that inventory actually gets sold. John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's helpful. And then, Kevin, as my follow-up, you guys probably were one of the first to start the trend of M&A with the acquisition of National several years back. There's been a lot of speculation in the marketplace about more M&A within the semi space. I know you've talked about this in the past, but I'd kind of be curious about kind of getting some updated thoughts from your perspective about the advantage from here given your already-hefty scale of M&A and how you guys are sort of thinking about that? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, John. So I guess it'll take me a second to kind of go through those thoughts there. Of course we acquired National back into 2011, so we probably got ahead of the game versus where people are at today. But we spent the intervening time period really driving hard to accelerate four attributes that we think in combination are pretty unique to TI and differentiate us quite a bit from our competitors, which may, in fact, be impacting some of their thinking about how they approach their markets. And those four attributes are our approach to low-cost manufacturing and advanced technology; the sheer breadth of our overall product portfolio; the reach we have to our customers through our market channels, especially with arguably the largest sales force of anybody out there; and the diversity and long-lived positions that we enjoy in the markets with the products that we have. When we look at what most companies are doing today from an M&A front, it appears that some of them may be changing their focus, and some of them may be trying to build scale. We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage, and we believe we're focused on the two best opportunities that are out there today, being Analog and Embedded Processing. So those two reasons aren't motivating us to think differently about M&A. When we do think about M&A, our approach is really to focus on the right strategic fit, one that can generate long-term returns and excess free cash flows. So we really do focus on the numbers that that acquisition might lead us to. And by strategic fit, I'm talking really our bias is towards Analog. If we were to look at an acquisition, it would probably be a company that's going to be broad in catalog, have a diverse customer base, have a large percentage of its revenue coming from industrial and automotive, probably have a very talented R&D team. Those would be the sort of attributes we'd look at from a strategic standpoint. From a return standpoint, we'd look at several metrics, including really making sure that the return on our investment is accretive to our weighted average cost of capital within, say, four years or so. And we also want to make sure that whatever we acquire can continue to expand our cash flow. So, with all that said, and we take a look at what's out there, we have been actually buying our favorite semiconductor company \u2013 I know you don't like to hear it that way \u2013 but through our own stock buybacks. Today, by buying back those shares, we're getting a 7% free cash flow yield on those acquisitions of those shares, and we don't have any integration risk and no banker fees. And just a whole lot easier way to run the business and focus on customers. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with the Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first question, I'd like to follow up on the industrial market. You said half of your markets were kind of up year over year; half of them were down. That's pretty similar to \u2013 the same as last quarter, but you do seem to be seeing upside versus expectations. Within industrial, can you give us some idea of which end markets you're actually seeing relative strength versus weakness versus those expectations? And talk a little bit about how your end markets within industrial are concentrated or not. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, so great question, Stacy. We've got 14 different sectors that make up our industrial market. And I'll just go through some of those, because I think some investors, if they focus on industrials \u2013 we mean something different than that. So it includes things like factory automation and control, medical and healthcare, building automation, smart grid and energy, test and measurement, motor drives, display, space avionics, appliance, power delivery systems, point-of-sale lighting, industrial transportation. And then a bucket of just other really small stuff. So last year, as you know, Stacy, industrial was 31% of our revenues. The largest sector inside of there was 4%. So you can see it gets very, very diverse very quickly. And even inside of each of those sectors we've got multiple end equipments that make each of those up. So it was very similar to last quarter, where we did see about half of the sectors up and the other sectors down, together flat. So there weren't really any really huge movements in either that we would call out to say that it was unusual. So that's what it looked like. Do you have a follow-on, Stacy? Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I do. Thank you. Around your OpEx, it seems like you came in fairly light in the quarter versus expectations. Why was that, and where do you see OpEx going next quarter? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : So, Stacy, on OpEx \u2013 if you compare it to a year-ago-quarter, that was really when we just had continued cost management going on across the company, and we also had the benefit on a year-ago comparison to the actions that we previously announced in Embedded Processing and Japan. And those are now done. So we get that benefit year over year. As it relates to sequential, even, as you say, coming into the quarter a little bit better than expected, that's really just cost management continuing. And also in second quarter there were a few items that didn't recur in second and third quarter, and so that gave us a good little benefit second to third. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Stacy. And we'll go to our next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In Q2, Embedded was up year over year for the first time. Actually, no, Q2 Embedded was down year over year for the first time, I think, versus the prior 10 quarters. It inflected higher in Q3. I know you guys said MCU and connectivity drove the growth, but what end markets helped to return this business back to year-over-year growth? And also what drove the 450 basis point improvement in operating margins? Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Okay. So I guess two questions there. I'll take the first one. So, as you said, Embedded Processing was driven by microcontrollers and connectivity, and both of those businesses tend to be very broad market exposures, a high exposure to industrial. We also have some exposure inside of processors to automotive. And what drove the weakness in second quarter and the reason why processors declined year over year was the exposure to wireless infrastructure, is probably the simplest way to say that. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : On operating margin, Harlan, the short answer is we had announced at the end of 2012 some restructuring actions inside Embedded Processing that would wind up last year, and in fact they have. So a lot of that cost is out, and so as a result their operating margins are coming through very nicely. Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, yeah. Nice job on - Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : And we'll let you squeeze in a third question, but we'll make an exception for you on this one. Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I appreciate that. Last quarter you guys indicated you were bringing down utilizations in the third quarter to try and reduce inventories. Looks like you guys executed to that. Should we anticipate gross margins in Q4 down in line with the lower utilizations in Q3? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Harlan, I'm not going to try to forecast individual lines of the P&L, but I'll just bring you back to what I had mentioned when John asked his question. We expect utilization to decline \u2013 pardon me, utilization to be about \u2013 excuse me, starts to be about even in fourth quarter versus third quarter, so we don't expect starts to actually change. The starts were already down third quarter versus second and third quarter versus a year-ago quarter, and we'll maintain those starts about even going into fourth quarter. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, okay. All right. Thank you. Yeah, and the other \u2013 certainly the other consideration with fourth quarter is what happens to revenue overall. So we'll have less revenue, so that'll impact gross margins. Okay. Thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks, guys. So if we look at just some sort of normal or reasonable projections for Q4, for 2015 your revenue's going be flat but your gross margins will be up and your OpEx will be down. If we assume the sort of bleah environment continues into 2016 and revenue is sort of whatever, around the flattish or something like that, is there any way that gross margins could go up and OpEx go down again? Can you just kind of take us through the puts and pulls for next year on those? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, I'll go ahead and take you through on those sort of things, Chris. First off, I'm hoping that you're wrong in your theory about revenue being flat again next year. Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Me, too. I want to keep my job. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : But under that scenario, I doubt that we'd see a whole lot of change in operating expenditures other than just normal annual pay and benefit increases. But on the margin side, on the gross margin side, we'd probably continue to see benefit as we see more and more of our production moving to 300 millimeter, which as you recall gives us about a 40% chip cost production from an overall cost of goods standpoint, so that will certainly benefit our gross margin line. In addition to that, we continue to see an expansion of revenue that's coming out of the industrial and automotive space as a percent of the total, and those tend to come through at higher gross margins, as well as just overall catalog products versus custom products inside our mix. And then the last item is that, as we talked about for a couple years now, our CapEx has been running under our depreciation by a couple of points, and that is slowly beginning to close. In fact, you can even see that gap closing just in this past 12-month comparison period. So as we look out into 2016, you'll see that gap close a bit more. So those in combination will give us continued tailwind on the gross margin line. Should fall all the way through to the operating margin. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, and I'd just add, too, that even with this year, if the revenue projections come in as you said, Chris, that our free cash flow margin continued to expand, and that's really what we're focused on. Do you have a follow-up, Chris? Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. So if we look at what revenue did sequentially in Q3 and what you're projecting for in Q4, it's pretty even with last year. So \u2013 and it sounds like even though business is still kind of bleah, it's getting a little bit better. Would you characterize the environment overall as kind of normal? And if it's not normal, then where would be your biggest area of concern or weakness? Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, Chris, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, it would suggest that our revenues would be down 2% from the year-ago. That's similar to the number that we just turned in, as well as what we saw in second quarter. So we just described the environment really hasn't changed very much. We just believe that we're operating in a weak macro environment. And we continue to focus on execution, and I think the business is showing the results of that focus and the strength of the business model. But, in general, that's really what we believe that we're operating in. So, okay. Thanks, Chris. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you had a 10% customer in the quarter or if you had any meaningful change in revenue from a single customer that would have affected the overall trend in the business during the quarter? Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, Will, when we had \u2013 if we look at last year, we had \u2013 our largest customer was 8% of revenue. And we don't give customer size by quarter, but we expect that that customer, as they've done well this year, that they could come in around 10% of our revenue. And I'd say this : As we look at that customer, we sell them hundreds of devices across multiple products. And if I contrasted that to the last time that we had a customer that was more than 10%, most of that revenue was concentrated in just a few parts and a single application. And even more specifically than that, it was really one function that maybe was that different generation. So we really just had one function at that customer. So even inside of this customer we've got quite a bit of diversity. Do you have a follow-on, Will? William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah, it's sort of related to this. The company exited the wireless apps processor and baseband business a few years ago. And I suppose the answer is around the concentration at the part number level, but does what looks like a growing exposure to the handset market through at least one but probably multiple customers \u2013 does that concern the company, the way that \u2013 in a similar way that caused you to exit some products previously? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, Will, I'd say that when you heard Dave's opening remarks that we saw growth in personal electronics and without that one customer growing, personal electronics would've been down, I think that's also telling us that as handsets overall grow, they're really becoming the larger piece of the personal electronics space. And so what's important is to have a lot of different chips that you're selling into, a lot of different customers who sell into that space, and that's exactly what we have. And so from that standpoint, if we're going to participate in personal electronics, you're going to be a \u2013 participating in handsets, and there are a lot of very attractive chip opportunities inside handsets, unlike what we had a number of years ago, as you remembered, with baseband and processors, where those parts were basically standardizing and commoditizing, and your ability to differentiate was diminished and therefore your ability to attract profits from selling those parts was diminished. And so consequently, I see this as quite a bit different today given the diversity of products that we're talking about here than the example of when we were baseband and processors five-plus years ago. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, and I'd add to that, if you look across personal electronics and you add smartphones and tablets and PCs and TVs and things like that, you're probably \u2013 if you added all those together, you're probably scaring (30:15) 2.4 billion, 2.5 billion units. And even though that unit pool probably isn't going to grow much, there's \u2013 as Kevin said, there's opportunities to find products that will live through multiple generations that you can sell to multiple customers and places where we'll continue to try to steer our investments overall. So thank you, Will, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Really two related questions. One, I just \u2013 a clarification. You said the upside in the quarter came from wireless infrastructure and industrial. It seems like HVAL was up a lot. Was that part of what you're calling industrial? And then maybe bigger picture, from a geographic perspective, there's obviously been some negative data points in kind of the U.S. industrial market. Just any change \u2013 over the summer it was China, now you're seeing some U.S. issues. Just any perspective from a geographic basis. Thanks. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Okay. So let me answer your first question, which if you look at HVAL, HVAL will have a high exposure to automotive, which will help drive those revenues. It'll also have exposure to personal electronics as well. It does have some industrial exposure, but I think that those are the areas that will drive that revenue. And you had a follow-up? Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: The question was just what you're seeing from a geographic perspective. Obviously China was weak \u2013 yeah. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, so \u2013 yeah, if I just look at our regional results year over year, revenue was down in Asia, in Europe, and U.S. In Japan, it was up. If you look at the broader China market, it really wasn't down differently than what the broader Asia was, and that was kind of down consistent with our overall revenue. So really didn't see much different. The second thing I'll add is that, a lot of times we're asked by investors what our exposure to China is or to a particular market, and in our 10-K we give a very precise number of what we ship into, China being 44%. But we always like to point out that if you're looking for what exposure to a particular market is, I think most investors are asking how much of our product is actually consumed there. And so it's a very different number than 44%. It's much lower than that, because obviously some of those products that we ship there end up getting shipped into other regions. I'll also point out that we may ship product into a Tier 2 OEM that gets put into a European automobile in Europe and then shipped into China. So you can't really look at any of our regional results and understand that. So \u2013 but overall, probably a good proxy to begin to start an analysis would be to look at what China is as a percentage of GDP, and kind of start an analysis from there. So, okay. Thank you, Blayne, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your customer inventories. You gave us the very helpful disti resale and inventory numbers, but just in general, you had a pretty good year in 2014, a weaker year this year, but my perception is that the customer inventory management, lead time, days held hasn't really changed. Can you just talk about whether you've seen any inflection there in the last few quarters? Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Sure, Joe. I'd say that of course the distribution inventories, as you said, that we can see very well, we've got 55% of our revenues that are on consignment. So for those portions, which will include 60% of our distributor revenue, but we know for that portion of our revenue there is no inventory, so it's actually zero. So obviously that's in really good shape. And if you look overall, the classic kind of booked/shipped carrying inventory type portion of our revenue is really about 20% of our revenue. And that's where we'll carry backlog, customers will have inventory. So we really don't see any signs that customer inventories are significantly out of whack. I'm sure you can always find pockets here and there. But we believe that they're fairly lean with very few exceptions, such as the wireless infrastructure. So do you have any follow-ons, Joe? Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, and I did want to follow up on wireless infrastructure. You said it was up sequentially, recovering from a lower level. Do you have visibility into whether that's sort of China deployments or Western deployments? And what do you see as the trajectory for that business going forward? Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, so, Joe, we have \u2013 I'd say that our exposure in wireless infrastructure, if you look at the major OEMs that make up the majority of that market, we'll have a different product exposure, but a fairly consistent exposure across them. So if there's demand in any of the regions, we'll typically participate in that. If you look at by technology \u2013 that's oftentimes another cut that people will look at \u2013 we've got a strong position in 3G, a slightly stronger position in 4G. And even in newer areas that we expect growth in the future that we've been investing in, as an example like small cells, we've been investing and believe we'll have a very strong position there as well. So our numbers aren't so much impacted by a specific region. Of course, we won't escape it either if there's weakness in any particular region. So, okay. Thank you, Joe. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Congrats on the strong results. I know in the past, Dave, you gave the year-over-years. I think you mentioned that the wireless infrastructure sequentially was up. I was hoping you could give the sequential direction by the other markets, and I think from the math you gave earlier, for last year, by the end markets, it seemed to imply that the combination of industrial and your comm infrastructure, your wireless infrastructure, must have been up the better part of 15% sequentially. So if you could just comment on the directional color by segment and if those magnitudes are anywhere close, that would be helpful. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Okay. Yeah, so I can share with you some color sequentially. The automotive market grew sequentially, led by our ADAS and infotainment sectors. Industrial, again, was about even. And personal electronics was up, with growth in most of the sectors that make up that market. Communications equipment was, up as we talked about earlier, due to wireless infrastructure. And enterprise systems was about even. So \u2013 and, as we talked about, most of those areas were stronger than we had expected, but specifically wireless infrastructure and industrial. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, just on the year-over-year growth, though, I'm not sure, Ross, on the numbers you were reciting there, but industrial overall year over year was probably only up about 1%. And then wireless - Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, I'm sorry. I was talking sequentially. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Okay. Yeah, because wireless infrastructure is still down year over year. Sequential industrial was actually down about 1% overall. And then wireless infrastructure was, again, up in single digits. So really not much growth there. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah. Okay. And do you have a follow-up, Ross? Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, just a quick one, more housekeeping. I know you're not going to give exact guidance on the gross margin you said earlier, but as far as OpEx directionally in the fourth quarter and first quarter, I know you guys tend to have some year-end phenomenons that impact that. So, Kevin, any sort of color on those two quarters would be helpful. Thanks. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, Ross, it's going to be pretty normal to what you've seen in past quarters. Your memory is quite correct on that. 4Q is typically down low to mid-single digits percentage-wise, just because of seasonality of holidays around Thanksgiving and Christmas. And then first quarter is typically up in a reverse direction. Again, because of the absence of holidays and also because of the implementation of our annual pay and benefits increases. So I think that if you look at the past couple of years, 3Q to 4Q to 1Q, that's probably the best proxy for you to try to model into your spreadsheets for now. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, okay. Thank you, Ross. And we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open. Erik Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. This is Erik calling in for Tore. A lot of questions have been asked, but going back to the 300-millimeter strategy, can you give us an update on that exiting the year, maybe how much of Analog would you expect to be coming out of the fabs to support that? Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Hey, Erik. I'll just say that we'll give an update to that in our February capital management call. I can just say that part of our plan was to qualify our DMOS6 factory, so that qualification is planned to be done before the end of the year. And so we're still tracking to that. And we've been releasing products to RFAB, or the Richardson fab, for some time, so we're going to continue to do that. And we still have quite a bit of capacity to be able to grow into. So do you have a follow-on? Erik Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, no, thank you. That's helpful. The Embedded Processing, obviously the operating margins looked very good this quarter. Going forward \u2013 and I know you probably don't want to give too much guidance on this \u2013 but what are the expectations for this business? Will it be lumpy in terms of the improvements? Was this a little bit more of an outsized quarter in terms of the improvement, or should we see \u2013 what are some of the expectations for that group? Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, Erik, I'll just tell you, that team's been working pretty hard for a number of years now to grow their revenue. We've talked about their mission over the last couple of years has really been cost containment and growing the revenue, and they are achieving very good results on that now. Importantly, they're a strong contributor to our free cash flow growth. And just as our free cash flow at the company level tends to be weaker in the first couple quarters and stronger in the second couple of quarters, I don't think it's any different than when we take a look at how some of the business units underneath will perform on that metric, being as they're the ones contributing to that free cash flow. We tend to look at these things over a longer period of times, because quarter to quarter can be pretty noisy. But I think that team has done a very good job of getting its margins up to where we think its entitlement is at, and they should be performing at that level for the foreseeable future \u2013 in fact the long term is what we expect out of them. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah. And I'll just add that, as Kevin mentioned, the growth has been coming through from the investments that we've made. We highlighted that they, as well as Analog, had achieved record levels of revenue as a result of those investments. Together Analog and Embedded have grown for nine quarters in a row year over year. So \u2013 and I think there was one quarter where Embedded actually did well but didn't grow year over year, and that was last quarter that had the big headwind from wireless infrastructure. But the other parts of that business obviously did very well. Okay. I think we have time for one last caller. Operator? Operator : And we'll take our last question from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Just a detail of your earlier answer. You noted personal electronics was up because of demand from one customer. What about your broader segments? Would you still have seen year-over-year growth in both Analog and Embedded if it hadn't been for that same one customer? Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, I actually don't have that data broken out between the two segments, but I think that personal electronics is mostly inside of Analog. And so our personal electronics business without that customer obviously wasn't up. So that would have impacted Analog. Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Well, let me remind you the other side of that, too, in that we had a significant change in foreign exchange rates at the beginning of (44:03) the year. And so actually in the third quarter, and I think again in the fourth quarter, we saw and expected about a $35 million negative top line impact due to foreign exchange rates. So we can always pick out individual pieces. The beauty of the TI model is that we have tens of thousands of customers buying tens of thousands of parts into almost every electrical and electronic market that's out there, and the diversity is what is really paying off for shareholders in free cash flow generation. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : That's good - David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : And I guess you don't have follow-up, David? David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Well, actually one quick one. As you move more to 300 millimeters, are you vacating any specific 200-millimeter facilities you might be able to close down or sell eventually? Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, David, we've put in place that 300-millimeter capacity in the Richardson fab and put together the plans inside of DMOS6, the second 300-millimeter factory, to be able to support growth. That's why that's there. It's really releasing new products into those factories. And that's what they're there for, and that'll help us maximize free cash flow. Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations : So, okay, well, thank you, David, and thank you all for joining us. I was expecting Marty McFly to actually get in the queue, but he didn't. So a replay of this call is available, and you can find it on our new and improved website. Good evening. Operator : This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect. Thank you, and have a great evening.",

At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2015 and 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call on February 9 at 10 a.m. Central Time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done in the past, Kevin March and I will provide insight into our strategy and we'll also answer some of the most frequently asked questions. Now, I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago and was in line with our expectations, even though we experienced slowing demand within a sector of the personal electronics market late in the quarter. Despite that, overall demand was about as expected. I'll elaborate in a few moments. Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing performed well in the quarter and comprised 87% of fourth quarter revenue. Earnings per share were $0.80 in the quarter and included a $0.09 benefit for two items that were not in our outlook. These two items were a $0.05 net tax benefit and $0.04 for restructuring charges, other. With that backdrop, let me move into the details of our performance, which even in the face of weaker demand within the sector of personal electronics market, continues to illustrate the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.7 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up from 26.9% a year ago, and consistent with our target range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the breadth and differentiation of our product portfolio and from the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. In 2015, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. Turning to our segments, Analog revenue decreased 2% from a year-ago quarter. Power management, high performance analog and Silicon Valley Analog declined while high volume analog and logic grew. Embedded Processing revenue increased 4% from year-ago quarter due to connectivity and microcontrollers. Processors declined. In our Other segment, revenue declined 13% from year-ago quarter due to custom ASIC and DLP products. Compared with the year-ago quarter, distribution resales decreased by 2%. Distributor inventory decreased about 1 day compared with a year ago to just above 4 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times. Together, these continue to drive high customer service metrics. For the year in total, Analog and Embedded revenue grew a combined 3% despite significant headwinds in wireless infrastructure and foreign currency exchange rates. Analog was up 3% and Embedded was up 2%. In total, Analog and Embedded were 86% of TI's revenue for the year, up from 83% in 2014. Based on data through November, we gained market share in Analog for the sixth consecutive year, and held our share gains in Embedded Processing. I'll turn now to our end market estimates for 2015. As a reminder, we provide this estimate annually of TI's revenue by the end markets our customers sell into. We break this into six categories : industrial; automotive; personal electronics, where this will include products such as PCs, phones and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators and royalties. Industrial and automotive combined were 46% of TI's revenue, up a couple of percentage points from last year due to automotive strength. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue, automotive 15%, personal electronics 30%, communications equipment 13%, enterprise systems 6% and other 5%. Of note, Apple, whose revenue is within personal electronics market, contributed approximately 11% of our revenue in 2015. Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.87 billion, a decline of 2% versus a year ago due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. As a percent of revenue, gross profit set a new record of 58.5%. Operating expenses for the quarter totaled $711 million, down $29 million from a year ago, primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan, partially offset by higher compensation-related costs. Acquisition charges were $81 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Restructuring charges other was $68 million, which included gains on sales of two properties. It also included a $17 million charge in preparation for the closure of a site, which we announced today in our earnings release. We anticipate about $2 million of quarterly charges through the fourth quarter of 2018 for a total charge of about $40 million. We expect the transition to more cost-effective 200 millimeter fabs to take about three years and result in annualized savings of about $35 million per year. Operating profit was $1.14 billion, or 35.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 4% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 38.0%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 23.4%, 6 percentage points higher than a year ago as we continue to focus investments on our best growth opportunities. Net income in the fourth quarter was $836 million, or $0.80 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 net tax benefit primarily due to the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit, and a net benefit of $0.04 from restructuring other charges. I'll now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.43 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 115, up 4 days sequentially and down 2 days from a year ago. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model in our capital management call on Tuesday, February 9. Capital expenditures were $164 million in the quarter. In 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.27 billion, up 10% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $551 million, or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300 millimeter analog capacity, on which we will provide an update in our capital management call in February. Free cash flow for the year was $3.72 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up 170 basis points from a year ago. Our free cash flow growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercise of equity compensation minus any net debt retirement. In the fourth quarter, TI paid $386 million in dividends and repurchased $627 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in 2015 was $4.19 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.4% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004, when we initiated our repurchase program designed to reduce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices, which are designed to make cash available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.22 billion of cash and short-term investments, with 82% of that cash onshore, making it available to return to shareholders. TI orders in the quarter were $3.10 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.85 billion to $3.09 billion in the first quarter. This includes significantly weaker demand within the sector of the personal electronics market. Specifically, we expect a year-over-year decline of about $150 million within the sector of our personal electronics revenue. Except for this area of weakness, our expectations for the remainder of our business are about even with the year-ago quarter. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30% and this is the tax rate that you should use for the first quarter and for the year. In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2015 was slower than we expected when we came into the year. However, our unique advantages in manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach, and our diverse and long-lived product positions enabled important milestones in the year. These included expansion of 300 millimeter analog production, gross margin improvement of 130 basis points to a new record level, operating margin improvements of 260 basis points, and free cash flow margin improvement of 170 basis points to a new record level. We will continue to feed our unique advantages through disciplined capital allocation and focus on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And we'll go to our first question from Chris Danely with Citi. Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey thanks, guys. Can you just divulge to us the market on personal electronics that is causing all the weakness? And if it is handsets, which probably doesn't come as a huge surprise. Maybe also comment on the other end markets, especially PCs where some of the other semiconductor companies have talked about a little bit of weakening in PCs and what you guys are seeing in that end market. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Okay, Chris. The sector where we saw the weaknesses you were guessing is mobile phones and we did see that sector weaken late in the quarter, in the back half of the month of December. If I just take and look at for the year how our end markets did, I'll put that into perspective. I'll start with an area of strength in automotive. That grew in the mid teens. Most of the sectors inside of that growing, growing double-digits. Industrial revenue was about even for the year and we had about half of the sectors there were increasing, offset by the others. Personal electronics, as we've just talked about, grew single-digits. I'll note that we had certainly growth in one customer that grew significantly that year, but that was primarily offset by declines in others. So therefore our percentage of our revenue in personal electronics really didn't change too much. It went from 29% last year to 30% this year. Communications equipment was down 20%. And that was primarily driven by wireless infrastructure and that was down around 30% for the year. And then finally, enterprise systems was down slightly due to projectors. So with that said, Chris, I think as we talked about earlier in our prepared remarks, outside of that one area of weakness, everything else came in about as we had expected. So that would be inclusive of PCs and the other areas that you talked about. You have a follow on? Operator : We'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Okay, Chris, if you have \u2013 go ahead, John. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah thanks, guys. Just to follow up, you talked about Apple being an 11% customer for the full year. I'm wondering if you could talk about the linearity of that percentage as the year progressed. Did they exit the year as a larger customer? And as you think about the weakness in Q1 in smartphones, do you feel like you're at a build level that's significantly below sell-through so Q1 will represent a bottom in that weakness? Or how do you handicap that? David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, so our revenue profile inside of personal electronics obviously will be more back half-weighted. As that customer did well in the marketplace, obviously our revenues would be reflective of that. I could point out that we sell very diverse set of products to that customer and in fact, hundreds of products to it and products in every major platform. That said, I think that the revenues of that customer reported to be somewhere around two-thirds of it is in smartphones, and you'd expect, since we've got a pretty diverse position across the customer, our revenues would be very similar. So, and certainly, I think that whenever you have a fairly significant change in demand of any customer, their supply chain considerations where you've got different pieces of inventory sitting inside of that supply chain, we happen to be on the beginning part of that supply chain. So I won't try to handicap where that is. That's where we think the demand will come in in first quarter and we'll see. We'll make a prediction on second quarter later. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Yeah, I might just add on that demand profile. We did discuss that we expect about $150 million year-over-year decline attributable to this particular sector in personal electronics. The rest will be about even with last year. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Right, good point. John, do you have a follow-up? John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, Kevin, just to follow-up on that. With the rest of the business even from last year, there's clearly a lot of investor angst about the macro in general. And clearly, if you look at your business profile throughout 2015 and excluded Apple, you saw some weakness in the rest of your business starting in the June quarter. You'd had a couple of quarters of year-over-year declines in total revenue, even as personal electronics has done strongly. And so when you look at the macro concerns that are out there, do you feel like that that's been fully reflected in the June, September, December numbers, and that you're now coming out of this? Or how do you handicap our macro concerns onto your forward-looking guidance? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: John, I think that at the highest level, we think we're continuing to operate in a relatively weak macro economy as we have been for the last couple of years. So nothing terribly exciting in the economy as a whole. If we kind of look at the comparison we're talking about, recall that a year ago, we were seeing sharp declines occurring in communications infrastructure and we're also seeing some pretty stiff headwinds in the form of foreign exchange where if the rate of exchange moving against us from the US dollar strength standpoint. So despite that, when you take a look at all that, we actually see aside from this one sector of personal electronics, the balance of it's going to be about even on a year-over-year basis. So again, the headlines that we're seeing on the macro front and a lot of the angst that you mentioned certainly sounds real, but actually from a demand signal standpoint from our customers, it's consistent with what I just said. We continue to operate in a weak macro environment, with lots of cross currents going on. Again, last year's weakening in comms infrastructure, very strong auto, foreign exchange issues that we were dealing with. This year, we don't see where those things are coming into play right now. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, and I'll just add that I think that inside of that weak macro economy, just the diversity of our products and the business model, we continue to operate extremely well inside of that environment. Thank you, John, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Danely. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Hey, Chris. Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for letting me ask the follow up. I thought you had something against short people. Just a quick one, so Kevin, as you mentioned, it's kind of a flat environment. You still managed to grow earnings 8% in 2015. So in 2016, if things are flat to down, maybe talk about some of the leverage you guys have or would pull to try and keep earnings flat or could we see earnings be down again? Or excuse me, be down in this year. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Yeah, there's a lot of assumptions inside there, Chris. But let me just remind you as to the moving parts that are going on here. And you can spot it if you take a look at the release that we just put out there. I think the most apparent number you can see on there is the decline in depreciation beginning to occur. And clearly, just from an accounting standpoint, that increases our gross profit margin and falls through to EPS. That depreciation will continue its glide path down in 2016, consistent with the fact that a lot of those purchases that we made five years ago are now reaching the end of their depreciable life. In addition to that, we're seeing a growing portion of our chips being produced in our 300 millimeter capacity and as you know, it costs us about 40% less per chip, or about 20% less per device to manufacture on 300 millimeter versus 200 millimeter. So as that mix improves, that will also fall through to the bottom line. And then the third element that I'd just point out is that we continue to see a mix shift in the source of revenue into industrial and automotive which tend to have higher overall margins and certainly stickier revenue margin profiles over time. So collectively, those should help our overall margin and earnings performance, notwithstanding whatever direction revenue takes us through over the next 12 months. In addition to that, from an EPS standpoint, as we have been doing for eleven years now, as long as the intrinsic value of the company is higher than the market value, we will continue to be buyers of TI shares. We reduced our share count 3.4% this past year. And certainly at current prices, it says we should continue to be active accumulators of TI shares. So combined, we certainly would have momentum in our favor, notwithstanding a significant change in our revenue profile to continue to help us with earnings per share. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Right, okay. Thanks so much, Chris. I'm sorry about the difficulty there. And operator, we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Kevin, why don't we just continue with the topic you talked about as far as earnings drivers. The OpEx continues to impress. I think for the second year in a row OpEx dropped by 5%. And I know you had some specific closures in Japan, et cetera. If we were to look forward on OpEx, are there any unique drivers, such as closing businesses that are really going to impact that? Or how should we think about OpEx relative to sales? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Yeah, Ross, I guess the way I'd answer that is that there are no nobs on the horizon right now of any measure that were similar to what you've seen in the last couple of years. As you pointed out, we had some restructuring actions that we took in Japan, and also in certain parts of Embedded Processing over the last two years, and those have removed quite a bit of OpEx cost. And those are about done now. They pretty much finished up in the middle of last year. As we look forward, what we would expect to see is what we've talked about in the past, that our OpEx should operate somewhere between 20% and 30% of revenue. In a weak market, it might be pushing 30%. In a reasonably strong markets, it might be pushing 20%. I think we're in the low 20s right now, 23% for 2015. So again as I look forward, I don't see any real material changes to the OpEx profile. I will just remind you that we do always have a seasonal pattern in our OpEx, just like OpEx was down 3Q to 4Q because of holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, OpEx will be up again in 1Q versus 4Q because of the absence of those holidays, and also the annual pay and benefits increases that we instituted across the company in the first quarter. And just to kind of give you some parameters on that, it's probably in the 4% to 5% range increase, 4Q to 1Q on OpEx. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Any comment on that? Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I do. On the communications equipment side of things, you mentioned it was down about 20%. That's not a huge surprise. You mentioned the wireless cause of that. Can you talk a little bit about what that segment did sequentially in the December quarter and what sort of outlook do you have for it heading into 2016? David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, I think, if you look at that sequentially, it was down around mid teens, but from a year ago, it was down mid teens, but actually did see some growth. That was the second quarter in a row that we had growth inside of there. So I think that business continues to be one that over the last couple of decades has been very, very choppy. That characteristic probable won't change. But we're on a position where we've got a couple of quarters of growth. I think that when we look at it longer term, we do believe that carrier CapEx won't grow. It certainly won't drop to zero either. But we do think that it will get smaller slightly in time. Okay thanks, Ross. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you for taking my question. So last year you expanded gross margins by about 120 basis points, which is very impressive given the flat, the macro environment. But if I had asked you a year ago where would gross margins go given all the levers, right, because it moved from 200 to 300 millimeter, the lower depreciation, the mix shift towards industrial and automotive, do you think you would have thought gross margins would be even stronger than right, what you might have than what you actually achieved? So my question really is that as we look forward, what is a bigger driver of gross margins? Is it top line growth and wafer starts or do you still think that 200 to 300 millimeter, that move is being underappreciated in terms of a gross margin driver? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Okay. First off, let me just make sure we've got the scorekeeping going on correctly here. I think we're talking about 130 basis points of improvement this past year. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sorry, yes, 130. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Don't want to miss out on that extra 10 there. As I look into 2015, clearly any meaningful revenue growth will incrementally have a much stronger impact than any other piece of the P&L on improving overall gross margins. But independent of margin growth, I'd go back to what I talked about a few minutes ago on Ross's question, and that would be really the increasing mix improvement on 300 millimeter, the mix to industrial and auto and then just the decline in depreciation as we continue to march through 2016. It's pretty tough to handicap which one would be the biggest contributor, or how to sequence those. But I think that they will all collectively be quite meaningful as we move into 2016 and I think we'll probably pleasantly please ourselves again for another year. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, and I'll just add to that, Vivek, that on essentially flat revenues, all of that came down to free cash flow growing by 6%, right. So there's some things going on with accounting rules of on the gross margin line, but really we're focused on growing that gross margin, or on the free cash flow growth specifically and it clocked in pretty nicely as well. So you have a follow on? Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, thanks Dave. The question is on your Other segment where you have the DLP and calculators and ASICs. So that was down about 14% if I ignore the legacy wireless piece. Why was it down so much and how should we think about that segment in 2016? Thank you. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Sure. And if you look for the year, it was down, I'm not sure if your question was for the year or for the quarter. It's actually the same reason. It's down primarily due to custom ASIC products. If you remember, those products have a very high exposure to wireless infrastructure and that's where we saw the headwind. It was also down because DLP, and DLP had a very good year in 2014, so very, very difficult compare on that front. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Good year because there was a strong World Cup demand pulling through DLP. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And how to think about it for 2016? David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, so I think that if you look, last year was in the mid teens. If you go back several years, it's actually been in that same range. Previous years were primarily driven from the exit of the wireless business. But as we go into next year and as we look, essentially that we've got some long-term growth potentials inside of DLP. I think calculators have been flat to slightly down and we would continue to expect to see that. Growth in royalties, royalties have been about 1% of our revenue and we'd expect them to continue to run in that area. And then we've got ASIC that will shift over time into our Embedded Processing as we pick up that functionality. So we'd expect that mid teens to slow somewhere in the mid to low single digit declines going forward. Okay. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go ahead and move on to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll go next to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the strength in your Embedded segment in December, you also had a good growth in the September quarter as well. I'm focused on the MCU products here. Can you just help us understand what are the end markets and trends that have been driving the strength here in the MCU biz? I'm assuming most of it was auto and industrial, but love to get your insights. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, so I think when you look at the Embedded sector, if I look for the year, the increase was due to connectivity and microcontrollers. And both of those product lines I would say have a very diverse customer footprint, and so there's really not one sector or market that's driving it. Collectively, you're right. It's in industrial as well as automotive, but probably has a bias to industrial, just because of the diversity of those customers and where they're winning designs. So very, very broad based, and that's part of the reason why we're encouraged with that business and the growth. And I think that also you see how that contributes to the bottom line and the profitability of that sector, or that business for the year. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for that color. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Have a follow-on, Harlan? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. On your broad catalog analog business, it's a high gross margin business. I think the team has done a good job of continuing to improve the breadth and the access to the portfolio. So I guess the question is did the catalog business outgrow the overall Analog business in 2015 and do you expect it to outperform overall Analog this year as well? David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, so we don't really have our business so much lined up by catalog or not. I'd say that the majority of the products by number certainly are more catalog-based as we've got tens of thousands of products. But we're not quite organized that way. I mean we've got the four businesses of the high volume analog and logic, which will be more application-specific products. And even there, even though they're application-specific, many of those products are available to multiple customers and even sometimes multiple markets, even though they're application-specific. Something like motor drivers, as an example, sell into multiple markets and multiple sectors. We got power and then high performance analog and SVA. So we just don't have a cut between that. Okay, thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to our next caller, please. Operator : We'll go next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, thank you very much. Dave and Kevin, I wanted to go back to the overall environment, and in the past you guys have been very good about giving us essentially sign post metrics. Dave, I think if I remember correctly, rate of cancellations and a few others. Could you please remind us what those metrics are telling you about the overall health of TI's business? And then I had a quick follow up. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Sure. I think, Ambrish, as we just look at our business and as Kevin mentioned before, we believe that we've been operating in a weaker environment and that that will continue from some time. We've had some people ask us if we think a semiconductor cycle is underlying what we're seeing and we just haven't seen those signs of a traditional cycle. So there are things like our lead times continue to remain short. Our cancellations remain very low. Our distribution inventory continues to hold around 4 weeks. And we continue to deliver our products on time to our customers when they're asking at very, very high service levels. So those are some of the bigger ones that come to mind, that you would see some movement if you were moving through a bottom or a top of the cycle, and we just haven't seen that in quite some time. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Makes sense, Dave. And then my follow up was on the industrial segment. And obviously I don't pay attention to the quarter-quarter, but on a full-year basis, if I recall what the number you gave us, it's flat for the year. And the year before that, it was up 10%. So given it's such a cornerstone of your business, also your gross margin expansion, how do you explain the flat year-over-year last year and then what do you think industrial should do in 2016? Thank you, Dave. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Sure, yeah. And before I talk about industrial, I just want to remind those that may not be as familiar with us, when we talk about our industrial market, it's something that's very broad and different than what a typical investor would look from an industrial screen. So we've got 14 sectors that makes up industrial and they'll include things like factory automation, medical and healthcare, building automation, grid infrastructure, test measurement, motor drives, electronic point of sale, space and avionics, display power delivery, appliances, lighting, industrial transportation and then a bucket of everything else that goes into it. So slightly or very different than what most people would think of in industrials. And you're right, it had a strong year the year before. I think when we started the year, we had expected it to be stronger than what it turned out. And typically a lot of people ask us, hey, we hear the rumors in China. We see the stocks that they follow maybe in the industrial segment are seeing very, very, very weak demand. But we turned in revenue that was consistent with what we saw after a very strong year. And fundamentally what we think's going on inside of that is that there's more semiconductor content going into the industrial market and we think we're in the very early stages of that. And if you look at the automotive market, I think it's much easier to see that content because we know how many cars ship per year. It's much easier to see the difference between total SAAR unit growth and what the semiconductors are shipping into it. Certainly impossible to be able to see inside of the industrial market because it's very, very broad and very, very diverse. But that said, we believe that we've got a decade or more of runway of increasing content inside of the industrial market. So that's about all the insight I think I can share on that. Okay thank you, Ambrish, and we'll go on to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Rolland with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey guys, thanks for the question and excuse me if this has already been asked. If you could give us a little bit more detail on the Scottish fab and what was being made there and how large was that footprint, and then also, what kind of OpEx opportunities you might have there. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Chris, the fab in Greenock, Scotland, is one that came to us with the acquisition of National Semiconductor in 2011. Most of the parts that are manufactured in there are part of our Silicon Valley Analog business. We announced today that we are going to, I think we're putting together plans to wind down operations there and move the production to other 200 millimeter fabs that we have in Germany, Japan and Maine in the US. These are larger, more cost effective, more technologically advanced factories that can just give us a lot better economics with those chips that are produced there. It will take us about three years to wind down those operations by our estimate right now, as it takes just that much time to requalify those parts into other factories. And at the end of that period, we will no longer have an operation in Greenock. We took a $17 million charge in the quarter as we began planning for that activity and we expect that we'll probably continue to incur roughly $2 million of charges per quarter each quarter through the end of 2018 as we wind it down, for total charges of about $40 million over a three year period. Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Great, one more follow-up there. Why not any opportunities to move to 300 millimeter? And then also as we look at Embedded, I think we concentrated a little bit on MCUs, but maybe we can talk about connectivity and why that was up year-over-year. And does the growth in MCU year-on-year at all change your penchant in M&A towards Embedded versus your favorite Analog? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Dave and I are going to have to tag team that one. I'll finish off the Scottish fab one, the why not 300 millimeter. Short answer is most of those processes are dual qualed already in other 200 millimeter factories and it's just a whole lot easier to transfer into a qualified process already existing in other factories. Not all, but enough of them. And so consequently, we'll just go ahead and put those into open capacity in 200 millimeter factories versus bringing them into 300. And Dave, you want to take the? David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, Chris, your question on connectivity, what's driving the growth there. There we've got a very broad portfolio of products we support, about a dozen different standards from a connectivity standpoint, so low power Bluetooth to Wi-Fi to other sub-gigahertz standards. And so if somebody wants to connect something, we have a solution that we can offer them. And so we're just seeing really good uptake of the products that we've got there. I think you rolled in a question about does it change our penchant for acquisition. Again our belief is that when you acquire a company in the Embedded space, you're picking up additional architectures and additional architectures doesn't make you stronger, it just makes you bigger. And so we'll continue to look for companies that have characteristics much like a National does. If we, when we are interested and that's the profile of the type of company. Let me just add, too, on the Greenock facility that we do expect to save about $35 million once we've completed all the transition. That's on an annualized basis, and once we do complete the transition of the products to the more cost-effective fabs. Okay. Thanks, Chris, and we'll move on to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question, and I wanted to ask a follow-up on some of the 300 millimeter points that were made. Kevin, can you help me understand where in the portfolio on a segment and sub-segment basis the company is having the most success with the 300 millimeter transition and therefore, what's left to go? And as you look at the opportunity, is it a fairly steady opportunity or are there some discontinuities hemming in your ability to move product over to 300? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Well, Craig, I'd say the benefit is really happening right now in the Analog portfolio, and it's happened across all four of the business units inside Analog. Because of it, 300 millimeter factor we have in our fab being highly automated, somewhat counterintuitively you don't have to have really high-volume parts running through there, because the automation we can actually run relatively low-volume parts through there and still gain significant cost benefit. So what, the way we've been employing the 300 millimeter strategy is not so much to re-qual existing 200 into that factory, but instead to release new products into that factory on already qualified processes. And that's really the focus that we've had and it will continue going forward. And we'll give a further update as to our progress to date on both the runner (42:57) fab as well as the DMOS6 fab that we're converting that we announced last year, coming on February 9 on our capital management call. So stay tuned for that. We'll give a new update on that as well. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thank you, and then switching gears just on the competitive front. A couple of competitors in the MCU business have recently announced that they'll be getting together. Thoughts on the implications for your ability to continue to grow and take operating margins in Embedded from the mid 20s higher if there's a more consolidated landscape out there. Thank you. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Yeah. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Yeah, go ahead, Dave. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : I was just going to say that we've obviously competed with both of those companies for a couple of decades and them combining together really doesn't change much from a competitive landscape. And we believe that our four competitive attributes that make us unique, they're hard to replicate. We'll stay focused on those and those are our approach to manufacturing, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of the market channels that we've got and our diverse and long-lived positions. And that's what we'll stay focused on those, and we think those have helped us gain share and they'll help us continue to gain share. Okay. We've got time for one more caller, please. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Freedman with Sterne Agee. Doug Freedman - Sterne Agee CRT : Great, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess if I could focus in on the fact that you did report Apple as a 11% customer. Can you maybe talk about your expectations for the full year in terms of content? You did mention you're in many different devices, but on a like for like device there, do you believe that you're holding content, increasing content? Any guidance you can give us and maybe how we should think about that being seasonally, the impacts on that seasonality. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, Doug, we just won't provide color at that level on a specific customer. I just, overall, I think if you look at how Apple has impacted our business with their success in the marketplace, personal electronics was about 30% of revenue in 2015. If you look at the market overall, I think if you take memory out, personal electronics is probably around 60% of the market. And so we have about half of the exposure there. So we try to find places where we've got some differentiation where we believe that those products will last more than one cycle. Perhaps they're products that we developed that we can use in other customers or even in other markets in some cases. So that's really what we'll stay focused on overall. So do you have a follow-on question? Doug Freedman - Sterne Agee CRT : I do. It's actually probably for Kevin. Looking at, you mentioned depreciation ramping down. Can you give us a sense of how quickly? I've got you running at about a $688 million rate for the year, but your CapEx I believe around $500 million. How quickly should we see those numbers merge together? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Yeah, I don't think you're going to see CapEx and depreciation cross over before the end of 2016. Depreciation will continue to run down during 2016. And really the kind of gentle rollover you saw begin to occur in 2015 is your best proxy for how to model 2016. David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Doug, and thank you all for joining us. Again, please plan to join us for our capital management call on February 9 at 10 :00 a.m. Central Time. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web as well. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the quarter was in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with the year ago, notable market activity for our products included continuing strength in automotive as well as improvement in the industrial and communications equipment. Revenue was down 5% due to the weakness in personal electronics market, which declined as expected. Our core businesses of analog and embedded processing comprised 87% of first quarter revenue. Analog revenue declined 8%, while embedded processing revenue grew 8%.  Earnings per share were $0.65. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $547 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.7 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.4% of revenue, up from 27.3% a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to our investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Analog revenue decreased 8% from a year ago. The decline was primarily due to high volume, analog and logic. Power management and high-performance analog also declined, while Silicon Valley analog grew. Embedded processing revenue increased 8% from a year ago due to growth in all three product lines, led by processors. Our investments in embedded are translating into tangible results as this quarter's revenue is a record. In our other segment, revenue declined 10% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products. Compared with a year ago, distributor resales decreased 4% due to lower demand and personal electronics that I described earlier. Inventory increased a couple of days to about 4-1/2 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which, together, drive high customer service metric. As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program. Now provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end-market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained very strong driven by infotainment and hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain systems. Industrial demand strengthened broadly with most sectors growing. Within personal electronics, we had a portion of demand that declined about $150 million as expected. Overall personal electronics was down more than that, primarily due to mobile phones. Communications equipment was about even from a year ago, an improvement from last quarter when it was down about 15%. And finally, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies able to -- capable of long-term free cash flow growth. Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Kevin March : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion and was 60.6% of revenue, a new record. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 290 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, as well as a higher percentage of more profitable products. Operating expenses were $774 million, about even with the year-ago period. Over the last 12 months we've invested $1.27 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were for the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Operating profit was $968 million or 32.2% of revenue. Operating profit was up 1% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 36.1%. Operating margin for embedded processing was 25.0%, 670 basis points higher than a year ago, as we focused our investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions. Net income in the first quarter was $668 million or $0.65 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $547 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 137, as we staged our inventory for increased shipments in the second quarter. Also included were three to four days of inventory associated with a portion of the personal electronics market that started to flow late in the fourth quarter. We expect to ship this material later this year. Capital expenditures were $124 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.21 billion, up 4% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $552 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which include the expansion of our 300-millimeter analog capacity. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.65 billion or 28.4% of revenue. Free cash flow was 1% higher than a year ago. This growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only for this return to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercise of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement. In the first quarter we paid $383 million in dividends and repurchased $630 million of our stock for a total of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.17 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.6% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to produce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $2.80 billion of cash and short-term investments with our US entities owning the 80% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.09 billion, down 4% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, for the second quarter we expect revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.77. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter to the third quarter of 2019. They'll then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year. So in summary, we believe our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. And with that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for additional follow-up. Erica [ph]? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to the line of Romit Shah. Please go ahead. Romit Shah - Nomura: Yes, thank you, and excellent results. Could you give us a little bit more color on what's driving the revenues in Q2 by end-market? Dave Pahl : Yeah, Romit. We don't typically provide a forecast by end-market. However, if there's any large shifts, we'll talk about that, you know, much like we did last quarter within a sector in personal electronics. I can say that that demand we would expect to grow sequentially, but it will be down significantly from a year ago. And I'd also say that, outside of that, we would expect the rest of our business to grow both sequentially and year over year. Romit Shah - Nomura: Okay. And yeah, just -- yeah, I know that the conversation to 300-millimeter has been an important part of the improvement in margin profile, and I was wondering if you could just update us on how much of the portfolio is converted to 300 and how much is left. Kevin March : Romit, I'll go ahead and talk to that. Roughly a quarter of our analog revenue was generated on 300 millimeter last year. We have total internal capability about $8 billion, so we're using about a quarter of that capability at this point in time. Just to remind everyone else who's listening, the reason the 300 millimeter is so important to us is really the economics at the factory level. We get about 2.3 times as many chips per wafer on a 300 millimeter versus the 200 millimeter. The wafer processing cost is about 1.4 times as much. So if you do the math, that means the actual die cost is only about 60% as much on a 300 millimeter as a 200 millimeter wafer. When you kind of take that all the way through to finished goods, all things being equal we wind up with a higher gross margin on those chips to manufacture 300 millimeter. So that's increasingly important to us. As we look out in the future, again we've got about probably $6 billion of growth capacity in 300 millimeter and we continue to increase our loadings in that space. In fact on a year-over-year basis we actually had more starts on 300 millimeter than a year ago. Dave Pahl : Good. And I'll just add to Kevin's comment, that as we reported last quarter, we qualified our second 300 millimeter fab, which is DMOS 6, and we do have product running in that fab today. So, thank you, Romit. We'll go to the next caller please. Operator : I'll take our next question from the line of John Pitzer. Please go ahead, your line is open. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse : Yeah, good afternoon guys. Solid execution as always. I guess, could you talk a little bit about the embedded processing op margin improvements? If memory serves me correct, when you got out of the wireless business, you didn't get out of all the costs and you put a lot of that cost into the embedded processing market. If I look at sort of the incremental margin, op margin sequentially, it's greater than 60%. Are we sort of at a tipping point here with that kind of the incremental op margin we should start to see about this business? And is there any reason why the embedded op margin shouldn't converge with the analog op margins over time? Kevin March : Yeah, John. You might recall was for the year ago we were still in the process of winding up some restructuring items in the embedded processing segment. That finished about the middle of the second quarter, that bled over into the middle of the second quarter. [Inaudible] now we're seeing the benefit of those cost restructurings. The margin improvement that we'll see [inaudible] solid 25% operating profit a quarter, and that's really much closer to what we expect from that business segment. As you noted, we had about, quarter over quarter, about a 62% pull-through [ph] to operating profit from the revenue growth. And as we go forward, the focus of that division will be primarily on very solid cost containment and cost management, but a lot of energy on growing the top line and growing revenue. So that it can continue to drop through more profit as we go forward. I won't attempt to characterize whether or not it achieves the same sort of levels as analog, but we are confident there remains room of improvement in that overall P&L, primarily from continued cost containment and a drive towards revenue growth. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse : You mentioned, as my follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared comments some of the inventory growth you saw in the March quarter. Just kind of curious how long it takes to get back closer to trend, as you exit June, would you expect to see days closer to your trend line, or how should we think about that? Kevin March : Yeah. I think what's actually interesting, John, is our dollars of inventory are actually down year over year. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, our days of inventory were up, and that's up on the expectation of increased shipments in the second quarter. And plus there's a few extra days that are inside that 1Q inventory as a result of the slowdown in personal electronics that we mentioned 90 days ago. We expect that material is going to ship over the balance of the year. And between the increased shipments in 2Q and the shipments of that personal electronics material, we'll see the days of inventory drift back down comfortably inside our model, very similar to what we saw last year. If you go back and take a look last year, we were also a little bit higher in the first quarter, anticipation of second quarter growth, and then days drifted down as we came through the year. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari. Please go ahead. Unidentified Participant : Hi. This is Charles [ph] on for Toshiya. Your Q2 guide at the midpoint, flat to down year-over-year growth, I was kind of wondering when you expect to kind of return to growth and what the drivers of that will be. Dave Pahl : Yeah. So I think if you look at the midpoint, you're right, the year-over-year growth would be down about 1%. As we talked about before, we, on a year-over-year basis, we'll still have the growth impacted due to the weakness inside of personal electronics. Outside of that, we expect to see our businesses growing both sequentially and year on year, and again I think that we're on a good position to capitalize on the trends of industrial and automotive. We think longer term that that's where the growth in our industry will come from. And just as a reminder, we had last year about 46% of our revenues driven by there. So we feel good with where our products are positioned. Unidentified Participant : Got it. And then gross margin performance was strong, if you want. Outside of lower depreciation and incremental 300 millimeter revenues, where are the other factors that are going to drive upside from here? Kevin March : Well, you hit two important ones. So we have lower manufacturing costs year over year, driven by, as you mentioned, lower depreciation and increased 300 millimeter wafer starts. But we also had a retromix of overall products. As Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, industrial was up very solidly for us, and in the industrial space we enjoy a very nice mix of overall profitability. So you have that combination of events going on. And again, to Dave's comments a moment ago, as we continue to see content growth in industrial and automotive, we would expect to continue to see an improvement on our mix from a profitability standpoint too as we look out over the quarters and years. So it's all coming together very nicely for us right now. Dave Pahl : Okay, great. Thank you. And we'll go to our next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. In the quarter, OpEx came in a little higher. I was wondering if you could tell us the driver, what drove that, and what your thoughts are for OpEx for Q2. Kevin March : Yes, Stacy, OpEx did come in a little bit higher than what we had planned for. There really wasn't any one thing that drove that. There's just a number of small things that were being taken care of in the quarter. As we look into second quarter, recall that 1Q includes about two months' worth of our annual pay and benefit increases. If you look into 2Q you'll need to account for that, that we would have the full three months of pay and benefit increases. I'd expect the change quarter to quarter to be very similar to what you saw last year. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein : Got it. Thank you, that's helpful. For my follow-up, I wanted to dig a little bit into the comm infrastructure impact on both embedded processing as well as others. So, embedded dropped 8% year over year. You noted within your other business that your ASIC, custom ASICs, are down year over year. I think both of those tend to be driven very highly by comm infrastructure. Can you help us understand the differential between those two businesses? Is one of them eating the other for example? Dave Pahl : Yeah. So, first, let me talk about our embedded business. So, our embedded business, as you remember, has three product lines inside of it. Micro-controllers and processors are both about 45% of that revenue, and connectivity makes up about 10% of that revenue. So we saw growth in all three of those businesses, they all grew very nicely. But it was led by processors. So our communications infrastructure, processors would be inside of that business, but we also sell automotive products that are inside of that business that drove that growth. The -- in the other business, the custom ASIC business, I'll just say that we saw a different mix of products to customers, so it's not always the same. We've got some customers where we only sell both embedded and analog into those customers. So -- and that said, this is a reminder longer term, we do expect that the custom ASIC business will decline, because that functionality is being absorbed into our SOCs inside of the embedded business, so. Thank you -- Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein : Thank you guys. Dave Pahl : -- Stacy. We'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis. Please go ahead. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just talk about the outperformance in gross margin? You said 300 millimeters. I was just curious what the utilization rates are. And as you look into Q2, it seems that guidance implies kind of sustaining at that level. I just want to make sure that was right and what you're expecting to do with utilizations there. Kevin March : Yeah, the utilizations actually haven't changed that much in a number of quarters and we don't expect it to change much in the next quarter or two either. The amount of wafers that we're starting are pretty consistent as we go across the quarters. And Blayne, you can kind of see that in -- when our days of inventory is up in 1Q, we're building for increased shipments in 2Q that allows us to run the factories at pretty close to similar utilizations quarter over quarter, rather than ramping them up and down to meet in-quarter demand. So I wouldn't expect utilization to change that much going into the next couple of quarters just as it hasn't in the last number of quarters. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital : Got you. And then just my follow-up, you had a correction in consumer as you pointed out. As you look into the back half of the year, you said you expected to sell through. So do you expect your content in those types of [ph] applications to be roughly similar this year and therefore you should see a similar ramp like you did last year? Dave Pahl : Yeah, we haven't given color on how much content we have. I'll just say that, when we do engage where we like to be able to engage inside of personal electronics, those types of products that we'll sell across multiple generations of products, and that's not always the case on every product that we make an investment in, but that's where we want to steer our investment dollars. So we're confident that, as we build that inventory, that we'll have demand in the back half. We won't try to predict at this point what that demand will look like, so. Thank you, Blayne, and good to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the site of Harlan Sur. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Another solid showing by the embedded business. You pointed out particular strength in processors, I think you guys talked about comms as a driver there, and maybe some automotive. But your MCU products also grew nicely year over year. Maybe you can just give us some insights on the end-market/applications that drove the growth in that sub-segment. Dave Pahl : Yeah. You know, our MCU business is really a great business that we're building. And as you know, we've been investing in that business for some time. We've got and continued to invest both in TI-based architectures as well as ARM-based architectures, and we've got customers that want to have both of those. And we continue to be selective on where we make those investments. Part of the, you know, the way that you differentiate those products is by having peripherals that are optimized for different types of applications. We developed micro-controllers that are targeted for ultra-low-power battery-backed operations that'll be in-fielded for, in some cases, decades, as well as very high-performance-based microcontrollers, so. And we've got very strong connectivity solutions, both wired, but as well as wireless. And that crosses over into our connectivity business that we've got there and that we support over a dozen different interface or wireless standards inside of that business. So, again, very, very broad-based, and we really are encouraged by the results of that business. You have a follow-on, Harlan? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan: Yeah. But in the industrial markets, which was obviously an area of strength for you guys in the March quarter, you guys have talked previously about servicing like I think 14 different sub-segments, so, very broad. Dave Pahl : You're correct. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan: You've also talked about content gains in industrial, which is kind of a similar dynamic to the automotive segment. Any of those sub-segments within industrial that are showing more of a bias towards more dollar content gains on a go-forward basis? Dave Pahl : Yeah, I think, Harlan, the one nice thing about automotive is we can more easily identify what unit SAR growth is and there's enough analysts that follow that market that we can track with the semiconductor content gain. And there we think that there's probably somewhere around $350 on average that sells into an automotive. That's a number that's been growing very nicely. When I look at that, that's probably about 1% of the average sales price of a car, so it's not too hard to imagine that that number will continue to grow and grow significantly over the future. When you contrast that to industrial, and we think we're in the very early stages of maybe where we were three, five years ago in the automotive market with industrial, you really can't do that same type of analysis, unfortunately, because we've got 14 different sectors that we sell into. Underneath that there are literally hundreds of different end equipment that we track and develop solutions for. And there's just a very, very wide variety of applications. So we can see it going on. And the beauty of it is it's not just one thing. It really is a growth on a very broad basis. And I think that that's reflected in our numbers, not only this quarter but it's been reflected in the numbers for a number of quarters now. So we really look forward to that opportunity in the future. Okay, Harlan. Thank you. And we'll move on to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for taking my question. One more on gross margins. Is the 60.6% the new baseline and we should model the flow-through from this level, or are there any mix benefits that are helping you in the first half that might reverse when the smartphone shipments start to ramp in the second half? Kevin March : Well, you'll have several things going on across that. That's a pretty tough call to make and more time to get too precise. We would expect industrial and automotive to continue to be a growing portion of our revenue over time. That's where we're focusing our attention, especially R&D dollars. We also expect more starts, as we look out into the future, proportionately more starts on 300 millimeter, which is lower cost wafers. We would also expect the depreciation and declines that we've been seeing this past year to continue, albeit at a slower pace than what we've seen in the last few quarters. So those will give you tailwinds, so even if you do have some of these other products start back up, [inaudible] mix going on inside there that these margins that we're operating at right now are probably representative of what the portfolio can do for our shareholders. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. [Inaudible] Kevin. And as my follow-up, you mentioned that sales growth in Q1 plus what you're guiding to Q2, excluding, I don't recall whether you said personal electronics or just your largest customer, that sales growth is actually up year on year. Could you help us quantify what that growth trend is versus last year? Dave Pahl : Yeah, Vivek, we're not being that precise. We just wanted to give some color generally that, you know, where we had that headwind and the demand changing late in the fourth quarter, that that portion of our demand inside of personal electronics, that we expect that it will grow sequentially but be down significantly year over year. And we just haven't gotten more precise than that, so. Okay. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll move on to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore. Please go ahead. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : Thanks for letting me ask the question guys. I guess the first question would be, your first quarter came in at the high end of the range. Can you just talk about what was the positive surprise in the quarter? And maybe associated with that, Dave, I think in the past you have given sequential end-market performance to match what you've given and then year over year, if that helps to answer both questions, that will be great. Dave Pahl : Yes. So again as we had said earlier, that portion of demand where we saw weakness came in about as we expected. The strength was more broad-based, and we continue to, obviously, to see strength in automotive and then the improvement in industrial and comms equipment. So, very, very broad-based strength that we saw. So the second part of your question was sequentially. What we saw from the trends there, no surprise that automotive remained very strong, and it was driven by infotainment as well as the hybrid electric and powertrain systems. Industrial, again we had growth across almost every sector inside of industrial. Personal electronics down, with most sectors declining. And comms equipment was up sequentially, and that was the third quarter in a row that it actually grew. And then enterprise systems was up due to projectors. So, did you have a follow-on, Ross? Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : Yeah, I'll make it quick. And you just talked about the comms side, the third quarter in a row it's been up. Generally, how do you think about that versus where we are after earning a ton of inventory and now coming back, are we to the point where we're shipping to end-demand and then now we can grow or shrink with that, or is there some other dynamics going on? Dave Pahl : Can you repeat the first part of the question? Because you just cut out a little bit on our side. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : Sure, I'm sorry. So you said your comms business was actually up for the third quarter in a row. Dave Pahl : Right. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : Obviously that had fallen due to the end-market before that. Dave Pahl : Yeah. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank : So the question is, do you think you're back to shipping to end-demand and what do you view to be the growth trajectory of that business longer term? Dave Pahl : Yup. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I would say that, you know, that business, as you know, Ross, has always remained choppy, and we had a very strong period of growth going back a year ago, followed by declines that we saw last year. It's just, you know, it's really tough to be able to predict what's going to happen in that market. And we just positioned product and inventory to be able to respond if that demand will continue to strengthen. And if it doesn't, we know how to react in that environment too. So it still continues to be a really good business for us. We continue to make investments in it. And we just know that it'll be choppy. Longer term, we don't view it as a market that will be a growth. We don't think that operators will take their CapEx spending up over the next 5, 10, 15 years. But we do think that there will continue to be shifts in how they spend that money. So we continue to make investments where we believe that that growth will be in the future. So, thank you very much and we'll move to the next caller please. Operator : Yes. We'll take our next question from the site of Chris Danley. Please go ahead. Chris Danley - Citi: Hey. Thanks guys. I apologize if these questions have been asked before. I got on here late, I was listening to Zylex [ph] slamming my head against my desk. It sounds like you're guiding for a roughly seasonal, slightly below seasonal environment. If you could just kind of compare now versus a quarter ago, versus a year ago or the last six months how you feel overall about the overall environment. Is it seasonal, a little below seasonal, better than seasonal, getting better, getting worse? Any comments there? Dave Pahl : Well, I'd just make the observation that we believe we're just continuing to operate in a very similar macro-environment that we've seen in the last few quarters and even in the recent years. And our guidance obviously is our best estimate of how we'll perform. So we try to stay away from making any precise comments on what a seasonal quarter looks like. As you know, Chris, just -- because if you look at the numbers, there's usually a pretty wide variation on what an average would tell you that it would be. So again, just very similar macro-environment to what we've seen. You have a follow-up? Chris Danley - Citi: Yeah. Real quick, just on channel inventory and distribution inventory. I think you said that channel inventory was up a couple of days, around 4-1/2 weeks. Do you expect channel inventory or disti inventory to go up again in Q2? And then if you could just give us kind of the range that channel inventory/disti inventory has been in for the last, call it, two or three years, is this basically the bottom or a little off the bottom or closer to the peak, or where would that be? Dave Pahl : Yeah. Well, we've, as you know, we've, several years ago, implemented our consignment program, so I think we still continue to learn what the right level in that -- in the channel will be. And I'd just say that if we could actually convert all of our shipments and distributions to consignment and carry that inventory ourselves, we'd actually prefer to do that. So if anything, we'd encourage our distributors to take advantage of those programs. We've operated I'd say around four weeks to 4-1/2 weeks I think for some time. That number probably, you know, somewhere in that range, even if it drifted up a little bit, it always just depends on the products that's out there and the speed at which it turns. But we've got other peers that measure the inventory in months, and not weeks. So we're very, you know, efficient on how we use that channel. And it works out really well for both of us and our distributor partners. So we feel very good about where that level is overall. So thank you, Chris, and we'll go to the next caller please. Chris Danley - Citi: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess, question from me, I think the lower depreciation helped you guys on the gross margins about 130 basis points year over year. Do you think that magnitude can sustain throughout calendar 2016 or should we think about depreciation dollars to be more of a flat [inaudible]? Kevin March : I made a comment a few minutes ago that the rate of depreciation, decline, that we have seen over the past year is -- will slow down meaningfully as we go into 2016. Recall that, from a capital spending standpoint, our model is to spend about 4% of our revenues on CapEx, which we have been doing for the last couple of years, and we expect to continue this year. Our depreciation runs more than 4%, so clearly they'll have to converge at some point. Our depreciable life on most of our equipment is five years. And you may recall that it was about five years ago when we brought on several new factories, one in Izu [ph], some equipment to be brought in to our fab here in the Dallas area, and a factory we bought in China. And so we're seeing those depreciation occurrence roll down now. So the rate of the decline that we saw over the last few quarters this past year will slow down, although it will still decline as we go into 2016. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets : Got it. And if I just follow up, I think you guys have about a billion dollars of debt that's due in the month of May. Is the thought process to just pay that off with cash on hand and roll it forward, and what would that implication have for your interest expense line as you go forward? Kevin March : Well, if we pay it off, the interest expense will clearly decline. But I expect that we'll probably do what we've done similarly in the last couple of cycles on this where we have, if the interest rates are favorable by the time we go back into the market, we'll likely pay off a portion and roll the balance into a new issue. In either case, whether we pay off the entire amount or just pay off a portion, roll over the balance, I would expect interest cost will decline by several million dollars a quarter. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Amit. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Please go ahead, Tore Svanberg, your line is open. Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Yes, thank you. So, Silicon Valley Analog was up year over year, and that -- I mean that's better than the industry, better than your peers. Was that mainly due to industrial and automotive strength or were there some shared gains, all the things going on there? Dave Pahl : Yeah. Tore, SVA does have a good exposure to both industrial and automotive, and that certainly helped that business. Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. And as my follow-up for Kevin -- Kevin, do you have a CapEx number for us for this year or should we just take 4% of whatever revenue we come up with? Kevin March : Well, keep it simple, just take 4% of your expected revenue number and you're going to be pretty close to what we're spending. Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus : All right. Sounds good. Great job guys. Thank you. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Tore. We'll go to the next caller please. Operator : And we'll go next to the line of Ambrish Srivastava. Please go ahead. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets : Hi. Thank you. I had a question on the automotive business. Dave, we haven't talked about the momentum that you guys seem to be witnessing here. Big, sizable business, bigger than your peers, and year after year, just like the rest of the business, it's boring, but it grows. So the question I had was, where are the new opportunities that you guys are now designed if we were to look at where automotive to TI was, say, a couple of years ago? So, what should we be thinking over the next couple of years? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Sure, Ambrish. Yeah. The automotive business that we're building continues to be very, very broad-based. So we've got strong participation in both analog as well as embedded. Inside of embedded we've got both processors and microcontrollers, as well as even some connectivity designs inside of that business. From an analog standpoint, it actually is very, very broad-based. And one of the things that we've been focused on is broadening the number of business units that the company participates in automotive. And I think if you went back five, ten years ago, we might have had one or two business units participating in that marketplace. And today, out of our 70 or so different business units, I think over half of them actually ship products into that marketplace. So it's very, very broad-based. We've got five what we call sectors that make up the automotive market. And again the largest one is not more than mid-single-digit as a percentage of our revenue last year. So they are -- the five segments are infotainment and cluster [inaudible] safety, advanced driver, assist systems or ADAS as it's known, body electronics which also includes lighting, and then the hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain. So we've seen growth across all of those sectors, very, very robust growth and a very broad range [ph]. So you have a follow-on, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets : No, that was it for me, Dave. Thank you. Dave Pahl : Okay. Operator, we've got time for one more caller. Operator : Okay. We will take our final question from the line of William Stein. Please go ahead, sir. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Hi, great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave, around the middle of last year I think was the first time you highlighted the potential for a 10% customer, and maybe we'd been sort of dancing around this point, but I wonder if you expect that that customer will repeat at a similar magnitude in this year. Dave Pahl : Yeah. You know, that's a projection that I won't make on today's call. I think that they and all of our customers, we've got teams that work very, very hard to get products designed into. And with that largest customer, as we talked about before, we sell them hundreds of products, we participate in all of their major platforms. And of course the revenue would always be skewed where they ship their products, and I think they've publicly reported that about two-thirds of their revenues would be in phones. So our revenues will mirror those types of shipments. So we've got good growth in automotive, we've got -- we're seeing strengthening and broad strengthening inside of industrial. And that's a trend we'll see, how those trends continue for the balance of the year. There's a lot of time between now and the end of the year. And then we'll see what happens inside of personal electronics as well, so. You have a follow-on Will? William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Yeah, one on capacity if I can. I'm wondering if you acquired any capacity as you do periodically and if there's any update on the planned fab closure in Scotland? Kevin March : Yeah, William, I'll go ahead and answer that one. We have been -- we continue to acquire capacity. No new factories here lately, but we do continue to pick up equipment that was quite expensive new for pretty good prices when you buy them the way we buy them. As it relates to the closure of the factory in Scotland, as a reminder, we expect that factory will not close before the end of 2018, as it has been with other factories in the past, when we close those things, they either take a couple of years. As you slowly do lifetime builds on the inventory, and on certain other parts of those factories you'll recall other existing factories. And that's just a multiyear effort. So it's progressing as plan and we again don't expect it to actually complete until about the end of 2018. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you very much, Will. And thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : We'd like to thank everybody for their participation. Please feel free to disconnect your line at any time.",

LLC Operator : Good day and welcome to Texas Instruments' 2Q 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the Web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were solidly in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with the year ago, demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and grew in industrial and communications equipment markets. Despite sequential growth, demand in the personal electronics market was down from a year ago. In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 9% and Analog revenue was about even with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.76. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 7% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30% of revenue, up from 27.4% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue was about even with growth in High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog, was offset by declines in High Volume Analog & Logic and Power Management. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 9% from a year ago due to growth in all three product lines, led by Processors. Our investments in Embedded continue to build a diverse business of long-lived products that contribute to free cash flow growth over the long term. In our Other segment, revenue declined 4% from a year ago due to calculators, royalties and custom ASIC products, which was partially offset by DLP products. Now I'll move to provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with the majority of sectors growing, led by infotainment. Industrial demand had broad-based growth, with more than half of the sectors growing. Personal electronics declined broadly, led by mobile phone. Communications equipment grew from a year ago, but declined sequentially. And finally, enterprise systems grew. We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes, taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.0 billion with 61.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 300 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $805 million, up 2% from a year ago. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.29 billion on research and development, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Operating profit was $1.12 billion, or 34.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 11% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.7% and for Embedded Processing, 25.0%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second quarter was $779 million, or $0.76 per share. Now let me comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.07 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 133, consistent with our long-term model of 105 days to 135 days as we stage inventory for expected revenue growth in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $158 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 9% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million, or 4.5% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity to be about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion, or 30.0% of revenue. Free cash flow was 7% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested into the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement. For those who may have missed it, in May, we issued $500 million of six-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.85%. In addition, we've retired $1 billion of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.63 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.22%. In the second quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $527 million of our stock for a total return of $909 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.07 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitments to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $2.54 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.33 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, for the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.91. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter and for the year. In summary, we believe our second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And our first question will come from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. Great quarter. So it seems like the revenue was above the midpoint like you said. Can you just maybe talk about the strength you saw, or what was stronger than expectations by segment or by end market? David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, Chris. I'll just say across our businesses, I'd just say that most areas performed a bit better than our expectations. Obviously, there's always puts and takes, but in general, that was the case. And obviously, that put us solidly in the upper half of our range. Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. And for my follow-up, if we plug in some sort of normal seasonal growth in Q4, it looks like revs will be flat to slightly up. But it looks like OpEx might be up as a percentage this year. Is that true? Can you shed any light on whether that could happen, or it could not happen or what would be the drivers there? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Chris, you said Q4. Did you mean to say Q3? Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): No, we've already got it for Q3, but if we plug in some seasonal growth for Q4 you get revenue around the same level as last year. It looks like OpEx might be a little bit higher as a percent of revenue this year versus last year. A, is that true? Can you comment on that, or talk about the puts and takes on OpEx? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Well, I'll wait 90 days and give you what we think that the Q4 range is going to be for revenue and then we kind of talk about where that is. Right now we'll just focus our comments on 2Q and 3Q if you don't mind, Chris. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Chris. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Sure. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. First, could you give us an idea of \u2013 in the current quarter how much personal electronics was down year-over-year? And for Q3, how do you see that trending? Do you still see that business down year-over-year in Q3? David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, Stacy, we don't get to that level of detail. I can say that we did see sequential growth as we were expecting to see it. It is, obviously, still down significantly year-on-year, and we really just haven't provided guidance out into third quarter. And again, if there's anything that's moving around that's significant, our practices have been to call that out to provide clarity. So I think with our results coming solidly in the upper half and our guidance that we're providing, we're just not going to that level of detail at this time. Do you have a follow-on? Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Can you give us some idea of gross margin drivers in the quarter? It seems like gross margins came in a little stronger. And how do you see those drivers trending into next year? Do you think gross margins should be up on the higher revenues? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Yes, Stacy. The drivers to gross margin in last quarter and going for the foreseeable future are the same things we've been seeing for a while, and that is we're seeing depreciation rolling off, which is clearly giving us an accounting benefit to gross margin, but more importantly, we've got increased production on 300-millimeter, which is considerably more cost effective on a chip level than the equivalent 200-millimeter production. And as we see depreciation continue to roll off, albeit more slowly as we move into future quarters and more production on 300-millimeter, we'll continue to see benefit to gross margins. So I think that what you've seen going on is just a prelude to what you'll see going on as we look out a little bit further. If you look out further in time, as to what to expect, I think we'd just tell you to do what we've been doing in the past, which is on any delta revenue that you forecast in your model, that falls through around 70%, 75% on average over time, that will give you a pretty good way to anticipate what the company's gross margin will stack up as. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Stacy, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess, first off, CapEx looks like it was a little bit higher a line (13:48) you guys have talked about in the past. Can you just talk about how do you think about it for the rest of the year and at what point you think CapEx that approximates inflation (13:55)? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Amit, you were a little quiet. I think you were saying that CapEx a little higher than in the past? David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, that's what I had heard, too. We're having a little bit of trouble hearing you, just so to summarize your question, you were saying CapEx was higher than it has been in the recent past and why is that? Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, sorry. Right. And at what point do you think CapEx is going to approximate depreciation for you guys over time? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Okay. So CapEx is going to be noisy in any one quarter. So it makes most sense to kind of look at it on what we think is a trailing 12-month basis. And over the last 12 months, CapEx was running about \u2013 well about 4.5% over last 12 month's revenue. Depreciation has been running about 5.2% to the last 12 months' revenue. So obviously, those will converge at some point, but I don't expect those to converge before the end of 2016. They may converge in any one quarter, but on that trailing 12-month basis, it will take a couple more quarters before we see those meet up. And again, remember our long-term model is to keep our CapEx spending at around 4% of revenue, and that includes the conversion and expansion of our 300-millimeter capacity for Analog production. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Do you have a follow-up, Amit? Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Yeah, if I could just follow up, OpEx I guess at least in the June quarter it looks like it was higher than expected. Sort of compare with what happened in the March quarter if I'm not mistaken. So could you just talk about how do you get OpEx as a percent of sale and what's driving the higher uptick there? It sound like it looks like it's more R&D than anything else in the first half of the year so far. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Yeah, I'm not so sure, Amit, it was higher than expected per se, but it was certainly higher than it was last quarter and higher on a year-over-year basis. You've got a couple of things going on there. Sequentially, you've got three full months of pay and benefit increases, so last quarter you only had two months' worth. That's also true year-over-year, by the way. We just got pay and benefit increases. But also importantly on the R&D as you noted, we have been for a number of quarters now reallocating our internal resources towards more development efforts. So those will be resources that may have been working in manufacturing support or that may have been working in SG&A, and we're re-deploying those resources into development activity and R&D. And we expect to continue doing that for a number of quarters to come. And so consequently you're seeing R&D begin to move up a little bit more than you might see on the G&A line. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Amit. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And next will be C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question to go back to your incremental gross margins and try and maybe dig a little bit deeper in understanding how much is going off of D&A mix utilization, the benefit of 300-millimeter. So if we look at calendar 2016 and things play out seasonal, it looks like $150 million benefit from D&A but another $200 million from those other categories. Is there any way to parse that out and then better understand, go forward, what that might look like for each of those categories' mix utilization 300-millimeter? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Yeah, C.J, just to think about that, from another utilization standpoint, frankly, there's no real benefit going on there. The underutilization costs and almost exactly the same for multiple quarters in a row now. Depreciation has actually come down, so you compare the most recent quarter at $155 million depreciation, the year-ago quarter was $198 million. So you're getting about a $45 million depreciation lift. So really the rest of it's just lower overall manufacturing costs. And again, incrementally we're getting more production on 300-millimeter, which at the die level has a 40% cost benefit for us. So that's an overall 20% improvement to gross profit margin on \u2013 or excuse me, 20 \u2013 takes gross profit margin up effectively because cost comes down by that amount. So you've got the combination of all those things weighing together. So again, depreciation down about $45 million 2Q to 2Q on a year-over-year basis. Underutilization charges pretty flat throughout that period. So it's really a conversion to lower cost manufacturing. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Right. And I'll just add for those that may not follow us as closely why 300-millimeter makes a difference, so we've got a footprint manufacturing Analog products at 200-millimeter, and the 300-millimeter we ended last year with about $6 billion of open capacity on 300-millimeter, and the wafer size is bigger and that translates into a lower cost, as Kevin was talking about, at a chip level, where the silicon level is 40% lower. So basically as we build more of our products on 300-millimeter that will help to drive gross margins as well as free cash flow. So C.J., you have a follow-up question? C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Yeah, Dave, that was very helpful. If I could just ask a short-term question. In terms of gross margin into September, will mix be a headwind there or should we say gross margin's at least flat? Thank you. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: C.J., I don't think that mix is really going to play too much of a factor in this. We're going to continue to have more production on 300-millimeter and lower overall manufacturing costs, and it's really just the economics that Dave just mentioned that's going to keep on helping on gross margin going forward. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, C.J., and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you can give us an update on the Embedded Processing segment? You're showing some nice growth there. Can you talk about where that's coming from, and in particular the old \u2013 the previous wireless business's OMAP connectivity, can you talk about growth that you might be seeing there? David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, sure, Joe. So year-over-year, as we had said before, we're seeing good growth in all three product lines, and just as a reminder, for 2015 we had three product lines inside of Embedded : microcontrollers, which made up 45% of revenue; processors, again 45%; and connectivity at 10%. So I'll just say over the last few years, connectivity has been growing very strongly, though it's coming obviously from a much lower revenue base. And there we support a dozen or so connectivity standards, and those products are finding \u2013 I'd just say very, very diverse different applications and doing very nicely. Processors, again, is doing very well. It is being benefited from both the automotive, as well as recovery that we saw inside of comms infrastructure. And then microcontrollers is benefiting from really the industrial market as it is finding very, very diverse application. So that's kind of what that looks like across the board. Do you have a follow-up? Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, that was very helpful. Thank you. Just separately, I wonder, are there any areas where you're seeing tighter availability or lead time extensions or anything like that across the whole portfolio? David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, I'd say that across the board our lead times have remained unchanged and at very, very low levels. So product availability continues to be very good. And both at our distributors as well as for the products that we support through consignment programs or in a classical book shift business. So really no changes on that. And I'd just also mention that just our on-time delivery, so kind of our metrics to when customers want to have them remain at very, very high level. So, okay. Thank you, Joe. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And that question will come from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question, and nice job on the results. Kevin and Dave, I wanted to follow up on Embedded Processing operating margins. For the last couple of years, the company's had the objective to get them higher and you've done a lot on the OpEx side and now for a second consecutive quarter we're in the mid-20%s. Can you put in context where operating margins are now versus, I think, levels that the company would be happy with? Is it possible to get to Analog levels, or are we at optimal levels now with EP? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: So, Craig, on that, I would say that there's nothing inherently different between the Analog and Embedded I'd point to to say why margins would be different. What I would say is that while we won't try to predict margins in the individual segments per se, we're confident that Embedded Processing just like Analog can be a very solid contributor to free cash flow growth over the long haul. And again, this is largely because the products that we manufacture in that segment have very long market shelf lives, and so you can get a lot of revenue stream off of your R&D that you spend. You may recall that over the last couple years, ending early last year, we were doing some restructuring activity in Embedded Processing and taken some costs out, and we've been talking for a while now that the real secret to being able to improve the profitability in that area was on revenue growth. And that team has been doing a very good job at turning the results of their efforts into solid revenue growth, and consequently we're seeing the profitability go up. They are committed to continuing in that direction, and so I look forward to seeing what they turn in as we go multiple quarters out. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Do you have a follow-on, Craig? Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks, Dave. The follow-up is related to Chris's question. You mentioned that the performance of the business was just a little bit better than expected on a broad-based basis in the second quarter. Was that because the order strength in the business was just better than the team thought going into the quarter, or was in fact the business just scoped a little bit more conservatively than it played out? What accounted for the upside versus expectations? David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah. So I would \u2013 I'd just point to that we've got 55% of our revenue that runs through consignment, so we actually don't get orders there. We get forecasts that get pulled to actual demand. We've got 60% of our revenues that run through distribution and 60% of that is actually on consignment. So our \u2013 what we ship, the demand that we ship to is much closer to real time of what customers want and need. So I think very simplistically, they just ended up pulling more, slightly more than what we were initially expecting across a broad range. So if there was something in there that we could point to, one or two things, we would do that, but that's just not the case this time. So, okay. Thank you, Craig. We'll go to the next caller. Operator : And we'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on the strong consistent results. Kevin, I wanted to talk a little bit about OpEx patterns into the calendar third quarter. For the last kind of three years you've had good sequential revenue growth in the calendar third quarter of about 6% and you've been able to take OpEx down on average by about 3% sequentially. And so I'm just kind of curious, is there a seasonal pattern to OpEx that we should think about for the calendar third quarter in general, and specifically how do you see OpEx trending this September? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Yeah, John, I think you've said it well in that you do tend to see some patterns similar to the numbers you just recited. Typically, you'll see SG&A and R&D down a bit in third versus second, and part of that is just people taking vacations and so on for the summer holidays. But I think this quarter you'll continue to see that sort of trend probably in the SG&A area. But I would expect that R&D would continue to increase a little bit as we move forward, dampening the overall decline that you might expect in OpEx. And that again has to do with what I mentioned earlier in the call, that for a number of quarters now, we have been redeploying resources into development activities. And those costs are winding up in R&D as we redeploy those resources. So as you look into third quarter, again, you're probably going to see that G&A will probably be down again a little bit, but R&D will probably be up some. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Is there a follow-on? John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's helpful. Yeah. As a follow-on, guys, one of the things you guys have always sort of talked about is the consistency of growth here, and not necessarily absolute growth, albeit you've talked about sort of modest share gain expectations every year. And just when I look at the Embedded Processing growth of over 9% year-over-year, to me that clearly is sort of outgrowing the industry and the peers. And so I'm kind of curious, what do you think the cause of that is? How sustainable that is, and kind of should we expect to see continued market share growth within the Embedded segment at these sort of clips? David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, John. We'll finish the year before we declare any victory laps on market share gains. And I'd just say that if you look at that business, as well as Analog, you know, we've just had steady share gains. And we've talked about averaging between 30 basis points and 40 basis points per year. But we've had years where we've put up 100 basis point gains in the past. So, again, we don't want to get ahead of where the year will end. We'll wait till the scoreboard is up before we analyze that. But we \u2013 I'd just say that we continue to focus our resources in places where we can develop products that are going to be differentiated, that are going to find a long-lived position in the marketplace. And when you're able to do that, you're able to have a revenue stream in which you're able to build on. And the great thing about both these markets is that share gain doesn't move quickly. And so \u2013 but it's just steady share gains over time will make a significant difference to the business model. And we think that that is certainly showing up in the numbers today. So thanks, John. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And next question is from Chris Caso with CLSA. Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC : Yeah, thank you. Just to start with kind of a bit of a bigger picture question. You talked about some of the forecast visibility from your consignment revenue. Can you talk a little bit about how far out that goes, and what the order patterns are telling you? And then correspondingly, what have you seen with regard to order rates over the last 90 days as compared to the previous quarter? Are they fairly stable, improving, or declining? David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah. So, Chris, it will depend on the customer or distributor. I'd say that typically we'll get \u2013 look out on demand out for six months. Sometimes it will be longer, we'll get a longer term forecast for them. But usually they run about six months. Inside of a certain window, those forecasts are deemed as more firm. But that said, they can change, and they can change very quickly. So we can have 100% visibility, but that doesn't mean that those forecasts can't change. From an order standpoint, I can tell you that during the quarter, we saw orders were higher in May. They increased again in June. That's kind of what happens in a second quarter. And I'd just say that those order rates versus when we were all on a book ship business without consignment certainly were a different signal than what they are today. So we look at those \u2013 the orders that we have on the books. We look at the consignment forecasts that we see, and we make judgments based on that and roll that all up to what we provide you in our outlook. So you have a follow-on, Chris? Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC : Yes. Thanks. With regard to inventory, it looks like it was down sequentially in days, but I believe it's toward the higher end of your range. Could you talk about your expectations? I suppose that you would expect that to drop as you go to the second half. Do you have a particular target in mind for where you expect the inventory to approach as we exit the year? And then what that implies for production in the second half? I know you often try to level load production given seasonality. Is that still the case this year? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Yeah, Chris. I don't really have a specific inventory forecast for you per se. I will just point out a couple things on inventory to kind of keep in mind. Total dollars of inventory are actually down on a year-over-year basis, even though days are up, and that's really a function of the higher profitability that the company's performing at now. When you just do the math at a higher gross margin percent, that same inventory affords more days of potential sales. So that's part of what's going on there. But as you noted, it is down quarter-over-quarter on a day's basis. And typically going into third quarter, typically tends to be an up revenue quarter for us, and as you mentioned, when we level load the factories, that would anticipate that some of that inventory will be drained as we go through the quarter. But we don't have a specific forecast as to days or dollars. We just expect that will probably drain somewhat going into the third quarter, and then we'll continue to adjust our loadings and our expectation for first quarter and fourth quarter as we continue through the year. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Great. Okay. Thank you, Chris, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And Blayne Curtis with Barclays is next. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question and I'll echo the congrats on the good execution. I just want to follow back up on a prior OpEx question, and just how do you think about managing it? Obviously, you've gotten the question probably two years in a row on why R&D as a percent of revenue is low. And it bottomed in 2015, you've grown it faster than revenue. How do you think about over the next year or two going forward? Is there a particular percentage you're managing it to? Or is it a function of where you can get gross margins? How are you thinking about it? And then if you can just talk about where you're deploying these new resources. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Okay, Blayne. So just at kind of a \u2013 first at a 50,000-foot level. We've talked in the past about our total OpEx will probably fluctuate between 20% and 30% of revenue, meaning that in weaker markets we might be running at the higher end of that range, in stronger markets we'll run at the lower end of that range. And here in the last couple of years we've been around the middle of that pack, around 23%, 24%, 25% kind of range. So that's kind of a high-level look at OpEx as a whole. Now more specifically on R&D, when it comes to allocating capital, and R&D is certainly a place where we allocate some of that capital to, it's a pretty important thing for any management team to pay attention to. We take it extremely seriously to make sure that when we do allocate to R&D, we'll allocate in areas that we believe that we can actually develop differentiated products with very long revenue streams and very high margin opportunities. The idea is to maximize the amount of revenue we get on the R&D dollar spent. So it's not a percent per se that we're trying to manage to. It's an opportunity that we're going after. And as we just talked about earlier in the call, some of our R&D spending is actually moving up a little bit even these past few quarters and will probably to continue to move up in the next few quarters as we are seeing opportunities to reallocate some of our resources from where they have been into development areas for R&D purposes that will just extend the overall availability of our products into new marketplaces. So we really look at opportunistically and not based upon a particular model or a percent of revenue or anything like that. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Do you have a follow-on, Blayne? Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Maybe just switching gears to the auto market. There's been concerns all year, but I think the data points have been stronger than not. Just curious, your perspective on that market as you go into September in terms of inventory, and the strength you saw, was that more a function of units, or was it more content gains through (34:44)? David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yes. Clearly, what's driving the market today, we believe, is content gains. And if you have visited an auto showroom any time in the last year, that's pretty obvious to see with the new models that are coming out. Our belief is that the automotive sales will fluctuate much like they have in the past and into the future. But certainly, overall, the content gain is what's growing things. So as Kevin said, when we look at the automotive market we're making investments that will produce revenue 5 years and 10 years and 15 years out into the future. If things were to weaken in that market and we don't know that's going to be next quarter or five years from now when that does, but we know how to handle those types of situations tactically. But it won't really change our investment levels and what we believe will be the drivers for our business and really the industry over the next 5 years and 10 years. So I hope that helped, Blayne. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And that question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on your Embedded versus Analog margins. I'm curious, how much of that delta is at a gross margin level, and how much is at an OpEx intensity level? And if it's on a gross margin level, what levers do you have? Is it just that you can move a greater proportion of these products to 300-millimeter? Or \u2013 I'm just trying to get a sense for how much improvement you can make in Embedded margins without necessarily depending on sales growth. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Yeah, Vivek, I would say we disclosed for, by segment, the revenue and the operating profit, and we don't dig into too many details underneath that as to what's happened between the lines. I would say that the \u2013 at the gross margin level, obviously, it does benefit from our continued efforts to lower our manufacturing cost. So that's clearly happening inside there from an OpEx standpoint, we have been reducing OpEx for a couple years, up through about May of last year. We've got that OpEx now mostly at the level that we want it at. So it really is a question of being able to drive revenue growth and get leverage off the OpEx that we have. And that leverage then falls straight through to free cash flow, which is a direct benefit, of course, to our shareholders based upon the formula that we've talked about with capital management. So that's how we tend to look at it, as opposed to trying to force a model on it that the two segments being comparable; we look at what they can actually generate, bottom line. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Do you have a follow-on, Vivek? Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thanks, Dave. So maybe you could help us quantify how much of your Analog sales are on 300-millimeter now and how much of your Embedded sales are on 300-millimeter? Thank you. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah. And, Vivek, we talked about in our capital management call, that we ended last year with about $2 billion of our Analog revenues, which were roughly about $8 billion in that year, on 300-millimeter, so approximately 25% of revenue. I will say that when you look at that factory where we're building it, we call it \u2013 it's our Richardson Fab, or we call it RFAB for short. That'll support $5 billion of revenue when it's completely full. And if you look at that $5 billion, one of the reasons why we believe that our manufacturing and technology is one of the competitive advantages that we've got is because that $5 billion is significantly larger than any of our Analog competitors that we've got. So that level of scale just doesn't make sense for them. And beyond RFAB, we've got and qualified our second 300-millimeter factory that we creatively called DMOS6, that just sits a little less than a mile from the office that we're currently in. So I can say that we did qualify that at the end of last year as we were anticipating, and we have revenue-generating wafers that are running through that factory today. So we'll update next year on our capital management call where we stand on that overall utilization. Our intention is to build more product inside of there, but we'll wait until then to update it. Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: And just a different part of your question, Vivek, that DMOS6 that Dave was just talking about is shared with Embedded Processing, in fact, so that is where some of the Embedded Processing 300-millimeter production occurs at. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, that's great. Okay. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : The next caller will be Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Great execution. I guess, the first question that I have is I was hoping you can comment a little bit on what customers are telling you these days as it relates to the consolidation the industry is seeing. I mean, are they coming to you and perhaps asking you to get into certain businesses? Because I assume they must be a little bit concerned about there being less and less suppliers. Just curious if some of those discussions have already happened with your customers? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: The only time that we had a conversation with our customers about consolidation was when we acquired National Semiconductor, and at that point in time, we had a lot of customers congratulate us and pleased that we were doing it because they knew we were friendly with business terms. Aside from that, I cannot point to any example of a customer coming to us and saying anything about the consolidation going on in the industry and what they think we should be doing about it. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah, and I'll just add to that, Tore. If you think of the business model that we're trying to put together, it's not focused on one customer or one or two products, where if you saw consolidation as an OEM, you might have significant concerns and maybe go to one of those companies' competitors. So I think to a large extent, that's probably why we don't have those overall concerns. Obviously, as you know, the Analog market continues to be extremely fragmented both from a customer base, as well as suppliers, even with the consolidation that we've seen. You have a follow-up, Tore? Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, that's really helpful. As a follow-up, just back to the near-term environment, so you talked about the sell-throughs probably being a bit better than expected. Do you think that was basically customers being too conservative? Or do you think customers are actually seeing strengthening in demand on their end? David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Well, I would just say, Tore, overall I think that we're operating in a similar macro environment to what we've seen in actually recent years, and that's just an environment that I'd say that it's okay, if I used one word to describe it. It's not really strong. It's not really weak, and we're operating in that type of environment. I think the benefit of us having consignment and having consignment with distribution is that our revenues more closely match that demand. That doesn't mean that they can't change quickly in the future at some point, but certainly we're shipping what we believe or what we know for sure on that portion of demand is \u2013 or those shipments is very, very close to actual demand and consumption. So thank you, Tore. And with that, we've got time for one more caller. Operator : Sure. And that question will come from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you so much. I guess I had two. First of all, can you talk a little bit about Brexit? I know that it seems like you're not seeing any impact from it, but can you talk just a little bit about whether you saw any perturbations around it? Or you've seen any stints? Or sort of what might worry you with anything around Brexit going forward? Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations: Tim, I would say that we really \u2013 it's pretty much impossible for us to be able to make a comment directly on that. Indications I've seen, the British economy is probably about 4% of the global GDP, so even if there's a wobble inside that economy, it's going to be really hard for us to be able to detect it. I would say that what we really do see is our customers are global. They sell globally, and it's a larger macro environment that we're in. And as Dave said a few minutes ago, that macro environment has been, and we believe will continue to be relatively slow, and so it's up to us to execute as best we can inside of it to gain market share. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : You follow, Tim? Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. And then \u2013 yeah, yeah. And then just back to personal electronics, I'm going to ask it sort of a little bit of a different way. I think you said last call that it would be a little less of a headwind in the second quarter than it was in Q1, and it sounds like it was less of a year-over-year headwind. Can you commit at least to it being even less of a headwind in the third calendar quarter? I guess the reason why I ask is because it's a pretty big hockey stick as this all normalizes, so I'm just trying to sort of figure out when that hockey stick is going to come. Thanks. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : Yeah. Well, I won't try to get that granular on any one customer or any one market in providing a forecast. I'll just say that typically and what we saw last year, certainly PE had a very strong back half, right? And we saw the demand weaken very, very late in the quarter, so we've seen a headwind year-on-year the last two quarters as we described. So I won't put together a forecast for you in the second half, but I'd just point out that we did have a very strong second half last year. David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations : So I hope that helps a little bit. And with that, we will wrap up, and thank you for joining us today. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for your participation today.",

Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Ian Ing - MKM Partners John Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities Operator : Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments\u2019 Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. David Pahl : Thank you and good afternoon. And thank you for joining our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I\u2019ll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were slightly above our expected range. Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and strengthened in the industrial market. Demand in the personal electronics market was about even from a year ago. In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% and Analog revenue grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.94. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 29.5% of revenue, up from 27.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Also today, we announced a 32% dividend increase that Kevin will provide more detail on in a moment. From a year ago, Analog revenue grew 6% due to High Performance Analog, Silicon Valley Analog and Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in all three product lines, led by Processors. In our Other segment, revenue grew 7% from a year ago primarily due to calculators and DLP products, and was partially offset by a decrease in royalties and custom ASIC products. Now I\u2019ll provide some insight into this quarter\u2019s revenue performance by end markets versus a year-ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand improved and had broad-based growth, with most sectors growing. Personal electronics was about even despite continued year-over-year decline in demand from one customer. This decline was offset by growth elsewhere. Communications equipment grew from a year ago and was even sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew. We continue to focus on making our Company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes, taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Kevin March : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter of $2.28 billion was 62.0% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 380 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $804 million, or 21.9% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve invested $1.33 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Operating profit was $1.40 billion, or 38.0% of revenue. Operating profit was up 20% percent from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 40.9% and for Embedded Processing was 27.7%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the third quarter was $968 million, or $0.94 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million, or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300 millimeter Analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion, or 29.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 8% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we\u2019ve said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Our intent, over time, remains to return all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. Consistent with this intent, we\u2019ve announced a 32% or $0.12 increase in our quarterly dividend. This brings our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 annualized. I also will note we have updated our long-term dividend model from our prior target of about 50% of trailing four-year average free cash flow to a range of 50% to 80%. This new range provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend growth and share repurchases. Today\u2019s announcement extends our string of dividend increases to 13 consecutive years, which we believe are an important element of shareholder returns. In the third quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $500 million of our stock for a total return of $882 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 2% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $3.14 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This on-shore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.64 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. So in summary, we believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. David Pahl : Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about OpEx is roughly flat quarter-over-quarter R&D up and you talked about increasing R& D investment. Given that what are your expectations for R&D in total OpEx as we go into Q4 I know seasonally they would be down, but given the increases that we\u2019re seeing in R&D how should we think it OpEx next quarter. Kevin March : So Stacy I think as we\u2019ve talked about R&D what we continue to reallocate and we will continue to reallocate through the first half of next year resources from other areas of the company into R&D. But overall, you should think about OpEx in 4Q pretty much being the same as you\u2019ve seen in each of the last several years that is down, because we have seasonal benefit there just from the fact that there\u2019s going to be Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays going on. So total OpEx, the shift continued to be seasonally down. David Pahl : Do you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon : Yes, thank you. From a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the change in strategy between or apparent change in strategy between dividends and buybacks. Does that imply and I mean what does that imply in terms of how you see the current return on your own stock versus the potential for at least how you view the stability and strength of your business going forward, seems like you\u2019re allocating more into dividends now? Kevin March : Well. And that is correct. We are planning to allocate more towards the dividends at this point in time. We\u2019ve always said the buybacks will vary as a function of the stock price and a dividend model that can vary from 50% to 80%, we believe there is more thorough comprehensive or capital allocation. This new model provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend growth and share repurchases and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about here. David Pahl : Okay, great. Thank you, Stacy. Next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on the analog margin side. I believe record levels for you 40 plus here. I think the highest I\u2019ve seen out there is high 40s at linear. Curious do you think that you could achieve that over time and as part of that thought process what percentage of your mix would have to be on 300 millimeter to get to that kind of level. Kevin March : C.J. the possibility for improving margins in analog are not anything that we would hold back your expectation on, because you\u2019ve actually hit the essence of the formula there and that is we have more and more revenue being generated on 300 millimeter where we enjoy a significant cost benefit versus any of our competitors. We\u2019ll see that just falling straight through not just the margin, but all the way through the free cash flow which is most important in our mind. So clearly, as you pointed out, this has been a new height for our analog segment and that business still has plenty of runway underneath as we go forward. David Pahl : And than I just add C.J. that when you look at our practice of buying capacity well ahead of demand, that puts us in a places. At the end of last year, we had about $6 billion of open 300 millimeter capacity. So as revenue grows that was 200 millimeter capacity that will help to grow free cash flow margin as well as operating margins in the businesses that you\u2019ve been. So the fact that it\u2019s 300 millimeter, of course and the fact that it\u2019s 40% lower cost will certainly help us as well. Do you have follow-up C.J.? C.J. Muse: I do. A shorter term question, as you look to your implied guide of down 10% and I know typical seasonality is kind of throwing out the door here, but I guess in the last five years your average is roughly down 7%. So is there any one-time issues here, customer concentration, conservatism how should we think about that? David Pahl : Yes. I think if you look at the midpoint of the guidance C.J., it would suggest a year-on-year growth of about 3%. So I think in general, we just believe that\u2019s just very consistent with the modest overall macro environment. And that\u2019s really kind of been the case for the last few years. So our view really remains that we\u2019re in the slow growth economic environment. We don\u2019t really see any catalyst that\u2019s really going to change that one direction or the other any time soon. So thank you. We\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next caller is Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi, thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the demand environment. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on the different buckets within TI industrial personal electronics, comms equipment in automotive and specifically what sort of trends you saw in the quarter and more importantly what your internal expectations are heading into Q4. David Pahl : Okay. So let me just talk about what drove the quarter. As I mentioned before, the automotive market remained strong. We\u2019ve got five sectors inside of that market and most of them had grown double-digit. Industrial demand improved and encouraging part of that was it was very, very broad-based and we had most of the sectors growing. Inside the personal electronics that was even and that was despite continued year-over-year declines in demand from one customer, but I think that speaking to the diversity of our product portfolio and our customer base, we were able to offset that with growth elsewhere inside of personal electronics. And then communications equipment grew from a year ago was even sequentially. And lastly, we did see growth in enterprise systems as well. So when we look into the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll call out anything that is moving around significantly, you\u2019ve seen us do that in the past when we\u2019ve had some type of discontinuity to help explain the results and that\u2019s not the case as we move into fourth quarter. So do you have a follow-up Tosh? Toshiya Hari : Yes, I do. Thanks for that. So my second question is on M&A, clearly TI has been very disciplined especially with regards to valuation over the past couple of years maybe even several years. Obviously, you\u2019ve seen a lot of activity elsewhere in the industry, I was just hoping you could provide an update on as to how you approach M&A detail? Thank you. Kevin March : Tosh our first M&A is really no different than we\u2019ve talked about in the past. There are really four attributes that we think that we have put us in a pretty unique position versus our competitors and actually quite difficult for others to duplicate. Those include our approach to manufacturing technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, our reach to our market channels and the diversity and all that positions that our products enjoy in the marketplace. So when we look at the acquisitions, it\u2019s both trying to see if we can strengthen those four attributes and really if not so by looking at companies and standpoint of the strategic match. That means, we\u2019ll have strategic match delivered to the strength of the competitive advantage we\u2019ve been building on these last number of years. So from a strategic standpoint that would probably include a company that\u2019s likely engaged in Analog and probably has pretty good exposure to Industrial and Automotive which is where we believe most of the growth for some if that is going to happen for a quite a few years to come. If a potential target passes the strategy test and we\u2019ve got to get past the numbers test. And that really means the price that we pay for it. For the return on that price for the return on that investment capital exceed our weighted average cost of capital in about a four-year timeframe. If we can get all that to work then we will remain disciplined and just stay on the sidelines. As we look at what\u2019s been going on in the M&A landscape these last couple of years and strike us that there are probably really two things underway for most participants in that space they\u2019re either trying to increase their scale or broaden their market opportunities because they have fairly narrow markets. In our case, we already enjoy advantages in both of those, so we don\u2019t feel compelled to have to move unless we can pass that strategy and match test I just talked about a moment ago. David Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Toshiya. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : We have Chris Danely with Citi. Christopher Danely : Thanks guys. I guess one more question on the Q4 revenue guidance. I am just looking at the results of the last 10 or so years and it\u2019s only been down double-digits I think once in eight years or something like that. I remember last year you guys got it down 7% sequentially. Has anything changed recently? Have you seen any change in order rates, any change in the end markets, change in linearity, change in anything I\u2019m just wondering why the downtime? David Pahl : Yes, again Chris, no big changes on that. I think it\u2019s just consistency with the overall macro and if you look over the last five years, we\u2019ve had a range from as high as down 1.3% and back in 2012 I think we\u2019re down 12.1%. So certainly our range that we\u2019ve given is certainly inside of those things from a sequential standpoint. So that\u2019s kind of how we are looking at them. Do you have a follow-on? Christopher Danely : Yes. Can you just talk about utilization rates? How much sort of below capacity you guys are? And where we should expect utilization rates to trend in Q4 and how you feel about inventory as a result of that? Kevin March : So Chris on utilization, it really hasn\u2019t changed much from probably last three or four quarters and I don\u2019t expect it to change anytime in the near-term. We load the factories on accordance with our expectation of demand and because of our inventory strategy sometimes that demands goes beyond just next quarter may include the following quarter. From an inventory standpoint to recall that our model is to have 105 to 135 days. We had quite a bit more inventory last quarter and we from a day standpoint and we had \u2013 David mentioned that we have built that anticipation of growing revenues in the third quarter. We have had those growing revenues and our inventory days dropdown to 117. So I expect that will continue to operate within the model days that we talk about and our utilizations will continue to be relatively stable as we\u2019ve seen in the last three four quarters. David Pahl : Great, thank you Chris. Next caller please. Operator : Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : Great, thank you. I have one short-term question and one long-term question. In the shorter-term you said Personal Electronics kind of flat year-over-year despite declines that one customer can give us a sense for which areas are growing year-over-year as other smartphones, PCs, where that growth components of that business right now? David Pahl : Yes, at that level we\u2019ve had PCs come in year-over-year about even which is an improvement from what we saw. I think that outside of that one customer we\u2019ve actually seen really broad based growth. And so I think that all the classical areas inside a Personal Electronics are doing well. So you have a follow-on? Joseph Moore : Sure, thank you. And then longer-term side as you look at your automotive business. Obviously that\u2019s a focus for you guys. Can you talk a little bit about how do you plan for that business and how much of your effort is sort of aimed at sort of traditional building block catalog type products, and when you think about markets like autonomous driving where there might be sort of systems level solutions how much are you thinking about the sort of need to do something, that\u2019s a little bit more revolutionary rather than evolutionary in that part market? David Pahl : Sure yes, so we have - we\u2019ve got five sectors that make up the automotive market for us that we look at their infotainment, safety, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems or ADAS, Body Electronics and Lighting and then power train systems, which include hybrid and electric systems. And we have a very intentional focus to invest across all of those five sectors. We\u2019re seeing that in the results with revenues and most of those sectors growing double digits and we have an approach inside of Automotive that is similar really across their other markets where we look to leverage our four competitive advantages and I think that that\u2019s helping to turn in those results. So we are favoring what I would say a catalog and application specific solutions. I wouldn\u2019t put that into the category of full turnkey system level solutions where we\u2019re doing what we would consider to be the work that our customers do. So we are providing them. Building blocks that have different levels of integration but we\u2019re not looking to provide a full ADAS system as an example. So will enable those systems and I think that that\u2019s pretty consistent with what you see across all the markets and sectors that that we serve, so. Okay. Thanks Joe and we\u2019ll go to next caller please. Operator : And we have Chris Caso with CLSA. Christopher Caso : Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess first question would be regarding your comments on the industrial segment you talked about some broad improvement. I guess could you talk about your level of visibility there and the likelihood of that sustaining into the end of the year and moving into next year? David Pahl : Can you just ask that once again make sure I got the question right, Chris. Christopher Caso : Sorry, it was regarding the Industrial segment and your comments on that you talked about broad improvement. If you can give some more color on that and your view on the potential for that to sustain into year end and into next year? David Pahl : Yes. I think as we talked about last quarter we did see an improvement in industrial demand it actually had been flat for several quarters year-on-year, so we were encouraged by that. This quarter we\u2019ve built on that a little bit and like last quarter it was very, very broad-based. I won\u2019t try to go in and try to predict how long that will last or carryforward, but I definitely would say that we were encouraged as we saw most of those sectors growing. Yes, follow-on Chris. Christopher Caso : I do kind follow-on is regarding inventory in both the channel at your customers and given the stronger growth in Q3 was any part of that growth perhaps contributed to some increase in inventory, understand that most of your inventory in the distribution channel on consignment now, but what\u2019s your view of customer inventory levels right now? David Pahl : Yes. So if we look into the distribution channel inventory is actually decreased by about a half a week and it\u2019s currently very, very low levels at about four weeks and that\u2019s pretty similar to what we saw a year-ago. So again, we just we believe that that inventory level just reflects an environment of really good product availability and we\u2019ve got you know good inventories on our books available to be able to ship. We continue to have very stable lead times and those things kind of taken together just drive very high customer service metrics. So customers in general are getting products when they want to have them. So and I\u2019ll just make the reminder too that four weeks of inventory is just structurally lower because of the consignment programs that we have at our major distributors. So thank you Chris and we\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : We have Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi, thank you. My first question is on the embedded side. This segment has been growing really well for the last third quarter in the year posting pretty good year-over-year growth. What\u2019s driving that Dave, I know it has three major segments? Could you just help us understand the drivers behind the growth? David Pahl : Yes I think when you look at the embedded market. We\u2019ve seen good growth there for a number of quarters and if you look at the end markets they have a very good exposure to automotives, to industrial, and to that the comps markets. So as we talked about the communications market or really all three of those markets contributed to the growth. And the great thing about the growth is it\u2019s very broad-based its not in. One market it\u2019s not in, one sector it\u2019s not driven by one technology. So we feel really good about the sustainability of that growth and the great thing with that is it\u2019s fallen through to the operating profit, which you can see inside of that business. And most importantly is following through to free cash flow growth. So you have a follow on Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes, I did. Could you talk a little bit your \u2013 that this seems to be a change in the relationship with how you work with your major distribution partners and our sense is this is nothing new, but could you just help us understand how you thought through the pros and cons of this change and whether it\u2019s just a matter of you having more in consignment or it\u2019s trade-off between confidence of sourcing your own wins versus potential loss in future sales? Thank you. David Pahl : Yes. So our relationship with distributors have been evolving and always evolving like any healthy business relationships of all, but especially as the reach of our channel advantages continues to strengthen. So you know you\u2019ve heard Kevin and I both mention our four competitive advantages and certainly the reach of our channel is one of them. And so that includes both the size and the skill of our direct sales and applications teams, but it also includes the growing capabilities of the web and TI.com. So as an example three years ago we discontinued our incentive programs for demand creation on accounts that represented about 80% of the TAM where we had resources calling on those accounts directly. We made that that change because our team is just more effective and efficient at and demand creation and this is played out as we\u2019ve continued to gain share every year since then. And more recently, we\u2019ve discontinue the incentives for remain balance of the accounts. So we expect as with all relationships that will continue to evolve but we do believe distributors will continue to play an important role in order fulfillment for our customers. Okay, thank you Ambrish. And we will go to the next caller please. Operator : We have David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong : Thanks very much. TI and several other chip companies had really impressive September year-over-year growth. That was many percent about guidance and you\u2019re also giving December guidance which is solid even then the year-over-year growth in December looks like it\u2019s going to be below September. Can you give us some feel as to what\u2019s happening here that things weaken and September progressed or is December particularly tough comparison? David Pahl : Yes. David if you look at our normal seasonality the one thing that we can conclude for sure is that the second and third quarter are seasonally strongest quarters fourth and first are seasonally weakest and so certainly that that will play in effect as we go into fourth quarter. So it\u2019s not unusual for us to see fourth quarter that\u2019s down and in fact why we point to the year-over-year guidance and how that is consistent with just our belief is that things in the macro really haven\u2019t changed too dramatically. So that has gone into the guidance. Do you have a follow-on. David Wong : No. I am good. Thank you. David Pahl : Okay. Thank you David. Operator : The next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and dividend boost. Maybe I\u2019ll also try my hand on this Q4 outlook question. Because I still don\u2019t know whether this is a top down forecast or it\u2019s a bottoms up forecast because with specific end market is going down sequentially so much for your overall sales to go down 10%. And I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s actually the other segment which had very strong growth in Q3 and I know Dave you mentioned on an year-on-year basis but last year I believe your sales were down in Q4. So the comps should have been easier versus the last year, so that\u2019s really my first question that is this top down forecast or is this a bottoms up forecast. Kevin March : I think Dave has probably answered that same question about three or four times now and the answer still going to be the same. It is our best outlook right now based up on a continuing weak macro economy. We had a book-to-bill in 3Q of 0.99 compared that to 1.0 a year ago. So the visibility into the quarter is a little bit reduce versus it was a year ago. There is no one market, no one customer, no one product, it is our best estimate at this point in time. And I\u2019ll remind you it does include a range and that range probably comprehends to high probability where will land fourth quarters. David Pahl : And I just add the fact that whenever we\u2019ve had a big discontinuity that you\u2019re searching around for, we\u2019ve been clear at following those things out. So we want to be able to provide that transparency when it\u2019s necessary. So do you have a follow-on. Vivek Arya : Yes. Thank you. Now given the focus on free cash flow, why isn\u2019t TI better utilizing an asset like your balance sheet because you\u2019re operating, if my numbers are right at about 0.15 net debt to trailing EBITDA and most of your peers are comfortable operating at three to four times. So given this low growth environment and sort of negative returns for holding cash, why is TI holding so much cash and why not buyback more of your stock if you think M&A looks expensive or not attractive right now. Thank you. Kevin March : I think its now you consider our stock quite undervalued at the moment in times. I appreciate that observation. We have been buying back shares every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2004 our method for buying back shares is to be disciplined and consistent in how we go about doing it. More importantly what we\u2019ve talked about is that we will buyback more shares when the price is lower and probably fewer shares when the price is higher. And so to that end we recently as with today\u2019s announcement have updated our allocation budget if you will for what we allocate in free cash flow to dividends from 50% of our trailing four years average free cash flow to 50% to 80%. We think this new range provides a more robust framework that allows us to adjust the allocation of our shareholder return between dividend growth and share repurchases. To as far as leveraging the balance sheet any further right now that balance sheet has been leveraged higher in the past, we have been slowly paying that debt back down over time which means the debt is available today and important strategic opportunities present some at the right moment in time. We believe that leveraging now just for the sake of leveraging would actually block the balance sheet and being available should an opportunity present ourselves out there from a strategic standpoint. David Pahl : Okay, great. Thank you, Vivek. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : The next caller is Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. I\u2019ve a question and a follow-up as well. I guess just starting on the dividend increase that you guys announced. Could you just talk about as I think about the future dividend payout strategies you guys have? Is it going to be more reflection of your free cash flow growth on an annualized basis or with the desire be to increase dividends along with free cash flow growth plus increasing the payout as you get to the midpoint of this 50% to 80% range. So how do I think about this on an annual basis? Kevin March : Well, I think if you think about that what you have been seeing is probably what you will see and that is our free cash flow has been growing consistently for quite a few years now. And our formula design means that by definition are dividends are increasing consistent with that. What this new range does is just give us more framework to adjust the allocation between dividends and stock buybacks. We call it that we take all the free cash flow and we use it either for dividend or buyback. And this allows us to allocate more towards dividend growth as opposed to buyback going forward. If we reach a point where share price tends to be relatively lower at a point in time then this allows us to slow down the dividend growth rate and adjust that back towards dividend repurchases. So that\u2019s what this new range is designed to do is to give us more flexibility to be responsive to the changing market valuations that we see out there. Do you have follow-on Amit? Amit Daryanani : Got it. If I can just follow-up, your R&D is sort of increased doubled-digit the few quarters. It sounds like, it will do so again. Does that suggest that you kind of shifting a little bit from harvesting towards investing more in your business? And if that\u2019s the case, should we recalibrate expectations maybe in calendar 2017 and 2018 that the share again that you guys are typically out 30, 40, 50 basis points could be somewhat higher given all the investments you\u2019re making? Kevin March : Well, certainly we\u2019re investing more in the R&D with the intent of continuing our share gains and ideally accelerating them. And really what we\u2019re doing on the stuff, we are being very disciplined on R&D as well. We\u2019re not spending just for the sake of spending, but we\u2019re spending because we have a higher degree of confidence and the ideas are coming to us that we can actually turn that into profitable revenue growth and ideally market share. And we\u2019re doing that by just reallocating our internal resources as we mentioned, meaning we\u2019re not taking our total spending up, but we\u2019re taking people who may have been working in the manufacturing lines or people who may have been working in sales or general administrative areas and putting them into working on R&D projects as well. So it\u2019s an overall reallocation internally and I would expect that that will continue to support our market share gains as we go forward. David Pahl : Yes. I would add that we\u2019ve gained on average 30 to 40 basis points of market share and I think we\u2019ve gained share each of the last six years. I think we\u2019re on track to be able to put a seven figure up and we\u2019ll wait for the numbers to get posted before we declare that. But again, market share just doesn\u2019t move quickly in the markets that we\u2019ve got and I think that just speaks to the quality of the market. So I think these opportunities that Kevin just talking about just gives us confidence that we can continue to have share gains into the future. Thanks, Amit and we will go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Ian Ing : Yes, thank you. In your prepared comments, you talked about being opportunistic in terms of purchasing assets ahead of demand, so do you anticipate any greater opportunities or fire sales as the industry I would say rapidly consolidates. I mean, you probably got enough wafer fabrication equipment, but maybe there\u2019s other areas like test and packaging? Thanks. David Pahl : Yes. Ian, I would say that we are continuously on the lookout for buying assets that we don\u2019t need now, but we believe we will need at some point in time, it could be a strategic cost advantage to us at some point in time and we have been in pretty much every quarter, picking up some piece of equipment here or there. But again, we look at the total opportunity, meaning, can we get the right price and can it be something that will contribute to our free cash flow as we go forward and so we look at it in that context when we consider these sorts of things. So I would expect that we will continue to be out there, making opportunistic acquisitions. Some may rise to the level of an announced, but most of them are probably just remain as they have been just spot purchases that we do from time to time as we look around the world. David Pahl : Yes, and I\u2019ll also point out we\u2019re making those purchases while keeping our CapEx at about 4% of revenues, so continuing to strengthen that competitive advantage. Do you have follow-up Ian? Ian Ing : Yes, over to embedded processing. Questions on expectations for DSP applications, should we think of it is largely communication infrastructure 4G and 5G. I noticed there is DSP, IT companies out there, they are talking about using these chips as accelerators for things like Deep learning, artificial intelligence accelerating some applications. David Pahl : Yes, I think when you look at our portfolio that the lines between what the DSP and what\u2019s not a DSP blur to some degree so like you said in the comm\u2019s equipment space you\u2019ve got processors that have multicourse of both arms and DSP\u2019s but also have a heavy component of hardware accleators. Our OMAP products that are gaining traction and automotive and other applications inside of industrial have DSPs inside of them. If you look at our communication products where we support over a dozen different standards that help machines be connected and be smarter, they will have now DSP inside of them. So we kind of just look at that as an enabling technology, the good news is that that business complements our analog product portfolio, very well it isn\u2019t one type of product or technology that\u2019s building that business. We\u2019ve got a very good diversity of customers that we\u2019re building over time. So we\u2019re encouraged by the confidence in the sustainability of that revenue and the wires underneath and the technology underneath are important on how we deliver it. But the business model is what\u2019s really encouraging for us. So okay, we can go to - have time for one more caller please. Operator : Our next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes, guys thanks for squeezing me in here. Kevin I guess my first question is you talked about OpEx being down sequentially in December quarter. Depending upon how much down sequentially it is, you could still have gross margins kind of flat to up in the December quarter and notwithstanding the revenue decline, you\u2019ve had in prior quarters were down revenue doesn\u2019t necessarily mean down gross margins. So kind of curious how you think about gross margins going into the calendar fourth quarter and what leverage you can still pull other than just volume to keep moving gross margins up into the right. Kevin March : John, I think you know that we normally don\u2019t try to give that precise of forecast other than just topline and bottom line and earnings. But I would just remind you that, just like 3Q benefited from lower costs we increased production in the 300-millimeter and depreciation rolling off. Depreciation will continue to roll off and 300-millimeter will continue to become a bigger portion of wafers that we start. So you\u2019ve got a number of underlying cost things that will continue to give us good results on the overall gross margin for those who are interested in that number. John Pitzer : That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. And then Dave I guess is my follow-up. You talked about your largest customer in Personal Electronics being down year-over-year in the September quarter. Do you think that\u2019s an accurate reflection of kind of their unit demand or is there something going on with your content or your pricing? Would you expect that customer to be down again year-over-year in the December quarter? David Pahl : Well I will say that I\u2019m not going to make any comments on their command. And with most of our large customers if I\u2019ll just generalize the comment, most of our large customers will be on some type of consignment or hub based systems. So there is usually not a large delay and the demand when it actually gets pulled and when it\u2019s used. There\u2019s always an exception to that overall. From a content standpoint, I think we\u2019ve mentioned before that we sell hundreds of products into our largest customers including our largest one and we continue to see win new products. So we\u2019re confident in the design wins that we\u2019ve got and the revenue that will drive overall. Okay, well thank you John for your call. End of Q&A David Pahl : Thanks everyone for listening tonight. A replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s call. We appreciate your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead. David Pahl : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter '16 and 2016 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our Web site at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the Web, and can be accessed through our Web site. A replay will be available through the Web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from managements\u2019 current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. Also with me is Rafael Lizardi, who will become our Chief Financial Officer, February 1st. Rafael joined TI in 2001, and was named Vice President in 2010, followed by Corporate Controller in 2012. He holds a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from the U.S. Military Academy of West Point, and Masters in Business of Administration from Stanford University. As you know, Kevin, who has been our CFO for 13 years, plans to retire later this year. During his tenure as CFO, TI's free cash flow per share has grown in average of 13% annually. Our dividend has increased by a factor of 24%, and our share count has been reduced by 42%. We\u2019ve all benefitted and learned a lot from his disciplined financial management and his commitment to ensure that owners of TI's shares get a good return on their investment. Kevin will continue to be with TI until October 2017 to transition his duties between himself and Rafael. I don\u2019t want to get too sentimental, but as this is Kevin's final earnings call, I want to say what a pleasure it's been for me to know and to work with him. TI is clearly a better Company because of his leadership. I will say he has an outstanding successor. I worked with Rafael for the past decade, and look forward to continue to work with him in his new role as CFO. With that, before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that\u2019s important to calendars. We plan to hold a call to update our capital management strategy on February 8th at 10 :00 AM Central time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide some insight into our strategy. In today's earnings call, Rafael, will cover the capital management portion of our prepared remarks and Kevin and I will cover the rest. Now, let's start with the quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7% from a year-ago, as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market. The improvement we saw in the third quarter in the industrial market continues. Demand in personal electronics market was down slightly from a year-ago. I'll elaborate more on our end markets in a few moments. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.02, and included $0.14 for items that were not in our original guidance for the quarter. With that back-drop, I will now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TIs business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-months period was $4.1 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. In 2016, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and repurchases. Turning to our segments, Analog revenue grew 10% from the year ago quarter. Revenue increased due to power management, high-performance Analog, and Silicon Valley Analog. High-volume Analog in logic was about even. Embedded Processing increased 6% from the year ago quarter due to processors and micro-controllers. Connectivity also grew. In our other segment, revenues declined 9% from a year ago quarter due to royalties and custom ASIC products. DLP products and calculators were about even. For the year, in total, Analog was up 2% and Embedded was up 8%. Combined, they grew 4% on broad-based growth and were 86% of TI\u2019s revenue for the year. We\u2019ve recently simplified the product lines inside our two business segments, Analog and Embedded. To align by product categories, our customers think about. Making it easier for customers to search and select products is becoming increasingly important in all of our markets, but particularly in industrial. Analog is now comprised of three product lines instead of four. These are power, signal chain and high-volume Analog in logic. Embedded goes from three product lines to two. Connected MCU, which merges connectivity and micro-controllers and processors, which is essentially unchanged. All of these changes are at the product line levels. Nothing changes at the segment level. To help you understand this structure, for 2016 within our Analog business, power would have been about 45% of Analog revenue, signal chain would have been about 35% and high volume in Analog and logic would have been the remaining 20%. Inside our embedded business, connected MCU would have been about 55% of embedded revenue with processors comprising the remaining 45%. Starting in our first quarter '17 earnings call, we\u2019ll use these product lines in describing the performance of our business segments. Now, let me describe our performance by end-market for 2016. This is a reminder we annually provide an estimate of TI\u2019s revenue by end markets. We breakeven to six categories; industrial, automotive, personal electronics, where this includes products such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets and TVs, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators. Specifically, in 2016, industrial comprised 33% of our revenue, up 2 points from 2015. Automotive was 18% of our revenue, up 3 points. Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points. Communications equipment and enterprise systems were 13% and 6% respectively, both year and to last year, while other was about 4%. We did not have a customer that was more than 10% of our revenue in 2016. For those of you who have followed TI for several years, you know that we\u2019ve been highly focused on a strategy where we\u2019ve been allocating our capital and we\u2019ve been driving initiatives to increase our market share and industrial and automotive. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content, and that they provide the diversity and longevity of products which translates to high terminal value of the portfolio. In 2016, industrial and automotive combined made up 51% of TI\u2019s revenue, up from 44% just two years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, but we are far from satisfied, and are continuing to make improvements, such as aligning our product lines in the way our customers search and select for TI products. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin. Kevin March : Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.13 billion or 62.5% of revenue. Gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased to 400 basis points. Operating expenses were $754 million or 22.1% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve invested $1.37 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which for the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Restructuring charges and other was $20 million net benefit, which includes a gain related to intellectual property agreement and a charge associated with realignment of our product lines, which Dave previously mentioned. Operating profit was $1.32 billion or 38.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 42.8%, up from 38.0% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 28.2%, an improvement of 480 basis points from year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Also, we signed several intellectual property agreements, which had total benefits of $228 million in the quarter. We recognize $188 million in other income and expense or OIE, and $40 million in the restructuring charges and other. Neither revenue nor gross profit was impacted by these agreements. Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.05 billion or $1.02 per share, which included a $0.14 benefit for items not in our prior outlook. These included $0.14 benefit for several intellectual property agreements, one set tax benefit related to the new accounting standards for stock compensation, and $0.01 restructuring charge. This quarter, we adopted a new GAAP standard that changes where we report tax consequences of employee stock compensation. When employee stock compensations are exercised or when restricted stock units test, either in excess tax benefit or deficiency maybe generated. The previous standard required that amount to be recognized in equity on the balance sheet. The new standard requires that amount to be recognized in incomes taxes on the income statement, impacting net income and EPS. In the fourth quarter 2016, this created a benefit of $0.01 per share and for the year a benefit of $0.13 per share. I\u2019ll also note that this accounting standard increases the diluted share count calculation by about 5 million shares. I\u2019ll now ask Rafael to comment on our capital management results. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Kevin. Let me start with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.39 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $110 million in the quarter. In 2016, cash flow from operations was $4.61 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $531 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. This includes the expansion of our 300 millimeter Analog capacity. Free cash flow for the year was $4.08 billion or 30.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 6% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. And will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business, or returned to shareholders. Our intent overtime remains to return all of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we received from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. This commitment is unchanged. In the fourth quarter, we paid $499 million in dividend, and repurchased $475 million of our stock for a total return of $974 million. Total cash return to owners in 2016 was $3.78 billion. This combined return demonstrates our confidence in our business model, and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.65 billion in dividend or 40% of trailing 12 months free cash flow. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months, and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter year-on-year for 51 consecutive quarters. In the fourth quarter, we passed an important milestone, reducing our outstanding share count to fewer than 1 billion shares, or more specifically, 996 million shares. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.49 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This on-shore cash is readily available for multiple uses. I will now turn it back to Kevin to close out our prepared remarks. Kevin March : Thanks, Rafael. Our orders in the quarter were $3.44 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenues to be in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion in the first quarter. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.88, which includes a $0.04 tax benefit related to the adoption of the new GAAP standards that I mentioned earlier. Acquisition charges, which are a non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and holds about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. It will then declines about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2017 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2016 was moderate again this year. However, our advantages in manufacturing of technology, portfolio grade to market reach and diverse and long-lived product positions, enabled important milestones in the year. These include solid revenue growth in our core businesses of Analog and Embedded, expansion of 300 millimeter Analog production, gross margin improvement of 340 basis points, operating margin improvement of 300 basis points, free cash flow margin improvement of 90 basis points, and continued free cash flow per share growth. We will continue to feed advantageous through disciplined capital allocation by focusing on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for our very long-time to come. Before, I turn it back to Dave and start the Q&A I want to say it's been a pleasure to work with all of you. I thank you for the time you've invested in understanding TI\u2019s performance and strategy, and I wish you all the best. While you will continue to have the benefit of working with our industry's finest Investor Relations Director, I'm confident when I say that you will also come to appreciate Rafael's integrity and intelligence as our new CFO, and you will come to truly enjoy working with him as well just as I have for all these year. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. David Pahl : Thank you, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Kevin. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Your automotive business grew 23% in 2016, obviously very solid results. Can you guys just help us understand, of the five sub-segments within the auto, what areas drove the more strength? Kevin March : And as you noted, automotive did grow over 20%. The great news is that wasn\u2019t due to one segment. And I can see that that growth was very diverse, it was diverse across the five sectors that we saw. It was diverse across customers, and is also was very diverse across different product lines. So, we really are excited about the opportunity of both automotive and industrial, and we\u2019re just very pleased that the investments that we made are really kind of providing a base from which we can grow upon. Do you have follow on? Harlan Sur : Yes, I do. Thank you for that. If I look at the recent SIA industry data, total analog is likely to be up above 5% this year, above $47 billion -- in 2016, your analog business was up about 2% last year, but obviously the growth was impacted by a largest customer that have an inventory correction last year. If you shift this out, does the team think that they gained analog market share, and if so in which of the sub-segments? Thank you. Kevin March : I think that when we look at our peers with the publicly reported data, we actually believe that we\u2019ve performed quite well. So, we\u2019re probably earlier in the reporting season, so we\u2019ve got a few more to of our peers to put their numbers up. But we\u2019re very confident that we performed very well. So, thank you for that question. And we\u2019ll go to next caller please. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Chris Danely with Citi. Go ahead please. Chris Danely : Hey, thanks guys. And Kevin congratulations on the next Phase, thanks for being patient -- I think the real reason you\u2019re leaving is you\u2019ve got tired of winning for TI to hit my $12 stock price, so -- that\u2019s a joke for all of you who are listening. If you could just list, I guess, the margin drivers and maybe rank them from here as far as how much room or how much leverage you have in terms of mix versus 300 millimeter versus utilization rates versus depreciation? Kevin March : I hope not to revisit that $12 stock price you\u2019re talking about. Margin drivers, going forward, I think that there will be several things happening. I think we\u2019ve enjoyed the last couple of years. Depreciation coming down same time that 300 millimeter starts to be going up. And those sort of have been tailwinds for us in the last couple of years. As we go forward, depreciation is probably going to begin to flat out there on a quarter-over-quarter basis. They\u2019ll still be down next year versus 2016, but nearly as much that we\u2019ve seen. What's the lot more important is the continued expansion of 300 millimeter production, as well as the continued improvement of the mix of products that we are shipping. You heard us again talk for a number years about focusing our investments in auto and industrial. And frankly, the margin opportunities in those spaces are very attractive. And still between the mix of products, but importantly, the increasing starts of products on 300 millimeter capacity, there is still room for us to continue to see overall margin growth. And that\u2019s before we even talked about revenue growth, where this revenue growth just gives us leverage on that capacity that we\u2019ve been investing for these past couple of years. And with depreciation being as low as I was talking about, what that really means is under-utilization charges of negligible. And so really, it's just about fall-through from revenue straight to the bottom line, and that will especially happen to cash flow. Chris Danely : And so my follow-up longer term question on OpEx. So, if we look at year-over-year, your SG&A trended down a little bit. R&D was up. You guys have said you were going to -- little more money into R&D, assuming revenue continues to grow. What can we expect from R&D and SG&A on a yearly basis? Do you feel comfortable with the level of R&D as it is right here, and could we expect SG&A to continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue, assuming overall revenue growth? Kevin March : Yes, Chris. That\u2019s a really good question. The last couple of years OpEx has on annual base run about 23% of revenue, and as you noted we have been internally reallocated resources pretty more percent to the R&D areas. That will continue for next couple of quarters and begin to stabilize, and I would expect in 2017 all things being equal will still up at around 23% of OpEx of revenue. Keep in mind that -- we expect our OpEx to probably fluctuate between 20% and 30% on very weak markets and that'd be as high as 30%. And in very strong markets, I might be wrong as low as 20% kind of stable markets we're in right now. I think the OpEx percent you've seen in the last two years is what you expect to get forward for the next year or two. David Pahl : Right, thanks Chris. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : We'll go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Joe Moore : I wonder, if you talk about the change to the analog sub-segments as in particular Silicon Valley Analog is a category going only. Does that signify any from a business standpoint in terms of the integration of the old national business? Should we think if there being any structural change to goes along with that? Kevin March : It has nothing to do with analog business, that\u2019s simply a question of realigning our products to the way that we have come to understand and our customer preferred to look for them when they trying to find products here at TI. And so, if you look at the categories that we've lined up with up as Power, we have Signal Chain and we have High Volume Analog & Logic. And that\u2019s really how we have learned our customers preferred to sort of fine products at TI. And so that\u2019s allows us to give them better and faster support. The Silicon Valley Analog products along with High Performance Analog that's been reallocated among those segment of those new products lines that we've just talked about. So consequently, the best way to think about this is how do we react faster and more thoroughly to increase and searches for products in our portfolio. For the balance portfolio like ours, it's really important for us to be sure that we are aligned as efficiently as possible for customer to get to the parts they need more. Joe Moore : Okay, great that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s helpful thank you. And then just returning to the growth in autos, I guess we see the peer group is growing sort of high single digits maybe little bit better, so obviously you are growing quite a bit faster in autos than other analog companies. Should we think of that is being sort of sustainable gains? Or just how do you -- is anything you kind of help us understand why that was such a good number? And what should we expect going forward? Kevin March : Joe, this isn't -- as you know and you have been tracking our revenues inside of that market for some time. It's not something that is capping this quarter, right. We have been having very strong growth inside of automotive and that is a result of how we allocate capital. We have for some time been directing investments and increases both in automotive and industrial. And that\u2019s because we think that those are the two markets that are going to provide growth, not just for us but in our industry. So -- and as you know, these are long tail type of design wins and revenue strength. And we are very intentional as I mentioned earlier trying to direct our investments, so we are not just seeing growth in one sector or at one customer. So, that\u2019s what we are trying to do. So thanks for that question. We will go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll go next to Romit Shah with Nomura. Go ahead please. Romit Shah : Yes, Kevin, congratulations on your retirement, all the best. I wanted ask Dave, did you gave us channel inventory, how much supply your distributors are carrying in the quarter? David Pahl : I haven\u2019t but I would certainly can, inventory was even with the Eureco [ph] and decreased by about a half of week sequentially. And it's still running at around four weeks in the channel. And I just also have a reminder that that number benefits because of our consignment programs that we have in place with our distributors. Romit Shah : You guys talked about moderate growth again last year, but there has been I guess talk more recently about stimulus better GDP growth under the new administration. And I'm curious, how do you think your distributors would react under that scenario? Do you think it's -- do you guys think about it as your distributors restocking as a major driver for this year? Kevin March : Romit, I don\u2019t think that we're quite that precise on that kind of thinking as how distributors might react. We look at the talk of stimulus with some anticipation of the positive boost to the economy, but frankly we think it's probably too early to figure out what that might be and how might manifest it itself. A lot of that stimulus seems to be focused towards infrastructure, and so if in fact just wind up there that with the further benefit on our industrial portfolio. More important to us as to watch what's happening on the tax front, and hopefully we will finally get some tax relief out of Washington, which will be a significant benefit to our shareholders. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, Romit, I'll just add that if you look as I said inventory was even with where we ended last year, it was actually down sequentially. So reflected in our numbers really has no restocking inside of it. And I would just say that the inventory levels that they have, the inventory levels that we have, just reflect an environment where we've got good product availability. And because of our investments in capacity ahead of demand, if these things do show up and turn into more significant growth going forward, we're ready to be able to support that. So, thank you Romit and will go to the next caller please. Operator : We'll go next to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please. Ross Seymore : Thanks for letting me ask the question. And first Kevin congrats and to Rafael too congrats on the promotion. Looking at the Analog business in the fourth quarter Dave, it was up 10% year-over-year, but you said HVAL was flat. I was little surprised that that side being flat and the remainder must have been up a good 13% to 15% year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about what the drivers were that created such a delta between those segments? David Pahl : Yes, so I think if you look at year-over-year by end market, personal electronics was down slightly due to mobile phones. So, if you back out mobile phones the actually personal electronics was up slightly, so that was the main reason that we saw that. You could kind of see that inside of our Analog. And that weakness in mobile phones was not just inside of HVAL, but you've saw that to a lesser extent inside the Power. Ross Seymore : On the OpEx side of your equation, I know, Kevin, you answered some questions about the R&D remaining elevated. If we think in the first quarter traditionally that goes up for just beginning of the year reasons by about 5%. Is that about the right area we should think OpEx changing sequentially in 1Q or is it different issue due to that reallocation. Kevin March : No, I wouldn\u2019t expect anything particularly different. The reallocation is mostly coming out of SG&A as we go forward, so it's just the mix coming out of that. So, total OpEx will continue to increase as you know seasonally in first quarter because of the absence holidays in the fourth quarter as well as the annual pay and benefit increases that we fully across our company in first quarter. Operator : We'll go next to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Go ahead please. Stacy Rasgon : Around the gross margin drives particularly 300 millimeters, you seem to be talking about that is probably the biggest driver on a go forward basis structurally. Can you talk to about us in terms of where you are on 300 millimeter utilization versus a year ago particularly given the amount of extension that you are doing? How much I guess room do you still have to grow there? And how does that compare to where you were a year ago? Kevin March : Yes, Stacy, I think that we have talked about between Richardson factory, which we call RFAB and the PMOS6 in Dallas location. If combined, we have about $8 billion of revenue generating capacity in those factories combined. We have continued to increase starts meaningfully on 300 millimeter for analog. And that is really going to be picking up pace more and more the new products that we are released and are being released on 300 millimeter. And the economics as you all aware are very compelling, I mean the bottom line is the chip costs are about 40% less from 300 millimeters versus 200 millimeters. So, the total finished products about 20% less, which add meaningfully, not only to gross margins but especially free cash flow. So that\u2019s a small space, we want to repeat it. So, again our starts continue to increase, and we continue to have a lot of capacity available to us. But more importantly, we have a lot of new devices and the pipeline being released onto 300 millimeter, and that all coming together will probably continue to accelerate the rate of starts and therefore we also will get from that manufacturing market. David Pahl : I'll just add Stacy as a seamless plug for our capital management call. Rafael and I'll cover more that detail in our capital management call. Stacy Rasgon : For my follow-up, I want to touch a bit on the accounting changes, and it seems to be influencing both the earnings as well as the share count. The diluted share count went up this quarter for the first time, and for everybody it sounds like, it was boosted by 500 million shares or so like because of the accounting change. So how should we think about that I guess going to 2017? Is it still something like a $0.03 or $0.04 per quarter benefits that's going to sort of sustain kind of into perpetuity? And in terms of share count, was it sort of like a one-time step-up? And should we still think about shares declining going forward even given I guess the increased dividends to reduced buybacks? Kevin March : So, Stacy, just a little more background on this gap change, it's going to impact all companies beginning $11 implemented being in the first quarter 2017 reported. So, we are basically only adopted by one quarter. The idea is trying to help with the better comparability for 2016 or '17. That being said, it does cause reported earnings to increase because of this tax benefit. It also met medical requires you compete with your share count differently and so added about 5 million shares to the share count just complaint to new calculation rules. In 2016, had we applied to the same gap at the beginning of the year, it would have added $0.04 to the first quarter, $0.03 for the second quarter, $0.04 for the third quarter and added a penny to the fourth quarter for total of $0.13 for the year. The way that we would recommend that you model for purposes of analyzing a company going forward is somewhat we are doing and that is just look at what happened last year and used that same sort of assumption for next year. I am pretty sure that will wind up be in different when we close the books on those assumptions, but that\u2019s the best way to model. So consequently, we had $0.04 that would have occurred in the first quarter 2016, and the guidance that we just offered for the first quarter 2017 is included $0.04, and we would suggest as it same thing. David Pahl : Stacy, let me just add to that that are -- for looking at next year our commitment, our capital management strategy and the discipline execution of that strategy remains unchanged. Our target is to return all of our free cash to the owners of the Company. And with the dividend model that we announced last quarter, it provides a more reverse framework to adjust allocation between -- of that return between dividend growth and share repurchases. Operator : We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead please. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. And I wanted to wish congratulations and good luck to Kevin and welcome to Rafael. So my first question, I know it's early days, but can you share any views on impact from any potential borrowed tax rate change or conversely any lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate? What would TI do differently, if either of these two things were to happen? Kevin March : Vivek, this is very speculative at this stage because clearly you can see just from reported press, so there is difference with opinions as to what kind of tax policies to employ between the President and the Congress. So, I think it's little bit hard for us to be able to characterize what that might do. What I can say is that any form of relief will be beneficial directed to our shareholders because that will simply expand our free cash flow. And as Rafael just commented, our commitment remains as it has been, best to return on 100% of free cash flow to our shareholder through dividend and stock not buybacks. So, any form whether it's borrower tax adjustments or actual lowering of the overall tax brackets clearly will be beneficial to our shareholders, and I am looking forward to seeing that happen. David Pahl : You have follow on to that? Vivek Arya : Yes, thanks Dave. Last quarter, you mentioned that it's seems like it's been in at 3% to 4% growth, but then you grew 7% in Q4 and you are guiding to 10% plus in Q1. I understand part of it is probably just normalization at one of your larger customers. But what is driving the upside, is it sustainable? Are we now in a 7% plus growth or like what's the change this year to deter us from that kind of growth trajectory? Kevin March : Yes. So, first Vivek, I\u2019ll just point out that when we look at the overall microenvironment, we really don\u2019t see something that has significantly changed in sometime. So, we continue to believe that we're operating in a very similar microenvironment that we have, that we haven't been If you look at inside of the quarter, demand came in stronger, really across most markets in businesses. The only notable exception as I talked about before was personal electronic came in about as we expected. And to your point, we are seeing choppiness in particular markets. Some of that more recently has been driven by one large customer. You can go back to clock not too long ago into last year we saw some choppiness in comps equipment before that we had a PC, XP refresh cycle that came to an end. And none of those were really tighter the overall economy, there was just very specific things going on within specific market. So, that's really the environment that we thing that we're operating in now. So, thank you and we'll go to next caller please. Operator : Next is John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Go ahead please. John Pitzer : Thanks for letting me ask the question and I'll chime in with my congratulations to Kevin. Kevin, I guess my first question is just looking at the up margins on the embedded business. You did a great job throughout calendar year 2016, as you grew that business to drive leverage and upside to the operating margins, but there is still a pretty healthy gap between the up margins and embedded and those in Analog. Is that still just the matter of getting more scale in the embedded business? Or how do we think about those up margins closing overtime. Kevin March : John, I think that's quite I think about it is, but we have been talking about for number of years, which means you set up investments in that area in number of years back. And then we readjust the investments especially for the base stations marketplaces, and since then we think we've got the investment that was about right. So, it really is a question of continuing to get leverage from revenue grown. Falling always through to up margins you pointed up, but again what we focused on that falls through on a free cash flow, and that's a real focus. So, there is nothing inherent that keeps it from continuing to improve in fact I would not be surprise to see as the team there continue to improve on that as they to put me understand where leverage capability they have on the investment base they have right now. John Pitzer : Yes, this is my follow-on. I apologize for asking, but a lot of my questions were already asked and answered. But just on the other revenue line, maybe if you look at your revenue holistically overtime, it's become significantly less volatile but that other bucket has jumped around a lot on quarter-on-quarter. And Dave, let me be just give us some guidance from these levels how we should think about kind of seasonality or the cadence of the other rep going forward? David Pahl : Yes, I think if you look for -- look at it for the full year, it decreased 3% year-on-year. And as we talked about before when you look at the history, it had decline more or like in the mid-teens and that was primarily as the legacy wireless products had on loaned. And we expect kind of going forward that we would be somewhere in a mid-single digit decline. There is seasonality inside of the other business it's driven primarily by calculators, they have a very strong seasonality due to back to school and then we also have royalties inside there that can choppy every once in a while. So those are the types of things, but overall when you look at much like this year we saw a 3% decline just probably similar to what we would expect to see going forward. Operator : The next is the Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead please. Ambrish Srivastava : Kevin, congratulations on your next phase of life and you've been nothing but an absolute pleasure in all the dealings we have had to do, so thank you for that. My first question Dave is on the industrial business, auto is a great business for you, over the years you have been consistently outgrowing the industry, but automotive is a $4 billion business. And I think a year ago, I had given you not really a lot of hard time, but I had asked you why the business didn\u2019t grow last year? So that was in 2015, but you are growing this business again at a pretty decent rate almost 10%, so what are some of the areas that are driving that growth? David Pahl : Ambrish, actually, if you look at the actual numbers I know you are using the rounded numbers that we've gave you. It's more like the mid-single digit, so a growth for the Europe, for industrial '16 over '15, and it good to see, good solid growth there. When we look the down into the details of the 14 sectors, we actually did see growth in most of those sectors 14 year. So again it's kind of same comments and hit on the automotive we are just encouraged that our investments are really turning to that broad based growth. Do you have a follow-on Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : I did. On the consumer side in specifically in mobile would March quarters and be up year-over-year? And would consumer be up year-over-year? All I am trying to understand is if the indigestion you had a year ago is that was supposed to bear that it will last into March or its behind us. David Pahl : Yes, so we are careful try to give guidance on below the top line in any sector, but I think your instincts that will have easy compare because of the weakness we saw a year ago will probably be correct. We have got time for one last call please. Operator : Last question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please. Toshiya Hari : My first question is again on industrial and Dave I appreciate your comments about they're being broad based growth in the segment. But if I recall correctly, I think this is the second conservative quarter where you guys point to an improvement in the industrial market place. So just curious if there are any kind of specific regions or end market areas well that\u2019s kind of driving that infection and in the market and industrial? David Pahl : Yes, there is a -- we are seeing that really broad based growth across regions, across products and across those 14 sectors that we have got in it. So, we're real pleased with that growth. Do you have a follow-on Toshiya? Toshiya Hari : Yes, thanks Dave. This is a technical one. So the IP, the one-time benefit you guys saw in Q4 from your IP agreements. Is this one-time in nature? Or could we see this materialized again in future quarters? And also what the nature of the contractor or the agreement was for this? David Pahl : Yes, it included several agreements with the several different cross licensees, but the part of that was a sale of some IP assets, and that was recognized and restructuring other lines. And then the balance was settlement of past infringement that was recognized in the other income expense model. On an ongoing basis, it tends to be multi across license agreements. So, we would expect about $20 million of annual benefit for the foreseeable future as a result of agreement to these new intellectual property contracts. It's a roughly $20 million a year annual benefit going forward. David Pahl : And thank you all for joining us. Again please plan to join us for our capital management call on February 8th at 10 AM Central Time. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments first quarter 2017 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded, and at this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the first quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. Personal electronics also grew compared with a weak year-ago quarter. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 20% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.97 which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $795 million, and we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.7% of revenue, up from 29.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and our opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 20% due to growth in all three product lines, power, signal chain and high volume. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers by about the same amount. In our other segment, revenue declined $57 million from a year ago, primarily due to a move of royalties to OI&E, which Rafael will explain later. Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remains strong with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand continued to strengthen with broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew compared with a weak year-ago quarter. Communications equipment grew slightly from the year-ago and sequential periods. And then lastly, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, which are where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content, and that they will provide diversity and longevity of products which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.14 billion or 63% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 220 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $808 million or 23.8% of revenue, and on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.8% of revenue, in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Operating profit was $1.25 billion, or 36.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 41.4%, up from 36.6% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 29.9%, up from 25.7% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the first quarter was $997 million or $0.97 per share, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit that was not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $795 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 132, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $127 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.76 billion, up 9% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $534 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.22 billion or 30.7% of revenue. Free cash flow was 11% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In the first quarter, we paid $500 million in dividends and repurchased $550 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.76 billion in dividends or 42% of trailing 12-month free cash flow, which demonstrates the affordability and sustainability of our dividend growth. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter year on year for 52 consecutive quarters. In March, we retired $250 million of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.375 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.32%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the first quarter with $3.05 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses. Turning to our outlook for second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.89 to $1.01, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit. Before moving to Q&A, there are three changes that I want to explain to help you better understand our first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. The first is to remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted a new GAAP standard that impacts the accounting of taxes for stock-based compensation. While this adoption has no impact on our cash balance, it does result in a discrete tax item that impacts our effective tax rate and earnings per share. To help you model the tax rate and discrete tax items, I am sharing the quarterly assumptions and their impact. We will continue to report how our results differ from our guidance just as we did this quarter. To start with, our operating tax rate for 2017 is estimated to be about 30%, unchanged from previous guidance. This operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and it's what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer term models. Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $30 million, $20 million and $10 million in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2017 respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rates which include discrete tax items translate to about 28%, 29% and 30% in the second, third and fourth quarters respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models. If you do the math using these numbers, you will get an effective tax rate of 27% for the year. I advise you not to use 27% in any quarter as the size of discrete tax items vary quarter to quarter, particularly in first quarter. We will post a chart summarizing our assumptions for these discrete tax items as well as the retrospective impact of this new standard on our website at ti.com/ir. Hopefully providing these discrete tax item assumptions will be a good start in dealing with this new accounting standard. The second item is a GAAP standard that we adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires us to report certain pension costs in other income and expense, or OI&E, that were previously reported in OpEx and cost of revenue. This change is small, typically about $15 million of costs in a quarter, with about 70% coming out of OpEx and the balance out of cost of revenue. A chart summarizing these changes and their retrospective impact will be available on our website The last change is also effective first quarter of 2017 and impacts how we handle royalties. We will no longer recognize royalties in revenue. Instead, they will be recorded as income in other income and expense. As Analog and Embedded have become a much larger part of the company, royalties now represent a little less than 1% of our overall revenue. They were about $30 million in the first quarter of 2017, about what they were a year ago. We expect royalties to continue to run generally at about this level for many years into the future. However, given their decreasing significance to our core operations, they are now recorded as other income and expense rather than in revenue as of our first quarter 2017 results. I'm hopeful that spending some extra time talking through these accounting details will help you in understanding our results Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our first quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll take our first question in the queue. This will be from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution. From a product and end market perspective, it appears that demand is relatively broad based. I'm wondering if you can comment on demand by geographies. I'm assuming that that's also fairly broad based as well, but wanted to see if there were any regions which are exhibiting any weakness. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, Harlan. Yes, I would say that the demand was very broad based and included regionals. Year over year, revenue was up in Asia, Europe and the U.S. And revenue was about even in Japan from a year ago. You have a follow up? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, I do. Thanks for that. Auto, a solid market for the team last year with that end market up 23%. I think you mentioned that it's up double digits again in March. You've got a very diversified business here as well. There's been some concern around the global auto markets and the potential for a slowdown, given indications that production and/or demand after two solid years might start to slow. Just wanted to get the team's sense on the health of this market kind of near to midterm. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes. I definitely, as we stated in the opening remarks, that we saw our demand for our products in automotive continued to be strong. And so like you said, we've built that business across a very diverse set of sectors. And in fact, we've got five sectors inside of automotive. So it's diverse not only in the products that we sell into, but it's diverse across customers, across geos. So we feel very good about our position in automotive. And then over the medium and longer term, we think that our pipeline of designs continues to be very strong. And if you look at the average content in a car today, I think most people would put it somewhere between $350 and $400. That's roughly about 1%, or a little more than 1% of the sales price of a car. And I think a lot of analysts inside of a 10-year timeframe have that moving somewhere closer to 2%. So that's we continue to invest in it, and we're really pleased with the position that we've developed so far. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Thanks, Harlan. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll now move to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First I wanted to ask about OpEx. Did that come in in line with your original plan for the quarter or was it different? And how should we think about the OpEx trajectory into Q2? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes. Thanks for the call. I'll handle that one. On OpEx, everything came in about as expected. What I would tell you, the way you want to think about OpEx, high level, we've talked about our model where we want to run OpEx between 20% and 30% of revenue and in stable markets at the lower end of that, the lower half. And that's exactly what we've been doing for the last couple of years. And in fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we're just below that. So as you think forward, you should model us along those lines. If you're thinking kind of on a tactical level first to second, I would remind you that second quarter does have three months of higher pay and benefit raises versus only two months in first quarter. So you may have some of that played in kind of similar to what happened last year, maybe a little less than that. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Do you have a follow-on, Stacy? Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, yes I do. On your capital management update from a month or two ago, you had given some indicators of where 300-millimeter loading was, but it only went up a little bit in 2016. I think it went from about $2.2 billion year over year to $2.5 billion, so maybe $300 million, suggesting a good amount of headroom left for that transition to continue. How should we expect that trajectory to evolve this year in 2017? Is it just dependent on growth? Is there volume in 200-millimeter that's ramping down as 300-millimeter is ramping up? Like how should we think about where that might end up exiting this year in a normal demand environment? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yeah, Stacy, in the capital management update, if you remember, we talked about the fact that we've put in place about $8 billion of 300-millimeter capacity. Last year we had, as you stated, about $2.5 billion, so we're in a great position to be able to support growth. And essentially, we've been releasing for sometime now really probably going back to 2010, almost all of our new Analog products to 300-millimeter. So there's some exceptions to that, of course, on some older technologies that don't make sense to do, but the vast majority of them have been released there. So as you think about the Analog business growing, you can think of that incremental growth essentially being built on 300-millimeter. And if you look at last year, that came pretty close to what happened. So we had about $300 million of growth, so it's very consistent with that. So, thank you, Stacy, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll now move to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave, you were kind enough in your prepared comments to go through end markets in the March quarter on a year over year basis. I think the comm equipment was the only market you gave sequential color. I'm just curious if you can talk a little bit about the sequential growth into March. It was well above seasonal and sort of in the same vein, to your guidance in June, you're guiding below seasonal. So how should we think about that from an end market perspective? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Okay. So a couple of things. We thought the comms equipment market has been choppy in recent past, so we thought that that would be helpful, and that's why we provided it. If I'd just comment on the other markets sequentially, automotive market, as we said, continued to be strong. It increased with most of the sectors growing. Industrial demand was strong across almost every sector that we ship into. And just as a reminder, we've got 14 different sectors there. I won't put everybody to sleep by going through them, but we do have quite a number of sectors that are inside of that and literally hundreds of end equipment that fit inside of that. So it's very, very broad based. Personal electronics decreased. You usually see that seasonally. And then enterprise systems was about even. So, when we look at our guidance for second quarter, if we're looking at that sequentially, the low end of our guidance would suggest that revenues would be flat. The high end of the guidance suggests that it would be up 9%. And if you look at that, John, on a year on year basis, the low end would be up 4% and the high end would be up 13%. So we think that that's fairly robust growth inside of the second quarter. So you have a follow-on, John? John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes, that's helpful. And I guess as my follow-on, I might have missed this and I apologize, but did you give an orders number for the quarter? And just in general, how are lead times either of your products or your competitors' products, because there has been some buzz that perhaps lead times within the industry are starting to stretch out? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes. So orders were up 14% year on year to $3.5 billion. They were up about 2% sequentially. And I think from a lead time standpoint, our lead times have remained stable. And just as important as that, our on-time delivery metrics also remain very high. So our shipping to our commitments that we make to customers remain very high. So with that said, we do have some isolated process and package combinations where lead times have stretched, but we've worked very aggressively on those. So we're very pleased with where we are to be able to keep ahead of demand. Well thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll now move to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on inventory, Dave. I guess exiting the quarter, inventory days were at 132 days, toward the high end of your guided range. How comfortable are you with that level? And what are you seeing in terms of the distribution channel? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, we are \u2013 well, I'll answer our inventory days and then I'll let Dave comment on the disti channel. But we're comfortable with our inventory days. It's well within our range. Always remember inventory days is a backwards looking metric, so what we have it there for is to support growth. And the other key point to remember is as we have focused our strategy more on industrial, automotive and on catalog type of parts, the risk of obsolescence on this part is really minimal. So it makes sense from a longer-term standpoint to have that inventory available to support revenue growth. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, and from a disti standpoint, Toshiya, we saw our inventory days kind of remain near their current levels, at four weeks. That benefits from our consignment programs we have with our distributors. It actually was down sequentially, and it was down from a year ago. So we think that those are in good shape. Do you have a follow-on? Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on M&A. You guys have been pretty consistent in the past, and you've pointed to valuation and the lack of opportunities as reasons to stay sidelined, but was hoping you could potentially give us an update there, if any changes. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, I'd be happy to comment. The update is no change. It's the same strategy for M&A. We looked at \u2013 we're always considering options and looking at things, but it has to be an opportunity that is focused on industrial, it's focused on automotive, catalog type of parts, Analog catalog. So it has to be a good strategic fit from that standpoint. But then the other component that has to be there is that the numbers have to make sense. So when we have both of those combinations, then we are willing to move forward on considering that further. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Thank you, Toshiya. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll move now to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Couple questions from me as well. I guess one, fairly impressive growth in the Analog side. I think it was up like 20% year over year. Is there a way to think about the growth in the segment excluding the consumer side, where I think you may have had somewhat easier comps? Just trying to get a sense of what the baseline number could be on Analog as you go through the year. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes. I think first of all, let me just make a comment at the company level. We talked about that the demand was driven from the strength that we saw in the industrial market as well as automotive. That represented about 70% of the growth, and certainly we did benefit and see growth inside of personal electronics off of the easy compare, as we all remember a year ago that we were working through an inventory correction in that particular end market. So the great news is that's very consistent with what we saw inside of Analog, and so the growth is very, very broad based. So we've got contributions from the industrial market, contributions from the automotive market, and as well as we did see contributions from the personal electronics market. So do you have a follow-on? Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I do. I guess just in the automotive segment, could you just talk about if there's a way to think about maybe what percent of your auto revenues today are infotainment-centric versus more mandate driven around fuel efficiency or battery management or safety? And is there a way to think about the geographic split in the auto business as well? Thank you. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yeah, thanks. That's a great question, Amit, and thanks for the opportunity to comment on it. You know, I think that the great thing that we've been trying to do, or the thing that we've been trying to do and why we're happy with the results, is that our automotive business isn't just built on just either infotainment or an ADAS business. It really is broad based. So when we look at kind of the order of the sizes of those business, the infotainment is the largest. Safety systems is the second, followed by advanced driver assist systems, then power train, which includes hybrid and electric and then body, electronics and lighting. So, and if you dive into any one of those areas, it's not dominated by one technology or one product. And we've got more than half of our 60 to 70 product lines that ship products into the automotive business. So we're very diverse from a product standpoint. We're also very diverse from a geography standpoint as well, so we're really seeing a benefit and additional revenue growth from all of the geos. So thank you, Amit. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : At this time, we'll move to C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Apologies for, I guess first question, I got on a little bit late, so just have a point of clarification. In terms of the royalty commentary, the $30 million, was that included for Q1 as well? So net-net with that, top line would have been $30 million in gross margin, 100% of that $30 million better? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : And then from here, we should be using that same amount? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : So the change in royalties was included in our guidance, meaning that the royalties were in other income and expense, just like how they came in in results. And on a go-forward basis, they will stay in other income and expense. So for modeling purposes, you can look at how that other income and expense line came in and then model it similar to that on a go-forward basis. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. And I guess as a follow up, can you walk through some of the work that you're doing on the gross margin side? It sounds like internally, the 75% is not enough and you want to take that higher. And would love to hear what you're working on, and I'm assuming that includes not only front end but back end manufacturing and would love to get an update there, if you could. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, sure. As you think of the company on a go forward basis, the biggest driver of our gross margin is revenue, revenue growth. And that's what we're focused on industrial and automotive. Those are the best opportunities that we have ahead of us because of the constant growth of semiconductors in those spaces. Now, beyond revenue growth, then we have 300-millimeter manufacturing, the efficiency of our manufacturing, particularly with 300 millimeter. As you probably recall from the capital management strategy, I walked through why 300-millimeter is such a competitive advantage, and that's because the cost of the chip is significantly less. In fact, it's 40% less at the chip level than on 200-millimeter. So what that translates to is not just higher gross margin but more importantly, higher free cash flow, And then free cash flow per share that we can return to the owners of the company. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Okay. Thank you, C.J., and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And the next question will be Chris Danely with Citi. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, guys. I'm going to use up my first question on just a couple of revenue clarifications. So in response to an earlier question on the, I guess the stronger than expected revenue, so are you telling us that your automotive business was responsible for the upside in Q1 on revenue and comm was a little weak? And then on the Q2 guide, you're basically guiding up like 4.5%. That's below seasonality and also below what you guided sequentially for last year. So you're not seeing any weakness or no change in the Q2 forecasts over the last like month? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes. So the first is that our revenue came inside of our guidance, and so we didn't really have any surprises there. If you look at all of the businesses and if you look at the end markets, we really saw strength across the board, Chris. So there really wasn't an area that we would point to that singularly drove the revenues in the quarter or from the midpoint of the guidance, if you will. So very broad based overall. And then secondly, again, I think going back to John's question, when we look at our sequential growth rates of kind of the low end of flat to up 9% or on a year on year basis of 4% to 13%, we think that that's a pretty strong second quarter. So do you have a follow-on? Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Just a longer-term question. I think you've talked about currently being outfitted for somewhere around $18 billion in revenue capacity. What sort of revenue level would you start to need to order more equipment? I assume you wouldn't wait until you're 100% utilized before you start to put those orders in. Is it 90% utilization, 95%? Maybe give us some color there. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Well, I'll give you some color and then I'll let Dave chime in. But, we think of our strategy, as stated in the capital management strategy for many years, is that we want to add capacity well ahead of demand. And that's because this is an asymmetrical bet. This capacity we can buy. When we buy that way, we can buy used equipment and we can buy it at pennies on the dollar where the carrying cost is minimal but the upside potential is tremendous for the reasons that I talked about earlier and the great fall through that we get to free cash flow. So we're thinking longer term, 10, 15 years out when we're making capacity decisions. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, and I'll just add, Chris, like you pointed out, we had a little over $13 billion in revenue last year. We've got just under about $6 billion of open 300-millimeter capacity. We have open 200-millimeter capacity inside of that footprint. So we've got plenty of room to grow for some time. But like Rafael said, if we had the opportunity tomorrow to buy another wafer fab or make a large purchase and it was at the right price, we'd make that move, because it is an asymmetrical bet. So thank you, Chris, and we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : We'll now move to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and maybe I'll ask the same related question here. When you look at the guidance, well actually if you just look at the overall business, you're not the only ones seeing double digit year over year growth in all of your businesses. Even if you've taken out personal electronics, the rest of the business is up strong. And the commentary actually suggests that it remains strong. So I guess kind of two parts here. One, how do you foot the gap between what, I know there is content gains in semis, but between what some of the end markets are doing, what's your perspective as you look out the rest of the year? Do you think the semi market is a little ahead of itself? And then I guess as you look at your June guidance, did you guys apply any sort of conservatism to that guidance to account for anything along those lines? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, so I think if you walk through the end markets, Blayne, as we've commented, automotive has remained strong. You saw that that business last quarter had grown at over 20%. It's been growing very strongly for some time. And again, that business and that growth isn't built on just one OEM or one car model or one end market. So it's very, very diverse, and we feel good about that positioning. When you look at the industrial market, that strength has continued to build. So we're seeing that come in nicely. We already talked about the personal electronics markets and some of the other markets in detail. So again, that strength, and as you pointed out, is broad based. Others are seeing it as well. So kind of on the other thing is, to your question, are we double ordering or seeing inventories build. I'd just make the comment that overall the economy does feel a little stronger than it did a year ago. However, it's really still to be seen to what extent will we see this growth over a longer period of time. So, we have no indications that inventories are growing or double ordering, but I'll also point out that history suggests that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think it's important to qualify what we can see. I mentioned earlier our lead times have remained stable. When you look into inventory, we've got good visibility into distribution inventory, and as I commented earlier, that remains steady, about four weeks. It's down sequentially. It's down from a year ago. So we think that's in real good shape. Our visibility into customer inventories really varies depending on if they're on consignment or not. So on consigned OEMs, we've got great visibility into their inventory because we're holding it on our books, actually our inventory, and they pull it only when they need it. And we're not seeing any unusual signs there, so things like expedites and things like that that would suggest that there's an issue overall. And our visibility into inventory, of course beyond our customers' manufacturing operations and down in their channels, of course is very low. So, as we have been doing for a long time with our manufacturing, our internal inventory strategies, we'll just stay focused on keeping lead times steady, and delivery metrics very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence, that they can get support from us when they need it. Do you have a follow-on? Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great and I apologize. I missed the very beginning, so if you already said this, I apologize. But in terms of your guidance, I kind of get gross margins flattish, maybe down a little bit. I just wanted to make sure that that's the right range. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : The way I would comment on that is, we have said before that our revenues fall through between 70% and 75%. So if you do that math on a sequential basis, you'll get somewhere close to where you need to be. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Okay. Thank you. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : I'm sorry. We'll take a question now from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks very much. You talked about how your investment priorities were in industrial and automotive. Can you give us some idea within automotive, are there specific types of products or specific capabilities that you're directing your investments at? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, David. As I mentioned before, we're very intentionally trying to make investments across a very broad number of areas. So they include things that are very popular like ADAS systems and infotainment systems, but also embody electronics and lighting. So we've commented before that that includes areas like turn signals. There's a couple of dollars of content in an LED turn signal and our sales teams get pretty excited about things like that. But also sensors on door handles and inside of the infotainment system, the touch buttons to control the AC or the audio system, haptic systems that may sit inside of the steering wheel or in driver's seats, and LED lighting inside of a car. There's a lot of areas. So we're really trying to direct that investment to be very, very broad based. Do you have a follow-on, David? David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Well, similarly for industrial, you mentioned the 14 areas you were going to bore us with. Are there any additional areas on top of the 14 that you will be able to go into because of your investments? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, so I'll resist the temptation to bore you and run you through those. But if I just take one like Medical, as an example, that sits inside of there, there's literally hundreds of end equipment that will sit inside of medical. And if you think of at the high end, there may be a magnetic resonance imaging machine that may sell for millions of dollars, and then all the way down at the other end, you have a blood glucose meter that may sell for less than $50. So we actually have over 100 different end equipments that will sit inside of a sector like medical, and as we make investments, we look to funnel those investments, not just in one area like something like factory automation and control, as an example. We really want to funnel those investments on a very broad basis. So thank you, David, and we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll now move to Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you. My first question on lead times. So you mentioned your lead times are very stable. You're maybe seeing some stretch in certain specific areas. But if you look at the general environment, does it feel like the supply chain is overly nervous about getting product, or does it feel like it's pretty controlled? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, Tore. Again, I can really only speak for what we see and what we're doing. And again, I think we're advantaged because we've got a large portion of our revenues on consignment, so we're actually controlling that inventory up and to the point that it gets pulled. We also, for many customers, we'll get long-term forecasts. Those consignment forecasts literally sometimes can be on an hourly basis, but certainly on a daily or weekly basis and typically go out for six months in some cases. Now that doesn't mean that they can't change very quickly, and we've seen that before in the past and they can strengthen or weaken and that usually happens very quickly. So again, our lead times are remaining very stable besides those isolated areas that we're working very aggressively to fix. The vast majority of our products remain stable. Do you have a follow-on, Tore? Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. That's very helpful. As a follow up, I think you mentioned industrial strengthening. So I assume that means it's going to be up more in June than it was in March. And again, is that strength broad based, or is there any region that's waking up a little bit more than others? And I'm especially thinking about China, because there's been some recent weakness there. I'm just wondering if that region is holding up as well in industrial. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yeah, Tore, the comment was around the quarter that we reported, and we've seen industrial strengthen now for a number of quarters in a row. Our guidance for the second quarter, we just provide the top level and EPS. If there is anything that's unusual going on in an end market, we always provide that color to be helpful. And we haven't had to provide that obviously for second quarter. So thank you, and I think we've got time for one more caller, please. Operator : The question will be from with Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had a question on R&D and as it relates to OpEx. Rafael, you kind of articulated that the OpEx will be in the band that you have provided in the past, so no change there. But R&D on a year over year basis in absolute dollars has been growing, and in your last filing, you mentioned that you would be reallocating from manufacturing as well as SG&A into R&D. So just kind of like a two-part question is, one, what should be the trajectory of R&D as we model through the year? And then kind of related to that, qualitatively if you could help us understand where the focus is for the R&D investment. Thank you. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes. Let me address the second part of that question first. That's clear, we've been focusing on industrial and on automotive. That's where we have been biasing our investments for a number of years, and that's why we're getting strong results in both of those end markets. Now over half of our revenue is coming from industrial and automotive, so those investments are paying off. On your first part of your question, I would take you back to my earlier comments. We like, our stated goal or model is 20% to 30% OpEx. I know you're asking about R&D, but we like to look at it as OpEx because there are a lot of pieces there that we think of as investments, investments in sales, in the sales force, in ti.com, and a few other things that help us build those competitive advantages. So OpEx 20% to 30% in stable times, in the bottom half of that, so 20% to 25%, and we have been running like that for now 27 months. So you should think about that way when you're modeling our OpEx. Dave, you want to add? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, I'll just add, Ambrish. As you know, when we look at making investments, whether it's in R&D or in OpEx, as we pointed out in our capital management presentation that we gave earlier, investing in the businesses is a top priority. So, and what we're try to do, as Rafael indicated by market, but we also want to strengthen our four competitive advantages. So those include the first one which is manufacturing and technology, ensuring that we're developing great process technologies and strengthening our position with 300-millimeter. The breadth of the portfolio is the second, and we've talked about that a lot and how that plays out through industrial and automotive. The third is the reach of our marketing channels and strengthening that, and that continues to be our investments in ti.com as well as how that's coupled with our sales force and apps teams. And then we want all those things to lead to the diversity and longevity, and that will lead to good free cash flow per share growth, and that's really what we want to do. Did you have a follow-up? Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): No, that was it. Thank you very much. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Okay. Well thank you all for joining us tonight and a replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : And again, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for your participation.",

Riley Financial Operator : Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter '17 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I\u2019ll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue in the second quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continue to strengthen in the industrial market. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 18% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.03. With that backdrop, I\u2019ll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI\u2019s business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $917 million. We believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.0 billion, and free cash flow margin was 28.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned 4.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 18% primarily due to growth in power and signal chain each of through about the same amount, high volume also grew. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 15% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers by about the same amount. In our other segment, revenue declined $60 million from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Now, I\u2019ll provide some insight into this quarter\u2019s revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remains strong with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand continued to strengthen with broad-based growth as most factors grew double digit. Personal electronics grew while results vary by customer. Lastly, communications equipment grew and enterprise systems was about even. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets which for the end markets where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on our belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content, and that they will provide diversity and longevity of products which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.37 billion or 64.3% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 300 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $812 million and on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.3% of revenue, which is in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Operating profit was $1.48 billion, or 40.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 31% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 44.7%, up from 38.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing was 31.2%, up from 25.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second quarter was $1.06 billion or $1.03 per share, which included $28 million discrete tax benefit above what we expected. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $917 million in the quarter. You will see that while net income was significantly higher than a year ago, that increase was more than offset by a higher tax payment that was driven by our outlook for higher profitability this year. Inventory days were 133, even with our year ago and within our range. Capital expenditures were $151 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis cash flow from operations was $4.56 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $527 million or about 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.04 billion or 28.5% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In the second quarter, we paid $498 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.15 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.05 billion. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.88 billion in dividends. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.2% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. This combine returns of dividend and repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and commitment to return excess cash to our owners. In the quarter we retired $375million of debt and year-to-date, we have retired $625 million. In addition, we issue $600 million in debt in two branches, $300 million each in four year and seven year notes. This leads total debt of $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the quarter with $2.98 billion of cash and short-term investment, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses. Turning to our outlook for third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.04 to $1.19, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. Our annual operating tax rate for 2017 is now about 31%, compared with our prior expectations of above 30% due to our outlook for higher profitability this year. This annual operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and it's what you will need to use at the starting point for your longer term model. Next, we're assuming discrete free tax items of about $20 million and $10 million in the third and fourth quarter of 2017 respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rate which include discrete tax items translate to about 29% and 30% in the third and fourth quarter respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models. I will also remind analyst who are beginning to work with 2018 model that we would expect the discrete tax benefit in 1Q '18 to be higher than what we\u2019re projecting for the third and fourth quarter of 2017, but lower than 1Q '17. To estimate the 2018 annual operating tax rate start with 2017 PDP tax of 31% than apply a 35% tax rate to any incremental profit. Then model discrete tax benefits by quarter, knowing that first quarter is expected to be higher than the others. Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long-term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our second quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Unidentified Analyst : This is Jerald, on behalf of Ross. Just one question from me. You detailed how your end markets change year-on-year. Could you provide some details on how you estimate they change quarter-on-quarter? Rafael Lizardi : Sure, Jerald. For automotive, basically, it increased sequentially with all sectors growing. Industrial, again, we saw a very broad based growth across the sectors and overall it also increased. Personal electronics increased with most sectors growing. Communications equipment was about even sequentially and enterprise systems are showing also good growth. Do you have a follow-on? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, sure. So you talked in the past about R&D potential is being a little bit elevated in near term now you guys came in further to our model for the quarter. How much longer could R&D be elevated in order to invest in the business? Dave Pahl : I'll take that first. I would point out that I know you are asking about R&D, but let me address it from on OpEx standpoint. We look at that OpEx as a model and our model is turning to be between 20% and 30% of revenue I mean stable times to be at the lower half of that in fact that's why we've been in the last 2.5 years here so, 23 to 22, now we are running at 22% of revenue and again in stable times we think we can operate there. Now, inside of that they are both in R&D and actually in SG&A, we have various investments that are strengthening our competitive advantages on the R&D front. We continue to focus on industrial and automotive to broad -- continue broaden portfolio. On the SG&A side, we invested on to increase the reach of our channels ci.com in particular we are thinking that we are going to continue to make those investments to strengthen the Company. Rafael Lizardi : Okay, great and we will go to our next caller please. Operator : We will go now to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Adam Gonzalez : Hi, thanks, this is Adam Gonzalez on for Vivek. First question, maybe could you contrast auto demands now versus say maybe six months ago? Anyhow industrial is an even larger market where you guys even though auto tends to get all your attention. Just wondering, did it correlate at all? Can industrial offset any potential demand fluctuations in autos? Thanks and have follow-up. Dave Pahl : Sure, yes. So, the strength that we've seen inside of automotive is something that we've seen for probably greater than four years now. So, I'd attribute that to our early focus on that market, the breadth of our technologies and really just the overall diversity of our position. We\u2019ve got five sectors inside of automotive that we are in investing in. So that includes infotainment safety systems, ADAS or advance driver assist systems, power train, which includes EV and hybrid and body electronics and lighting. So we are seeing good growth across those comms vectors that sit inside of the automotive market. And really also diversity, across sub-system suppliers, across car companies, across geographical regions, so we feel really good about that, very similar story inside of industrial very broad-based growth. I won\u2019t to speak to whether they'll be connected through economic cycles are not, but both do have increasing content. So, I\u2019d be a little cautious to think that increasing content could offset correction that we may see in a near-term in any one given quarter or even in any one given year. But we believe that there will be more content there over the long-term when you\u2019re looking five and 10 years and that\u2019s why our investments are higher today. Do you have a follow on? Adam Gonzalez : My second question is more on your free cash flow growth. I\u2019m just curious why if you look at on a trailing 12-month basis, why free cash flow hasn't grown year-on-year despite your core NOI embedded businesses growing into low double-digit range? And what\u2019s the catalyst for maybe getting that back to the higher single-digit maybe low double-digit range? Thanks. RafaelLizardi: Yes, thanks for -- this is Rafael. Thanks for a chance to clarify that. First, in any given quarter, you're going to have puts and takes on free cash flow -- on in line with the P&L, but particularly on the cash flow -- on the cash flow statement. In this particular quarter and also on a trailing 12-month basis, but what you see there is we had an increased tax payment in 2Q \u201917, that was primarily due to our outlook for higher profitability this year. Dave Pahl : Okay. And we\u2019ll go through the next caller please. Operator : We will take our next question from Chris Danely with Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- excuse me with Citigroup. Chris Danely : I had a question on gross margin. So your revenue is basically back to it was in the third, well I guess little bit higher than it was in the third quarter last year, but the gross margins are 230 basis points higher. Can you just kind of give us the reasons why they are higher? And then what would be the gross margin drivers going forward? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, sure. I'll be happy to address that. So, our gross margins in second quarter of \u201917 ended at 64.3% and that was 300 basis points higher than in the same quarter last year. And as you reflect the quality of our product portfolio, as we continue to focus on automotive and industrial, but also the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy and as you know, we have the unique advantage of having 300 millimeter factory that at the chip level provides 40% cost advantage. As of 2016, we had about 2.5 billion of our revenue running to 300 millimeter and as we continue to grow the Company, and in this case the Analog in particular, and that growth primarily runs through 300 millimeter then we're going to accrue that benefit over and over and it's a cumulative benefit that really yield some nice results. Through the gross margin line about in more important to their free cash flow and free cash flow for share to for the owner of the Company. Dave Pahl : Do you have follow-up, Chris? Chris Danely : Another thing that's going on out there at least some of your competitors have talked about their lead time extending. Is that happening at all at TI? Rafael Lizardi : Chris, I described our lead times continuing to remain stable, if we do have pocket where we got a processor package, supply tightness, but we\u2019re aggressively working those. But overall our lead times continue to remain stable. Dave Pahl : Okay thank. We'll go to go the next caller. Operator : We will go next to William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein : It's sort of a follow-up to the last one. We\u2019ve heard quite a bit about shortages for complimentary products SME's in particular on the faster aside. And I'm hoping you find out, if TI is seeing any sort of tapping of its growth opportunities because customers are certainly not going to order, parts if you think they can get a full kit from all their supplier racing that dynamic play at all. Rafael Lizardi : I would say in general, I'm not sure we could see that if that was there. But I'll just remind you that about 60% of our revenues are on consignment, so we got no inventory of our products sitting in front of the customer's production line that they owned. We may have position that one of our balance sheet and same thing with distributors but we actually do get demand forecast from them and those often times will be several months out, sometime even as far as six months out. And that doesn\u2019t mean that they can't change. And I would say for that where we do have very good visibility and won't see anything unusual going on inside of there, no one usual expedites or cancellations or those types of things. Do you have follow on? William Stein : Maybe you could comment on order linearity through the quarter and book to bill? Rafael Lizardi : Sure, so again, I\u2019ll make the comment that we\u2019ve got 60% of our revenues on consignment, so there we actually don\u2019t have orders or backlogs, we only see that those demand forecast. So book to bill is less helpful inside of that but orders if you look at through the month, they were strong overall and they did accelerate as we went through the quarter and into the month of June. Book to bill overall was 1.06. So and with that, we will go to the next caller please. Operator : We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur : Solid job on the quarterly execution margin expansion on the outlook, clearly macro dimensions are strong in yearend markets similar to our last quarter. I'm just wondering, if you could just talk about some of the dimensions from a geographic perspective. I think last quarter you guys saw year-over-year growth in of geographies, wondering, if you can just provide us with some details on the June quarter? Rafael Lizardi : Sure. Harlan. Year-over-year revenue was up in all regions so Asia, Europe and the U.S. and Japan on a year-over-year basis and that was true additionally on a sequential basis. So we saw growth very really across the board there and just as a reminder some of those as well some don\u2019t that the we attract our revenue on where we ship it, so it's not where that product is ultimately keeps in as so we may ship in to a car manufacturer or Tier 1 car manufacturer in Europe and -that's car may end-up and be sold in China as an example. So, it's really is not a good look through for end consumption by market. Do you have a follow-on? Harlan Sur : Yes, I do. Thanks for the color there. So on embedded strong year-over-year growth in sales. I think your operating profitability was up something like almost 600 basis points year-over-year. Is this mostly leveraged on the OpEx as you drive revenue growth? Or are there some positive mix benefit? And I'm not sure for example if some of your processes solution is going into automotive carry like higher gross margin profile? Rafael Lizardi : Well, this is Rafael. What I would tell you that the driver the main driver of what you are seeing near is the revenue growth as we have a over a number of years now we've refocused our investments in embedded and now that really being up very nicely. They have embedded has a quite a bit of our investment there is in automotive and industrial just like it is in Analog and then those as we have said those are the best markets and there is that's giving very nice results. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Harlan, and will go to our next caller please. Operator : We will take our next question from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : I guess two questions from me as well. First off historically that you've always talked about this 30 to 40 basis points of share gained actually on an annual basis. I'm just wondering given the inflection of R&D high over the last several quarters now, should we start to think about share gains potentially accelerating or share gains happening in place where the margin profile is much richer? And when do you see those benefits transfer for you guys on the revenue line? Dave Pahl : Well, I'll take a shot at that and if Rafael wants to add something, he can jump in. I would just say that as we look and allocate R&D, worth allocating those to the best projects that we can find one so that we are going to produce, it get designed into the most customers into the most market and have longevity of revenue. And really mostly that's about finding better opportunities to invest in and trying to just settle the number of products as an example that we're doing. But we have found more opportunities to make investments its things as our products will live longer and repurpose products into adjacent markets that we found opportunities to be able to do that. So and I think just in general the quality of the opportunity share doesn\u2019t shift very quickly. And so we are not penciling in an inflection point inside of our revenue. But when you look at our competitive advantages and -- I just say, just as a reminder, all four those together and the investments that we are making, and that includes the manufacturing and technology, the most visible one there is the 300 millimeter advantage that we have. The broader portfolio and just the tens of thousands of products that we\u2019ve got the opportunity to sell more products to customers the reach of the channel market including ti.com that Rafael had mentioned earlier as well as our sales force. And then just the diverse in line with positions, all those working together, I think this is confidence that in the -- in the future that we can continue to gain share in that range 30, 40 basis points. Rafael Lizardi : The only thing, I would add is, as you know we talk about it quite a bit we\u2019ve been focusing on our industrial for quite some time now because they\u2019ll start advance, there\u2019s kind of benchmark that they have the highest semiconductor content growth. And we are confident that will continue to have that for -- for many years to come. So as of the end of last year 51% of our \u2013 of our revenue was automotive and industrial and obviously with the growth we are seeing year-to-date that number appears to be picking up that percentage. So that numbers increases and we continue drive in a performance on those two segments. Then mathematically overall revenue will do better. Dave Pahl : Amit, do you have follow-on? Amit Daryanani : I do and hopefully I don\u2019t jinx the strength right now. But last four quarters I think all you guys have been pretty much at the high end of our revenue guide that you guys initially provide. Is there a change in the way you provide guide? Or you rolled up the revenue forecast that things have actually ended up at the high for four quarters in a row? Or is it just happened to be the case? Rafael Lizardi : It\u2019s really the later, when we look at the out quarter, again we\u2019ve got 60% of the revenues that we don\u2019t have patterns to look at, but we can actually seeing the demand patterns that that our customers have. And that can move in both directions pretty quickly, right. So even though we got great visibility there, things can strengthen or we can very quickly on us. But we do have very, very good visibility for that 50% of our revenue. And rest of that we look at, we do look at the backlog, we look at order patterns and our sales teams provide forecast as well. So, we go through our bottoms up and tops down approach. So, the revenue guidance that we gave for the third quarter is our best estimate of what we think we\u2019ll do. Okay. Dave Pahl : Okay, thank you, Amit. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Rafael, I apologize if I missed this. But, what I think just talk a little bit about OpEx trends going into the September quarter, typically, it\u2019s a seasonally down quarter for OpEx. I\u2019m just kind of curious, is that how we should be thinking about modeling it this September? Or are there some incentive or variable bonus offset that might actually have OpEx flat or up sequentially? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, I\u2019ll be happy to add some clarity on that. As you know, we don\u2019t guide specifically on OpEx or GPM, any line for that matter, matter other than revenue and EPS. But on OpEx -- and I should say, on OpEx we focus on the model, the 20% to 30%. And we\u2019ve been operating in the lower half of that. So we like, you guys to think a lot that way. I would tell you though if we had anything unusual going on an OpEx, we would point that out second to third and we do not. And we also don\u2019t have anything like vacation or compensation adjustment that sometimes or we do see fourth to first for example. We do not have that going on in a second to third concession. Dave Pahl : Just add to that when you look at our history we had some restructuring in the last few third quarters that you may have seen that transition that Rafael stated. There is not a seasonal impact you see inside the third quarter typically. Do you have a follow-on, John? John Pitzer : Dave, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the auto market because clearly over the last several year, it's been one of the better semis, but there have been some sort of mix data points, starts decelerating, you've seen some auto manufactures actually coming forecast in the back half of the year. So I guess how do you think about kind of solid unit growth versus content growth? And how is the visibility there? And are you seeing things that others might have highlighted last week on their conference call? Dave Pahl : Yes, so the one thing that been clear, our business has grown a very strong for four years plus now, so and that\u2019s really due to the early investments that we had made inside of this market, we continue to make. And again we're trying to ensure that we're making those investments as broad as we can, so we're not ending on one particular technology or one type of portion of that demand that\u2019s increasing. And clearly I don\u2019t think it's well know that actually content has grown faster inside auto's and if you go down into a showroom you can see that pretty clearly in any car today versus even just a few years ago. So we\u2019re confident that that trend will continue and we've also seen the announcements, like you've mentioned that some car companies have reduced their bill plan, we certainly continue to monitor those markets overall but we're confident in our long-term position there and we will continue to make those investments. Okay thank you John and we will go to the next caller please. Operator : We will now to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Sorry about that straddling two calls and I apologize if this has been answered already. In the reported quarter, did the upside comp versus your expectations going into the quarter? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, Ambrish, it was -- things were pretty strong, really across the board. So, we saw growth really in most market, most geographies and even lot of the sub sectors inside of automotive and industrial. Dave Pahl : And with that, three quarters of our growth came from industrial and automotive. So that just shows you how strong those were. Ambrish Srivastava : Yes, I did Dave, and this is you're kind enough always when we have this topic comes up every couple of quarters and not surprisingly we're in an economic expansion for a while now, top of the cycle. You have metrics that you look out with your cancellations, booking and so you share them quite frequently with us. So where are we, where is TI's on those metrics Dave. Thank you. Dave Pahl : I would say that if you look again inside of distribution, our inventory there remains at about four weeks is actually down sequentially and down from a year-ago. Our visibility in the customers inventory is of course very depending on if for on consignment or not so with our consigned OEMs were not thinking things that's unusual there such as expedite that would suggest that we have an issue, and off course our visibility and the inventory beyond with customers manufacturing operations is very little overall, so again cancellations remained low lead times continues to remain steady. So all of those metrics I think really our very similar to what we saw 90-days ago. So I think you Ambrish and I think we have time for one more call. Operator : We will go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley Financials. Craig Ellis : I wanted to come back on the gross margin point so congratulations on getting to 64% in the quarter. When I look at the incremental for the quarter, it was 79%, which is above the 68% to 69% level but that it had been for the last five or six quarters, not unprecedented but look like a step-up. Is that something we should interpret as being more sustainable? Or were there some either mix items or other lumpy 300 million transition items that contributed to be atypical surge in the quarter? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, this is Rafael. Well, we would tell you any given quarter the follow through will be a little different. In our company the size of ours are there is just a lot of puts and takes inside this big P&L the more important thing to remember is that we have some fundamental structural drivers that are have increased our GPM percent and we think we are in a continue increasing our GPM percent for a forcible future. And those are the quality of their portfolio as we continue to focus on the best market that are more even an industrial and the diversity and possessions and long live possessions that we get with those where we invest our R&D today and we get the revenue for decades to come. And then the other piece is 300 millimeter Analog as stated earlier that is 40% more cost efficient than 200 millimeter. And that accurse me and you starting one part on that and then in the next part you started on 300 and the third part and the fourth part and you making it all a bigger percent in terms of your company's is running on 300 millimeter and it was only the 30% as of 2016 and the 30% of the capacity we have on 300 which used. So we have ample room to continue growing 300 millimeter and accrue benefits to the Company. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow on? Craig Ellis : Yes, thank you. Just regarding the end market color you provided in response to earlier question Dave. Comps are going to be flattish quarter-on-quarter. Can you just what pressure maybe in terms of where that the Company stands with respect to how it's looking at comps from a strategic standpoint and where you see demand is as we look around and look at 4G infrastructure investments being made globally? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Sure. Yes, so comps equipment is 13% of our total revenue the viral or debt infrastructure will be sector inside of that which tends to take a lot of the calls it's more than half of that end market owned by itself so pricing more in the mid-single digits as a percentage of our revenue. And you know there I think when we look at incremental dollars of where we are investing. And if I refer you back to our capital management call that we get stay back in February, we talked about the fact that we wanted to increase incrementally dollars in both the industrial and automotive market because that\u2019s where we believe the growth will be. With communications equipment, I would say that we got some caveats depending on which business we are looking at. In Embedded, I would say that those investments are down versus where say where maybe five years ago. But on the same view inside of Analog, they're actually up because the some of the complexity that, that\u2019s being developed inside of the radio. So, we do believe that that market will continue to provide great opportunities for us for a very long period of time. But we just don\u2019t believe that there is going to be significant growth, we don\u2019t know if any carriers that want to take up the CapEx over the next 5 and 10 years, over a long period of time. So, thank you for that question, Greg and thank you all for joining us tonight. A replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Analysts : Adam Gonzalez - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet Operator : Good day everyone, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 12% from a year ago. Demand for our products continued to be strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 16% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 17% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share was $1.26. With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, and free cash flow margin was 29.0% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and also increased our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion, which together reflect our commitment to return all of free cash flow to our owners. I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 16% due to growth in power and signal chain. High volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 17% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined $70 million from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E, which began in the first quarter of 2017. Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Industrial demand remains strong, with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digits. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digits. Personal electronics was about even, with results varying by customer. Communications equipment grew while results varied by customer. And finally, enterprise systems grew, primarily due to servers. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide diversity and longevity of products, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. Raphael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.66 billion or 64.5% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 240 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $787 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, were 22% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.79 billion, or 43.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47%, up from 41.2% a year-ago, and for Embedded Processing was 34.9%, up from 28.2% a year ago. Our focused investment on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the third quarter was $1.29 billion or $1.26 per share. This included a $38 million discrete tax benefit that was $18 million higher than our original guidance for the quarter, adding about $0.02 to earnings per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.72 billion in the quarter, up 18% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $186 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.82 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $574 million or about 4% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectation. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.25 billion or 29% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term, and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. As Dave mentioned already, in September we announced we will increase our dividend by 24% and also increase our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.50 per share to $0.62 per share, or $2.48 annualized. This is our 14th consecutive year of dividend increases. And over the past five years, we have increased the dividend by a compounded average rate of 24%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $10 billion at the end of third quarter. For the third quarter, we paid $495 million in dividend and repurchased $650 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.15 billion in the third quarter. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.99 billion in dividends, or about 47% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.32 billion. These combined returns of dividends and repurchases and our recent announcement to increase the dividend and share repurchase authorizations demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $3.44 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter, 76% of which was owned by the company's U.S. entities. This is consistent with our long-term objective to have onshore cash readily available for multiple uses. Inventory days were 119, up 1 day from a year ago and within our expected range. Our total debt is unchanged at $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.87 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.01 to $1.15, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. Our expected annual operating tax rate for 2017 continues to be about 31%. For fourth quarter 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 29%, which includes about $20 million of discrete tax items, up from our previous guidance of $10 million. This is the rate you should use for your model for fourth quarter. For 2018, we're providing you with our quarterly tax rate expectations for both the operating and effective tax rates. You can find this detail on our Investor Relations website under the Financial Summary Data section. Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for additional follow up. Rebecca? Operator : Thank you. And first we'll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Adam Gonzalez - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks. This is Adam Gonzalez on for Vivek. So my first question is, last year you guided Q4 pretty conservatively and ended up reporting growth that was about twice as fast. How would you contrast the demand environment this year versus last year? And the reason why I bring this up is because your Q4 outlook of down 10% seems to be below seasonal. And I'm wondering, if that outlook really holds true, what are the areas of weakness that you're seeing that's driving this? Thanks. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes. So I think that if you look at our guidance, I'd say that we're not indicating that anything is atypical that's occurring. And I'd just remind you that whenever we've had something that's been unusual, whether that's been by market or by sector or sometimes even by customer, we've been pretty clear on that and would share it, and we've got nothing to share. So I'd just point out that if you look at the range of our guidance, that's going to vary and can comprehend several different scenarios. And at the midpoint, on a year on year basis, we'll grow about 9%, which we consider to be pretty robust. So, do you have a follow-on? Adam Gonzalez - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. I guess looking at your free cash flow per share growth, the last couple of quarters, it's kind of trended below the longer-term 8% to 10% that you traditionally see. I'm wondering why that is and what are the catalysts to get that back up to where it has been. Thanks. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, Adam, thanks for giving me opportunity to talk about that. On free cash flow, it grew 4% on a trailing 12-month basis, and that is compared to a higher number for revenue on the same basis. And the difference is higher working capital, particularly accounts receivables and tax payments. If you look at the accounts receivable from 3Q 2015 to 3Q 2016, that actually drained whereas from 3Q 2016 to 3Q 2017, it built. So that is a source of cash in one case and a use of cash in another case. But, and in the case of the tax payments, we had a higher, disproportionately higher tax payment in the most recent comparison versus the previous trailing 12-month comparison. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Great. Thank you, Adam. Tell Vivek we said hello, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next we'll hear from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hello. Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution, the free cash flow generation and the capital return. Clearly the demand trends are pretty strong in the markets that you serve. Maybe you could just talk about the demand trends from a geographical perspective. I think last quarter you saw year over year growth in most geographies. I'm just wondering if the strength continues to be broad based. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, Harlan, I would say that certainly the demand was broad based. If you look across our product lines, we've got 65 to 70 different product lines, and the demand was very strong across those as well as strong across the region. So we had revenue up in three of the four regions year on year in Europe, Asia and the U.S., and it was about even in Japan. And again, I just always remind that when we give regional color, that's where we ship the product. That's what we can measure. Where that product actually ends up from a regional standpoint, we really don't have visibility into. Do you have a follow-on? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks for the color there. On the OpEx front, great operating leverage. You drove 12% sequential growth in sales, but your OpEx declined by 3%. So you guys are driving some serious leverage here. The OpEx as a percent of sales is actually just below your target range, and so I guess the question is, what drove the sequential decline in the OpEx. And how should we think about the OpEx profile just over the next few quarters? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, I'll take that. For OpEx, we think of that in terms of, from a model standpoint, we think of it as a percent of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, and for the last couple years, we've actually been running at about 23%. And in the current trailing 12-months, we're about 22% of revenue. So we have said that in a stable environment, which we are, we can run in the bottom half of our expectations of 20% to 25%. So we've been running at about 22%, so that's well within that. Of course to us, OpEx are investments, and obviously that goes for R&D, but even inside of G&A we think of a large portion there as investment. So in R&D of course we're focusing on industrial and automotive, because those are the best markets. where semiconductor growth is happening. But in the G&A front, we have many investments there on ti.com and demand creation just to continue building on our reach of channels, reach of markets, competitive advantage that we have talked about. Before we go to the next caller, I'd like to just make a comment on the previous question on working capital. I want to stress that while our accounts receivables increased in that last comparison, the delta days sales outstanding actually decreased by 1 day. So it's at 34. So that just goes to show you how healthy the account receivable balance is. I wanted just to clarify that. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Okay, great. Thank you, Harlan, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : From Deutsche Bank, Ross Seymore. Unknown Speaker : Hey. This is Jerrell (17:41) on behalf of Ross. Thanks for letting us ask a question. Just asking about the general end markets here, could you provide some end market detail in terms of how they trended quarter on quarter in addition to year on year? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Sure, Jerrell (17:54). If you look at industrial, it increased with most sectors growing. And again, we've got 14 sectors there, so fairly broad based. Automotive increased with most sectors growing. Personal electronics increased, as one would expect, as you move into the holiday builds with most sectors growing there. Comms equipment was even, and enterprise systems grew due to both servers and projectors. Do you have a follow-on? Unknown Speaker : Yes. Just a question on the report here. So your September quarter revenues exceeded the high end of your prior guidance, and it's the first time in about a year that happened. However, gross margins expanded just 20 basis points. I think we were expecting more. So given the magnitude of the revenue beat, why didn't higher revenues result in more than 20 basis points of gross margin fall through? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes. What I would tell you is that generally what we suggest and what we recommend to analysts and investors to think about our fall through \u2013 in the 70% to 75% range. But that is over the long haul, over a relatively long amount of time. In any one quarter, that fall through can be a little different. Now for example, in the comparison versus a year ago, which arguably, I would argue is more relevant as it has more time obviously in between, that was close to an 85% fall through, right. The increase in gross margin was 240 basis points, just as an example of a comparison to the sequential basis. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Okay. Thank you, Jerrell (19:38). And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the strong results. I guess my first question, I'm just kind of curious. When you look at year over year growth now for the core business, Analog and Embedded, you've had very healthy sort of double digit year over year growth. I'm wondering if you could kind of comment to what extent you think that's share gains, to what extent you think that is just easy compares, to what extent you think that might be a little bit of overheating relative to customer order activity. And you did a fantastic job on your own balance sheet, kind of managing inventories. I'm wondering if you could give us some color around customer inventory levels. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes. So, John, I think that if you look at general market conditions, they're similar to 90 days ago and certainly continue to remain strong. However, I think it's still yet to be seen how long that will extend over how long of a period of time. So we've got no indications of inventories growing or double ordering. And like I pointed out last quarter, history suggests we never really see that, those types of things ahead of time. But I think again, it's important to qualify what we can see. So we've got really good visibility into our distributors' inventory, and that remains at about four weeks. It's even both sequentially and year on year. Our visibility in customer inventories will vary depending if we're on consignment or not. So for our consignment OEMs, we hold that inventory on our balance sheet, and we don't see any unusual signals or other things like expedites that would suggest that there's issues inside of that. And our visibility of course into inventory beyond that and down our customers' channels, we just can't see that of course. So we just remain focused, as we have for a long time, focusing on both our internal manufacturing and internal inventory strategies. And we're focused on trying to keep lead time steady, which they have. Delivery metrics really high because that's what gives customers confidence that they can get the product when they need it. So you have a follow-on, John? John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes. I do for Rafael. As I think Harlan mentioned, you guys did a fantastic job on operating leverage in the quarter. When you look at absolute operating profits though, there's still a pretty meaningful gap between the Embedded business and the Analog business. And I think you've commented in the past that, theoretically, there's no reason why that gap can't close over time. I'm kind of curious. When I look sequentially, the operating leverage in the Embedded business was particularly high. I think the fall through was almost 86% Q on Q. I'm just kind of curious. Have we reached a scale point in that business where we would expect fall through to be higher from here on out and that gap to close more quickly? Any comments around that would be helpful. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Sure. Well, to your point, the profitability of that business has in fact improved significantly. On a year on year basis, profit from operation is up 673 basis points. But at the end of the day, the main objective here is to grow free cash flow. We think that is \u2013 we believe that is what really drives value for the owners of the company, so and then return all that free cash flow to the owners. So we're not particularly focused on any one of those percentages because there are many ways to drive that free cash flow and one of them is expanding the margins. But then the other one is just growing the top line at the same margin, right. So that's the key message that the core objective that we're trying to achieve. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Okay. Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And that'll come from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Unknown Speaker : Hi, there. This is James Limz (23:52) and Shirley Hu on for Stacy. Sorry if we missed it, but we were just wondering what book-to-bill was for the quarter. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Book-to-bill was, it was 1.0. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : 1.0. Yes. Unknown Speaker : 1.0. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : So. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : And again, we always, we give that number. I would say that always be cautious with it because we've got 60% of our revenue that's on consignment that we don't carry any backlog or don't get any orders in advance. So that's part of the reason why we don't focus on it. Do you have a follow-on? Unknown Speaker : Yes. I guess so. We were just hoping for some more color on the OpEx and why it was a bit light and just how you see that trajectory going forward. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Well, it came in about as expected. So I wouldn't characterize it as a bit light. And as I mentioned earlier on an earlier question, on a trailing 12-month basis, which is how we think is appropriate to look at, is, came in at 22%. I think in the last couple years it's been at 23%. So it's trended a little down over the last few years, but it is well within the bottom half of our expectations of 20% to 25%, which is our expectations when things are stable, which they are now. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Okay. Thank you. We'll go to our next caller, please. Operator : C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, forward look outlook on gross margins. Can you talk about what you're expecting mix wise and whether that fits in with an incremental gross margin around 70%? Or are there kind of puts and takes around that? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated : On gross margins, what we have said before, and we'll continue to say, really hasn't changed our guidance on that is that our general expectation is revenue to pull through at about 70% to 75%. And that's over the long haul, right, not in any one quarter. So you should think about it that way. And as we continue to grow the top line, driven by our investments in analog and embedded from a product standpoint, and industrial, automotive from an end market standpoint, we expect to continue gaining share and that additional revenue to fall through at about those rates. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Do you have a follow on, C.J.? C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Yes, please. Could you provide an update on where you are on the 300-millimeter? Interested in terms of utilization rates as well as some of the work you're doing on the back end and other fronts to drive even higher incremental margins. Thanks. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes, you bet. I think, as C.J. asked that question, there are probably callers on the line and listening that aren't familiar. But we've got four competitive advantages, the first of which is our manufacturing and technology. And I think the 300-millimeter is a good example of that strength. The other three, just quickly, are the breadth of the product portfolio; our channel advantages, which includes the size of our sales force and ti.com; and then just the diversity and longevity across markets and sectors and customers and products, which I think leads for investors a high confidence and a high terminal value of that product portfolio. But why 300-millimeter matters is that we've got a structural cost advantage. So with that larger wafer size, we get 40% lower cost on the chip when we manufacture that. And most chips in the industry are built on 200-millimeter. So we started this year, we've had about 25% of our 300-millimeter capacity footprint utilized. Essentially most of the analog growth this year, and as we have seen for several years, is supported by 300-millimeter. We'll actually give an update to that in our February capital management call on what the precise numbers are, but that revenue continues to grow on 300-millimeter, and we continue to see the benefit. So thank you for that question, C.J., and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. You've had for several quarters strength in automotive and industrial, and that continued in the quarter you just reported. In the outlook, I'm wondering if there's any change in terms of the relative strengths of your expected results by end market? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes \u2013 well as you know, we don't provide color below the top line, but certainly if there was anything significant there, we'd call out. And I can tell you there isn't anything significant. And I think if you look at that strength inside of industrial and automotive, I think as we look at third quarter, as it has for some time, that strength has been very broad based. So, we've got 14 sectors inside of industrial. Most of those have been growing double digits for some time. We continue to direct our investments across those 14, so it's a very intentional investment and return. Same thing in automotive. So we've got diversity across five different sectors. All five of those are contributing to growth. And that diversity is across the product lines, it's across geographies. So we feel really good about that strength. Do you have a follow-on? William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. I do. One more. We're aware that there's been a change in compensation to distributors. It's been pretty well publicized, I think, relative to paying them for demand \u2013 so-called demand creation. I'm wondering if there are still benefits to be made by TI, if there was anything squeezed out in the quarter just reported or anything that's still on the come, either in December or beyond from that change in sort of how you work with distribution. Thank you. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yes. So again, we don't \u2013 we no longer do pay for demand creation. As you indicated, distributors of course will continue to play a role in order fulfillment for our customers. So those relationships have been evolving, especially as the reach of our channel advantages continues to strengthen. So as I mentioned earlier, even in this call, that is a unique advantage and includes both ti.com and the size and skill of our sales and apps team. So those changes began implementation three years ago, for any accounts where we had direct TI resources. That represented about 80% of the TAM. And then later last year, we implemented changes with the remaining 20%. So I'd say a good portion of that is worked through, and it's not significant enough that it's going to make any of these earnings conference calls. So we just continue to invest in our demand creation activities, and we feel really good about the results that that is producing. So with that, I think we've got time for one more call. Operator? Operator : And that'll come from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet : Great. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Hi, Romit. Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet : Hey, Dave. How are you? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Great. Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet : I just wanted to ask about the revenue growth, if you look at sort of growth over the last 12 months. I mean semiconductor demand, it just seems like there's a resurgence here. We certainly see that looking at the performance of your Analog and Embedded businesses. And that it's more than just \u2013 it's coming from more than just consumer confidence and how they're managing inventories. And I'm just curious, if you look at the performance of Analog and Embedded over the last 12 months, has it changed your outlook for the long-term growth of the company? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yeah, I don't think so, Romit. I think that we're fortunate that we've got investments in capacity and we've got a product portfolio that is very, very diverse. It's rich in automotive and industrial, which are the best growing parts of the market. And I don't think that that changes our outlook over the long term. And the best signal that we get from customers are orders, so we're able to respond to those if things continue to strengthen and strengthen from here. And if they go the other way, we've got a playbook ready to go if that were to happen. So do you have a follow-on? Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet : Yeah. I mean you talked about automotive, and one of the things that we see is that this shift to electric vehicles has a lot of momentum and that with electric powertrains, we could see demand for power semiconductors accelerate. And I was just curious how you guys think about the opportunity in electric vehicles. Is that a sub-segment that TI is uniquely positioned for? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : Yeah. I think that our investments in automotive are really directed across five different sectors. So powertrain is one of them, which is primarily EV. So, but if you look at the other spaces like infotainment cluster, passive safety, ADAS or advanced driver assist systems, and body electronics and lighting, we're very intentionally directing our investments across those areas. So certainly as EVs become a higher mix of units that are sold on an annual basis, we'll benefit from that, but we're not dependent on it. And I think if I bring you back to our four competitive advantages, just that diversity and longevity. We'll benefit from ADAS systems being deployed and as the industry marches forward to autonomous driving or the mix of EVs. Those are things we'll benefit from, but our business model isn't dependent on them. So we're real excited with the diversity of design wins that we have there, and we think we've got a lot of runway there as well as inside of industrial. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated : So with that, we'll wrap up tonight's call, and thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation. And we do thank everyone for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

Bernstein David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Fourth Quarter 2017 and 2017 Yearend Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold an update to our capital management strategy on February 06 at 10 :00 AM Central Time. Similar to what we have done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy. You also likely saw that last week we announced that Brian Crutcher will become President and CEO on June 01 and that Rich Templeton will continue as our Chairman. I'm sure you'll join me in congratulating them both. Before I give you an overview of the fourth quarter results, I want to summarize the impact that December 2017 Tax Reform Act had. We applaud the reform to U.S. corporate law because it enables U.S. headquartered companies like TI to compete more effectively on a global basis. The new law recognizes and rewards companies for exporting and having manufacturing, R&D and intellectual property in the United States. Regarding the financial implications, there's three important points I'd like to point out. First, investors should assume an ongoing 18% annual operating tax rate starting in 2019. This rate comprehends the 21% statutory corporate rate and the benefit of exports and having manufacturing R&D and intellectual property in the U.S. This rate does not include an estimate for stock-based compensation impact, which we provide at the start of each year. Second, for 2018 investors should assume a 23% annual operating tax rate before stock-based compensation. This 23% rate comprehends the long-term rate of 18% that I just described plus five percentage points of transitional tax effect that must be expensed in 2018. These transitional tax effects are mostly non-cash. To get you to an effective rate by quarter, we're assuming about $55 million of stock-based compensation benefit for 2018 split quarterly with $30 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters and $5 million in the fourth. Therefore, the effective tax rate should be about 21% in the first quarter, 22% in the second and third and 23% in the fourth quarter of 2018. You'll find this information summarized on our IR website under Financial Summary Data as we've done in the past. Lastly, in the fourth quarter of 2017, our tax expense included approximately $800 million of expense that was primarily related to the recently passed Tax Reform Act. This included about $700 million for the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings as well as about $60 million for a reduction in deferred tax assets. The charge on deferred tax asset is non-cash. The charge associated indefinitely reinvested earnings will impact cash flow and will be paid over eight years. We'll pay about $60 million in the first five years, $100 million in the sixth, $140 million in the seventh, $160 million in the eight year. This will have impact -- there is no impact to cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2017 because of these tax changes. Of course, our initial estimates of the financial impact on the Tax Reform Act could change as we refine our analysis and if any additional guidance on this new law becomes available. Our long-term investment strategy remains unchanged by tax reform. With more cash available on an ongoing basis, we'll continue to invest to grow our business, to strengthen our competitive advantages and return all free cash flow to our owners. Again, we believe the reform to U.S. corporate tax will enable U.S. headquartered companies like TI to compete more effectively on a global basis. Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 10% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive and industrial markets. Communications equipment declined, while personal electronics grew mid-single digits, but results varied by customer. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 11% and embedded processing grew 20% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.34 including $0.75 of tax-related expenses not in our original guidance, primarily due to the recently passed Tax Reform Act that I just discussed. With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of our ongoing strength of our business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.7 billion up 14% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 31.2% of revenue, up from 30.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In 2017, we returned $4.7 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago quarter, Analog grew 11% due to power and signal chain. High volume declined. Embedded processing revenue grew 20% from a year ago quarter due to growth in both product lines, which are processors and connected microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 16% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties which began in the first quarter of 2017. For the year in total, Analog and Embedded, each grew about 16% on broad-based growth and combined are now 90% of TI's revenue. Let me describe our -- next our revenue by end market in 2017. Just as a reminder, we provide an estimate of TI's revenue by end market on an annual basis. We break this into six categories; industrial, automotive, personal electronics and that'll include things like mobile phones, PC, tablets and TVs, comps equipment, enterprise systems and everything else which is primarily calculators. Notably, every market contributed to growth in 2017. Specifically, industrial comprised 35% of our revenue, up two percentage points from 2016. Automotive was 19% up one point. Personal electronics was 25%, down one point. Comps equipment and other were 12% and 3% respectively, down a percentage point, while enterprise systems was about 6% in both years. Also, we did not have a customer who was more than 10% of our revenue in 2017. We continue to focus on our strategy on industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and longevity. Taken together, this all translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. In 2017, industrial and automotive combined made up 54% of TI's revenue up from 42% just four years ago. We've established momentum in these markets and we are far from satisfied and continue to make improvements. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.44 billion or 65.1% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing cost. Gross profit margin increased by 250 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $795 million. Operating expenses on a trailing 12-month basis were up 3% and were 21.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. For the year, we have invested $1.51 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 due to amortization of intangible. It will decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Operating profit was $1.56 million or 41.7% of revenue. Operating profit was up 17% from a year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 46.9% up from 43.2% a year ago and for a better processing, it was 34.3% up from 28.8% a year ago. Our focus investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Other income and expense declined $176 million as we signed several intellectual property agreements in the year ago quarter that will not repeat or that did not repeat. Net income in the fourth quarter was $344 million or $0.34 per share, which included $0.75 in tax-related expenses not in a prior outlook as we have discussed. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.93 billion in the quarter, up 39% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $231 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $706 million of our stock for a total return of $1.32 billion in the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.47 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We issued $500 million of debt in 10-year notes during the quarter. This leaves total debt of $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 134 up eight days from a year ago and within our expected range. Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2017, cash flow from operations was $5.36 billion up 16% from the previous year. Capital expenditures were $695 million or 4.6% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectations. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.67 billion or 31.2% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. Total cash returned to owners in 2017 was $4.66 billion. This combined returns of dividends and share repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $2.10 billion in dividends or about 45% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.3% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.49 billion to $3.79 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.01 to $1.17, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit. In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance, from topline growth and margin expansion to free cash generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages to the disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products; analog and embedded processing and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lineup for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for a follow-up. Renee? Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on what you're seeing in different end markets at the start of the year? When I look at your Q1 sales outlook, it's in line with consensus; seasonally somewhat conservative after seasonally or below seasonal quarter you had in Q4? And Dave, it seems to be in somewhat contrast to the very strong micro environment. So, is there something that you're seeing that is keeping you more conservative than usual? Dave Pahl : Yeah Vivek, first just take a look at the results in total. If you look at the quarter, fourth quarter came in with 10% year-over-year growth. We just took for the year, the company came in at 12% year-over-year growth. And if you look at the outlook, at the midpoint, we would be at mid-upper or I'd say upper single-digit growth overall. So, I think if you look inside of that, we've continued to see strength in automotive and industrial. The exciting thing about that of course is that both of those markets we think will drive our revenue for quite some time. I think inside of the fourth quarter as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we did see weakness in comps equipment. That's a market that traditionally is choppy and then in PE it's really more of a mixed bag there and more dependent or varied by customer overall, but again with double-digit growth in the quarter and 12% growth for the year, I'd consider that as still strong performance. Do you have a follow-on? Vivek Arya : Yeah. Thank you, Dave. So maybe let me ask that same question in a different way. So, you grew 10% in Q4, when I look at Q1, it's pointing to a somewhat deceleration to 7%, which is still impressive but a deceleration regardless. So are you seeing anything in the environment that is making you conservative and for a follow-on from that is do you think this is a sustainable growth rate right. I know you don't give out full year guidance, but do you see the trend sustainable for the rest of the year, thank you? Dave Pahl : Yeah, so let me now try to forecast the year. I think as you said, upper single-digits is still strong growth. I think when we look at the macro environment, it overall seems constructive, continues to seem constructive for us. We did see changes in comps equipment. I wouldn't describe that as something that's necessarily a macro effect. It is just what it is that continues to be a choppy market for us, but a good market. It's a market that we continue to invest in and make money there for some time. So overall, I think we're positioned well and again I think that the overall environment in constructive. Rafael Lizardi : Let me just add to that view, take a step back and think about on the sustainability question, the way we think about our markets, it starts with a global GDP growth, 3% to 4% or so and then semiconductors should grow on top of that 1% or 2%. Particularly, the markets that we focus, which are industrial automotive and that's because, that's where the semiconductor companies have been. And then on top of that, we've been gaining share in Analog and Embedded on a pretty consistent basis. So, you can think of another point or two on top of that for our long-term sustainable growth. Of course, any one quarter, even any one year, that can vary, but over the long haul, this is a great market to be in particularly industrial automotive, which is where we're focusing our investments, our efforts because that's what the semiconductor content growth is happening. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go to our next caller please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Hey guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Did 21% roughly growth that you had in your industrial business, any color you can provide Dave on what's going on underneath the covers there? That's a very, very impressive number and kind of getting at the same sustainability question, any color that you could give looking backward might be helpful? Dave Pahl : Yeah you bet Ross and I think if you, the numbers that we provide you are a rounded percentages, so I would describe industrial growth overall in the upper teens when you look year-over-year and that growth is based on almost all sectors growing. So very, very diverse. That's one of the things that we -- that we like about it and for those that listen to us regularly, you've heard me talk about the 14 different sectors that we have that make up the industrial segment now include things like factory automation and control, industrial transport and things that you would expect, but it also includes things like medical and healthcare, avionics appliances and those types of things that perhaps the financial community wouldn't put inside of industrial, but behaves much in the same way. So that's why they're in there. So, we're really pleased with that growth. What's encouraging about it again is it's coming from very diverse sources and it's really about content gains inside of that market. Do you have a follow-on Ross? Ross Seymore : Yeah, I do. Switching over to the OpEx side for you either you or Rafael, in 2017 there was a big delta between what R&D did versus SG&A and then now also that you have some better profitability with the tax rate being lower, really just wanted to see what your views are on the OpEx side of the equation overall? Will you spend more now that you have more cash and how will it be split if any differences between those two buckets? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah Ross, what I would tell you is that first at a high level, OpEx to us is an investment, whether it's R&D or SG&A. In the case of R&D, obviously we're putting out more differentiated products, focused on industrial and automotive to strengthen our competitive advantages, in this case, the breadth of portfolio for us. In the case of SG&A, there are a lot of things there, but one thing that we've been focusing on is the migration and that strengthens another competitive advantage which is a channel advantage. So, we did that in 2017. Our OpEx was up about 3% and we're going to continue focusing our investments on that. On the second part of your question on tax reform, and by the way on that, let me step back for a second. As Dave said during the call, that is a great thing. We're very happy with tax reform. It's going to enable companies like TI, U.S.-based companies to compete more effective on a global basis. Now we are on an even playing field versus companies outside the United States. So that is great, but our long-term investment strategy remains unchanged. We're going to continue investing to strengthen our competitive advantages as we have talked about before and now with more cash, we're going to do that and then we're going to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company, which is our commitment as part of our capital management strategy and we have been talking about for a number of years. Dave Pahl : Right. Thank you, Ross and I will go to our next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We move next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Dave, you talked a little bit about the communications equipment market and the weakness there. Was that focused on around a single region or a couple of customers or was it broad-based and when would you expect that part of the market to inflict to the upside? Dave Pahl : Yeah. Well first I'd say that it was different by customer and it impacted our segments differently because of that exposure and it's really hard to predict what direction that market will take over the long term. The good news is that our position even there is very broad-based. So, we will be reflective of the overall market. People will continue to buy communications equipment based stations and things for some time to come. We continue to invest and position ourselves well for newer technologies as they come out. So that includes trends like carrier aggregation or massive multiple antennas that we'll see in later 4G as well as 5G standard. So very confident about those positions and in the short-term the market will be what the market will be. Do you have a follow-on? Toshiya Hari : Yes. Thank you. I had a question on inventory at TI what you see in the distribution channel also your end customers, specifically on your own inventory, I was a little bit surprised to see inventory tick up on a sequential basis. I think historically Q4 would be flat to down if I'm not mistaken. So, if you can comment on how you would describe inventory that would be great, thank you? Dave Pahl : Yeah Toshiya, let me start and then I'll hand it over to Rafael and I think when you look at inventory and I'll start with inventory, the channel it remains steady at about four weeks. I'll point out to those that aren't as familiar with us, that's structurally lower than many of our peers will run because of consignment program. So, you'll see that as a half to about a third as what many of our peers will run and we feel very comfortable at those types of levels. What we see down channel from customers is we'll depend on what type of arrangements we've got. If we've got a consignment program with them, we can see very into their manufacturing plans and their build plans because we own that material until they pull it, but really our visibility ends there meaning that when they -- if they're building inventory of if they're putting inventory down channel, we can't see that. But we see no indications of inventory that's building there overall. So, let me turn it over to Rafael about our inventory. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, so let me step back and tell you how we think about our inventory overall. We want to maintain high levels of customer service; one, to minimize obsolescence, optimize manufacturing utilization and all these things vary depending on multiple factors. For example, consignment, we have many consignment engagements and in fact we want to continue increasing consignment engagement because we get -- we tend to get a better signal to consignment engagement. So, all that is good stuff. Also step back and think about our strategy focusing on diverse customers, focusing on diverse positions on industrial automotive where we design a part in industrial and that part may sell for 10, 20 even 30 years. So, the inventory is good for a long, long time. So, we don't have to worry about this obsolescence risk that maybe in the past we have the other types of focus that we had. So, in this particular case, in the fourth quarter inventory days ended up at 134, that's within our range and we had a chance to replenish some of our low-volume high mix stuff. So, we're going to -- we did some of that. In fact, we're going to continue doing that because over the long haul, as we would replenish that, we have inventory available to sell to those industrial and automotive customers and be able to keep those high level for customer service. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Toshiya. We'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave or Rafael, maybe just to follow up on the inventory question, I guess maybe asked a different way, were you planning to grow inventory sequentially in the calendar fourth quarter or did it end up growing because some revenue upside did not materialize in the quarter? And I guess importantly as you look out to calendar first quarter, how do you expect to management inventories for the calendar first quarter? Will it come down from here? Are you taking any unusual utilization action around inventory to bring it down? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, what I would tell is inventory came in about as expected. And on the second part of your question, of course we don't get into that level of detail, but I would tell you that as I mentioned to the earlier caller, we want to have buffers of inventory, particularly when addressing the industrial market, but also the automotive market. It's a good thing to have to these buffers and we have many, many of our products are low-volume high mix and by the way those are products that last for -- we can keep them for 10 years in our shelves and then we sell them to our customers for 20 or 30 years. So, from a manufacturing standpoint, it makes sense to build them and keep them in storage and building them in batches and it's just a lot more efficient that way. So, we did that in fourth quarter and if depending on the market, we can now build some more in the first, second and third, we'll do that again. Dave Pahl : Yeah and I'll just add kind of the corollary to the point that Rafael made. We do look at risk of obsolescence. So, if we have a part that's a custom or primarily used by one or two customers, we'll tend to keep very low inventory on those parts. So, managing that inventory stack to risk of obsolescence is something that we aggressively do. Do you have a follow-on John? John Pitzer : Just to be clear, is this a change in sort of your long-term inventory targets or are we just kind of still within those targets, just perhaps maybe migrating to the higher ends? Rafael Lizardi : The objective is the same. As far as the target, as we do every year, we look at our metrics for the capital management strategy and as you know, we have 10 or 12 metrics. So, we look at those and if we need to do tweak them, we tweak them. So, if February sticks with our call and we'll go to there and if we need to tweak some of those metrics including inventory, we will do that at that point. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, John. We'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Hey. Good afternoon, guys and solid job on the quarterly execution. Can you just give us an idea of the breadth of the demand trends on a year-over-year basis by geography? I think last quarter you guys saw year-over-year growth in most geographies except for Japan which was flat. Just wondering if the strength continues to be broad-based here? Dave Pahl : Yeah Harlan, it was broad-based. We saw revenue growth in Europe, in Asia as well as the U.S., but again this year, Japan was down. It's almost very similar, but I would describe that the growth is being very broad-based. Do you have a follow-on? Harlan Sur : Yes, I do. Thanks for that. Your analog revenues grew by about $1.4 billion in 2017 and if my memory serves me correctly, you guys exited 2016 with your 300-millimeter fabs diving about $2.5 billion in revenues on an annualized basis. Is it therefore fair to assume that you're driving now close to about $4 billion in revenues through your 300-millimeter analog fab? So, utilization roughly about 48%. Dave Pahl : Yeah that's -- you're right in zip code Harlan and so we ran about 50% of that capacity in our 300-millimeter fabs which includes the Richardson fab and also DMOS6, so somewhere in the ZIP Code of about $4 billion of revenue and I think as we look at that and just to take a step back, manufacturing and technology is one of our four competitive advantages. 300 millimeter is probably one of the best examples that we can point to inside of that. And we have because of 300 millimeter, when you look at the number of dies, we produce on that versus 200 millimeter, we just have a structural cost advantage on every wafer that we build and every dollar of revenue we put through there. So that's the benefit that has -- we've accrued over the years and have increased that. But the great news is we continue to have a lot of -- a lot of headway, a lot of runway ahead of us. So\u2026 Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, just to build on that, that is part of what's supporting the free cash flow grow that we're seeing. This year free cash flow growth was 14% on a per-share basis with 16%. Just to illustrate the strength of the business model with the competitive advantages, our focus on auto and industrial and analog and embedded. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Harlan. We'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely : Thanks guys. I guess first question for Rafael, if you look at your cash flow deployment over the last few years, it will take out I think around $500 million in debt and then the rest of it goes to kind of one third buyback, two thirds dividend with the extra cash. Can we assume those same ratios or would you look to take out a little more debt or keep the kind of the same? Rafael Lizardi : So, Chris you have a few things there. Let me may be take one at a time. First with the debt, the way we think about that is we take on debt when economics make sense and right now the economics make sense. We have $4.1 billion of debt and is at a 2.05% weighted average coupon rate. And the one we took out recently was 10-year debt at 2.9%. Of course, that's pretax. So, the economics make sense and of course we do it in a very judicious way. We have -- we don't have concentrated maturities and we maintain a strategic flexibility. On the first part of your question, our commitment is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. You know us for a long time and you know that we've been doing that. This year for example, we generated $4.7 billion free cash flow and we returned guess what $4.7 billion. So, we're committed to doing that and we do it through both dividends and buyback. This year dividends were $2.1 billion, buybacks $2.6 billion. We have a robust and flexible model to do that. It doesn't have to be necessarily any particular split. Dividends would like to be between 40% and 60% of free cash flow of the current year and essentially repurchases is everything else. Do you have a follow-up on that? Chris Danely : Yeah thanks. Another I guess historical/longer-term question. So Q4, you guys are roughly on a sequential basis seasonal and if you look at I think the six quarters before that, every quarter was probably 1% to 3% about seasonal. So, are you seeing things I guess stabilizing or are cooling-off or any signs of that in the industry or am I just looking at the numbers too much and doing a little paralysis by analysis? Dave Pahl : Maybe more of the latter. I'd just say, when you look at the numbers Chris, really from the topline growth down to free cash flow generation, you just see the strength in the business model right. We've got -- we've been investing in analog and embedded. They represent 90% of our revenue. They go through 16% year-on-year. Industrial and automotive make up 54% of that. So, we won't control the short-term demand. It is what it is, but when you look at those numbers overall, I think at least when we look at it, we think -- we think they look pretty solid. So, thank you and we'll go to our next caller please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford C. Bernstein. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding the near-term OpEx trends, last few quarters OpEx come in light at least verses street expectations. I know you guys don't guide short-term OpEx, but I'd say this time it came a little higher than at least what we had expected. How did OpEx come in versus your own expectations in the quarter and how should we be thinking about as we go into Q1? Are there any I guess changes or differences versus what might ordinarily see in a typical Q1 in terms of your plans? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah Stacy, first OpEx came in about as expected. That's a short answer to the first question. Then before I go to the second question, let me take a step back. I think I alluded to this earlier, but just to mention and again we see OpEx as investments right. Whether it's R&D or SG&N and those were up 3% for the year. So very reasonable given the growth that we're turning our key markets in analogue and embedded and industrial and automotive. So, we're getting the results that we want from those investments. And those investments go to strengthen our competitive advantages and in the case of R&D maybe the easiest thing to point out is the broad portfolio that continues to grow and strengthen. And in the case of SG&A the easiest one to point to is demand creation and everything that we're doing there. Going to the second part of your question on the first quarter, as you know we don't get into specific detail there. What I'll tell you that it's normal. People are still going to take less vacation in the first quarter than they do in fourth because of Christmas and Thanksgiving and other things and we still have pay and benefit increases in February. So, we expect about the same as we usually expect in that transition. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-up Stacey? Stacy Rasgon : I do. Thank you. Around the inventory buffers that you were talking about putting in place, are you actually seeing shortages or lead times for those specific products actually just beginning to extend to drive that buffer addition or are you just being sort of proactive about getting in place now? And how much of the I guess inventory you guys -- total inventory as it stands today out of the $1.96 billion would correspond to some of these buffer areas? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, let me start and then Dave will chime in on the rest of your question, but the buffer, this is nothing new. We've had about four, five, six years or so obviously depending on demand, strength of demand, it fluctuates. We were able to build or it would drain in the buffers. So that's what they are there for. At times, we drain them. And frankly off the top of my head, I couldn't tell you how much of the $1.9 billion and change is for the buffers, but the bigger point is why we have the buffers? We're focusing end markets but industrial is the best example. We have a lot of small customers across the world, in the middle of the U.S., in Shenzhen, in the middle of Germany. Small customers focused on 14 sectors, hundreds of end equipment. You couldn\u2019t possibly build to order that stuff right, because if any one customer may order a few thousand pieces, so what you do is you build in, in bigger batches you store it and then you sell over time. And because the parts and just in our inventory last 10 years, then it's very affordable. It makes a lot of sense to do that and we do that with very low levels of scrap in any one quarter or any one year. Dave Pahl : I'll just add, I think when you look we're doing that Stacey, so that our lead time is going to remain stable and then probably coupled with that is we focus on making sure that we've got very high customer service metrics. So, when we say, we were going to ship something that we actually ship it on that date to customers. And those two things combined are what gives customers confidence that they can get the products that they need from us. So, we spent a lot of time and that's maybe just a highlight that that's one of the initiatives that we've had at our company as we looked at having more analog, more embedded products, more industrial and automotive, we knew we needed to ensure that we put in place the capabilities to be able to service customers of any size and have those types of metrics. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah and just to add a little bit to that, back on the way we look at inventory, think about improving manufacturing asset utilization. If you can improve and run the factories not completely level because you can never do that exactly like that, but fairly level that. It goes to a long way to improving your manufacturing processes, your yields, your cycle times and that just translates into lower cost, which gets what translates into more free cash flow and that goes to the strength of our business model how we generate all that free cash flow that we have been growing consistently for what now 13-14 years. Dave Pahl : Great. Okay. Operator, I think we have time for one more caller please. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong : Thanks very much. So, a follow-on from Vivek's question earlier. So, you're seeing a slight deceleration in your overall blended growth, but in the December quarter you had really strong growth in analog and embedded. Would we expect in the March quarter sort of roughly equal deceleration in both analog and embedded or is it one more than the other? Dave Pahl : Yeah Dave, we provide guidance at the top level for revenue and we try not to get into the corners by markets or by products. So now if there is something unusual going on, either those by market or a specific customer or in one of those business units, we would call that out and there's nothing for us to highlight inside of there. Do you have a follow-on? David Wong : No. That's good. Thank you very much. Dave Pahl : Okay. With that, I'll turn it over to Rafael. Rafael Lizardi : Sure, let me just finish with a few comments on some key items that I want everybody to remember. First, the strength of our business model is demonstrated through our financial performance. We have strong growth in both analog and embedded, which are the best products and industrial automotive, which are the best markets. That's where the semiconductor content growth is happening and we're confident that's the way it will continue to happen for many, many years to come. Second, as I said before, we're very excited about tax reform. It's made TI just more competitive on a global scale, so we're excited about what we can do with that. And finally, we continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy. We remain committed to returning all free cash flow to the owners of the company. Dave? Dave Pahl : Thank you all for joining us. Again, please plan to join us for our Capital Management Call on February 6 at 10 :00 AM Central Time. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will also be available through the website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the first quarter increased 11% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 14% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.35, including $0.14 in tax-related benefits not in our original guidance. These were primarily due to the recent tax reform law. With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.9 billion, up 17% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 32.1% of revenue, up from 30.7% a year ago. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $5.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 14% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 15% from a year-ago quarter due to growth in both Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 13% from a year ago primarily due to Custom ASIC products. Now, I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand remained strong with broad-based growth. Automotive demand remained strong, with all sectors contributing to growth. Personal electronics grew, with increases across several sectors and customers. Communications equipment declined, but was about even compared with the fourth quarter. And lastly, enterprise systems grew. As we get more insight into and guidelines on the tax reform law, we have updated our tax estimates. First, we now expect a 16% ongoing annual operating tax rate starting in 2019, down from our prior expectation of 18%. Second, for 2018, investors should now assume a 20% annual operating tax rate, down from our prior expectation of 23%. The 2018 rate is higher than the 2019 rate due to a transitional non-cash expense in 2018. As a reminder, our operating tax rate does not include any discrete tax items. To get you to an effective tax rate by quarter, for the balance of the year, we continue to expect the benefit from stock-based compensation to be about $10 million in the second and third quarters, and about $5 million in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the effective tax rate will be about 20% in each of the remaining quarters of 2018. You will find this information summarized on our IR website under financial summary data as we have done in the past. And then lastly, in the first quarter of 2018, we had about $140 million of tax benefits that were not in our original guidance. These include $50 million due to stock-based compensation, $50 million due to the updated estimates related to the tax reform law, and $40 million primarily due to the previously described decrease in the tax rate for 2018. In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content. These markets also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.45 billion, or 64.6% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased 160 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $818 million, a 1% increase from a year ago and about as expected. R&D grew 4 % and SG&A was about even. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.9% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.52 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share. Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Operating profit was $1.55 billion, or 40.9% of revenue. Operating profit was up 24% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 45.4%, up from 41.4% a year ago, and for Embedded Processing was 35.4%, up from 29.9% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the first quarter was $1.37 billion, or $1.35 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $189 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $4.92 billion on a trailing 12 month basis, up 17% from a year ago. In the first quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $873 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.48 billion in the first quarter. We have returned $5.1 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 45% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt is also $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 136, up 4 days from a year ago and within our expected range. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.78 billion to $4.10 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.39, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years, from top-line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach, and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products Analog and Embedded Processing and the best markets industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks Rafael, operator, you can open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for additional follow-up. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and consistent execution. For my first question, since you guys have such a wide perspective on the global economy, I was wondering if you could give us a sense on what you are seeing versus for example what you might have thought at the start of the year. Are you noticing any areas of slow down or pause or anything because your Q1 results are very strong, Q2 is above consensus expectations perhaps sequentially it's not what it has been in the past. So just broadly what you're seeing in the economy versus what you thought three months ago? Rafael Lizardi : Let me -- I will start with that and then Dave, you want to chime in on that. But I will tell you from a global standpoint, but we're seeing a very continued -- that the macro economy continues to be constructive although uncertainties have been introduced clearly with the -- in the geopolitical area. With everything going on that we read in the news. Now it's too soon is that -- what that impact is going to be on the macro level. From what's important though on a year -- from a year ago basis we continue to see strength in industrial and automotive, as Dave highlighted in his prepared remarks. Personal electronics grew across several sectors and while communications equipment declined, it was [above reasonable] sequentially. Dave. Dave Pahl : I think Vivek when you look at the quarter with revenue increasing 11%, the demand continuing to remain strong in both industrial and automotive and I just described that demand is continuing to be very broad-based. So I think that speaks to you. One of our competitive advantages which is diversity and longevity of products, so we're certainly benefiting from that today. Do you have a follow on, Vivek? Vivek Arya : CapEx its up 42% on a trailing 12 month basis running ahead of revenue growth that's closer to 5% or 6% up there versus the 4% target. I'm curious why is CapEx growing so much faster when you're only 50% utilized in your 300 millimeter factory? I mean should we look at growing CapEx as a sign of confidence in demand or at what point should we be worried that maybe you are going to buy too much inventory? Rafael Lizardi : I will give you a few -- a few things on that. First most importantly let's step back and think about what is the purpose of CapEx. We talked about this during our capital management strategy a couple of months ago. In CapEx our objective there is to support technology development and revenue growth. We want to expand our low cost manufacturing advantage specially to the 300 millimeter where the only analog company with its own 300 millimeter factory and what that does at the end of the day is allow us to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth. So that's what the ultimate objective is. The CapEx percent of revenue that's just a general guide that we gave. And on that our sense is that 4% that could vary depending on what's going on in the marketplace, because of very strong demand, when we are expanding capacity, that could run off. And right now on a trailing 12 months basis 4.9%. But of course the reason that would run off is that we see opportunities to continue expanding our technology development and our low cost manufacturing advantage so that ultimately we drive long-term growth of our free cash flow per share. Dave Pahl : Thank you, for that and we can go to the next caller please. Operator : We will take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : First I wanted to ask about OpEx, in Q1 it was -- it grew but probably a little less than with ordinarily be typical sequentially. Were there any specific drivers to that maybe push out of spend maybe into Q2 and I guess along those lines Q2 OpEx would usually up a little bit? Any change that we should expect from what will be typical there? Rafael Lizardi : On OpEx on first quarter, it came in about as expected and we continue to be pleased with how we are allocating capital to OpEx in general, specifically to our R&D as it continues to drive growth in the top line and we continue to gain market share. On the subsequent quarter as you know, we gave a range on revenue and EPS we don't give in between the lines. If there was something unusual going on we would point that out, we are not pointing out because there is nothing unusual going on in between those lines. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-on Stacy? Stacy Rasgon : I wanted to ask about the [Technical Difficulty] grew year-over-year. I was also surprised just given what we've heard from other players in that space right now. Could you give us a little more color, I think you said like in certain segments could you give us a little more color about what's actually going on under the covers in personal electronics? And I guess, whether or not you see the current trends actually extending into next quarter given what is going on in the supply chain? Rafael Lizardi : Let me talk about this quarter that we are reporting and wait for second quarter results to go through the details there. We described that we saw growth across several sectors and several customers, so you know that we tried to point out there it is not just the insets that are growing there are other things are growing inside of that. And I will describe the growth as somewhere in the mid to single-digit. So good growth, especially for a sector like personal electronics. Long-term of course, we think that we will see auto and industrial driver business that where we've been allocating increasingly our capital too. And that's just the belief that those will be the two areas that will drive growth not just for us but certainly in our industry overall. Operator : Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : On inventory Dave I think Q1 inventory grew about 4% sequentially. I think days inventory grew a little bit as well. Can you describe how you guys see internal inventory today? And if you can comment on the channel, where you guys are seeing the channel that will be helpful as well? Rafael Lizardi : I'll talk about internal inventory and then Dave will talk about channel inventory. But on inventory let me step back again and refer you to our long-term objective that we talked about at the capital management call. What do we want inventory for? The objective of our inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence, improve our manufacturing asset utilization and we also see value in controlling that inventory, having more of it in our own product distribution centers, more in consignment, more in low-volume buffers. I talked about this at the capital management call as well as 90 days ago when we closed the last quarter and this topic came up. So we're very pleased where our inventory ended up. From a day space as it was 136 days, from a year ago that's up 4 days, sequentially is up 2 days and is well within our 115, 145 day inventory basement. Dave Pahl : And Toshiya from a channel standpoint inventory remains at about 4 weeks and I will just as a reminder for those that are not familiar as Rafael pointed out there is -- we believe that there is value in owning and controlling our own inventory, and actual result is in the consignment program. So, about 65% of our distribution revenue is shipped through a consignment program, so that 4 weeks really represents maybe half to third of what many of our peers will run in the channel. So we feel that's a good level. That combined with the inventory positions that we have on our books. Do you have a follow on Toshiya? Toshiya Hari : I do thank you. So on communications equipment specifically I think 3 months ago, you guys talked about the business being a little bit choppy and today I guess you told us that revenues were down year-over-year and flattish sequentially. At what point would you this expect this business to revert to growth, is that sort of in the second half of '18 given lower comps or do we need to wait longer for this business to start growing again? Dave Pahl : Yeah so I won't try to predict what the back half of the growth for comms equipment will look like. As you mentioned and you have been following the industry long enough you know that factor is just choppy the way that operators place orders and the OEMs have to build inventories to respond to that. That doesn't make it a bad business. It is just the nature of it and there will be more communications equipment shift in the coming years. So we have got a great position today in 4G products. We will have a great position in 5G products and really any time trying to figure out when that mix will begin to shift and we will just enjoy the demand as it comes in. All right we will go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question will come from with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Why don't you just talk about what you're seeing, you mentioned channel inventory. If you can speak to your customer's inventory a little bit and I guess we've seen shortages of things outside of your space like passives and embedded memory and things like that. Is that causing any change to your customer's inventory behavior in your business either because they have inventory waiting for those things are in shortage or are they holding more of a buffer or is it sort of business as usual? Dave Pahl : I would say that we got no indications of inventories growing or double orders for that matter, which history suggests also and very quickly pointing out that you never really see that ahead of time. So I think with that said I think it is always important to qualify what we can see. So we've got good visibility in the distribution inventories that I talked about earlier, good portion of that remains on consignment. So we will actually hold the inventory on our books. Our visibility in the customer inventories varies -- really it depends on whether we've got consignment or not. So with consignment OEMs we are carrying that inventory, on our books. And we are not seeing anything that I would describe as unusual signals things like expedites and things like that would suggest that there would be some other broader issue. Now our visibility inventory beyond our customer's manufacturing operations of course is very low. So our lead times remain stable. Of course, we always have hot spots, we work aggressively with customers to close and other metrics like cancellations, reschedules those also remain at very low levels. So those are the things that we can see and we can measure. And for a long time we will just try to keep doing what we have been doing which is with our manufacturing and internal inventory strategies we just stay focused on keeping those lead times stable. And more importantly delivery metrics very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence that they can get support from us when they need it. You have follow on Joe? Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Danley with Citigroup. Chris Danley : First question just a quick one. So sequentially revenue increased the gross margins were down a bit, can you comment on why that happened? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, when you look at gross margin fall through which kind of was embedding your question there, in any one sequential transition particularly when revenue was about flat is up 1% is difficult to do that analysis and make -- have anything meaningful come out of that. You probably want to look at it on a year-on-year basis and on that basis our gross margin, gross profit margin increased 160 basis points the fall through was about 78%. And that's along the lines of what we have guided all of you before that on a long-term basis that falls through that you should expect from our revenue gross should be between 70% to 75%. Chris Danley : Yes, so my follow-up. You never said but the tax rate continues to go down. Can you just talk about your plans for this extra cash? Is it possible I know you usually raise the dividend sometime around August or September? Is it possible or feasible you could raise the dividend twice this year? Why not crank up the buyback a little bit more, I think you took your share count down by just a couple of million around that? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, let me step back and talk about cash return and how we think about that and then how we think about dividends and repurchases. From a cash return standpoint our objective to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. And we have been doing that for a number of years. In fact on a trailing 12 month basis we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow and we have returned $5.1 billion of free cash flow. So we are doing that. Now obviously we do that in two ways, dividends or repurchases. From a dividend standpoint we want to provide sustainable and growing dividend. As of the end of last year we have been growing that dividend 24% on a compounded basis for the previous five years, and at the end of last year also on a trailing 12 month basis that's 45% of free cash flow. So that underscores the sustainability. On the repurchases, we just got done repurchasing $873 million of our own stock and our objective there is accretive capture of the future free cash for the long-term owners of the company. So we just resell our assumptions to extrapolate estimate what we think our free cash flow growth is going to be and then based on that we come up with different scenarios and valuation as well as the market prices below those scenarios, we buy back the stock and that's what you have seen us do for a numbers of years now and we will continue doing that. Dave Pahl : Okay thank you. Chris, we will go to our next caller, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : Actually maybe I could just follow-up on the last question on gross margin, made on guide specifically in for June but just kind of similar question. Sequential growth in the June, what's the way to think about gross margin is there any segment to think about mix wise or such as to why the gross margin will be up? Rafael Lizardi : I will just tell you of course for, whenever you in fact hear a specific projection on that we give the revenue range and an EPS range. But the bigger picture on that is that; a, we continue to drive revenue growth and that's the biggest contributor to free cash flow growth. And then in addition to that we continue on increasing our loadings on 300 millimeter, which has 40% cost advantage, that's one of our competitive advantages. We're the only Analog company with own 300 millimeter factory. So every time we build an incremental wafer on 300 millimeter we have better fall through on that. We have better free cash flow per share growth. So we will continue to do that for the foreseeable future and even beyond the current capacity of [those taxes]. Blayne Curtis : Just in the March quarter you saw a good strength in embedded and particularly processors wondering if you can just speak about that strength in terms of end market or particular product discussed will be helpful? Dave Pahl : If you look at embedded overall and processors specifically they have a very high exposure to industrial and automotive. So that growth is really coming from very diverse places. It will -- connected microcontrollers also grew very nicely as well and again that includes our connectivity products there and they are doing quite well and we are encouraged because that growth is coming from diverse places which I think gives us confidence in the long-term ability of that portion of our business to continue to grow. Okay Thank you. Blayne we will go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montreal. Ambrish Srivastava : Thank you very much Dave, Rafael, I apologize if I had missed it. What were the orders for the quarter? Dave Pahl : Our orders for the quarter were up about 11% year on year and that put our book to bill about 1.03 and whenever I give a book to bill I always try to remind everyone that we get about 60% of our revenues that go on consignment. So we don't carry backlog, we get orders running up to the quarter they all want -- they have the new revenue [cap-ins]. So always be cautious on both of those numbers. You have a follow on Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes I did and thanks for the color. Geo wise, was there any geos that stood out as stronger, weaker as you went through the quarter? Thank you. Dave Pahl : So from a geo standpoint we had revenue up in three of the four regions from a year ago. So Asia was up followed by the U.S. and Europe, Japan is down. And a couple of comments, so first, I'll make the comments that that is measured by where we ship the product and not where it's consumed. So usually our regional shipments don't often reflect the broader macro in a particular region. And the second thing then I'll add is from a Japan standpoint we are seeing that companies in Japan are building products in other regions of the world. So as products get designed in Japan they actually may be produced in other regions, so I wouldn't look too much on that as well. Okay. Thank you Ambrish and we will go to the next caller, please. Operator : We will take a question from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Chris Caso : Just a question on what you saw as perhaps better and worse in the quarter and it looks like the revenues came in a little better than you had expected? Can you talk about what was the driver of that? Dave Pahl : Yes, Chris, so revenues came in within our expectations for the quarter. Certainly they are in the upper half of our expectations. And I'd just say that of course that was driven by industrial and automotive. And I just say that strength we saw very, very broadly. So there wasn't one specific thing that we point to. And I think again that highlights one of those competitive advantages of diversity in line with positions. That we can see that kind of strength and it comes through and shows up even on the top line. You have a follow-up? Chris Caso : I do, thank you. And I guess that we've been in a situation where business conditions have been stable if not pretty good for a while. I know you guys have been doing this a while, whenever the things are good in semis we wonder how long it's going to last. Can you talk about perhaps what we're seeing now? What perhaps is different than what we have seen in past cycles? Are there things that TI is doing differently? Is there things within the industry that are different as compared to last cycles such that things would be more stable now? Rafael Lizardi : What I'm going to point out for this question is that we are now a much larger company in terms of industrial and automotive. Our percent of revenue is as of the end of last year was 54%. You go back a few years ago, that number was sub 40%. And that provides inherent stability to our revenue because our revenue comes from many, many customers, many, many sectors within industrial and many -- in equipment. Now does that mean that we would be immune from a correction? I think a correction would short-term or in medium term would affect all those sectors but the important point is that longer-term this is the place where we want to be, because this is in both of those end markets automotive and industrial. That's where the company is growing. So, even if there is -- when there is a correction and we go through that the end point down the road 10, 15, 20 years from now still the same which is more and more content in those end markets. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Chris, and we've got time for one more caller operator. Operator : We will take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. Romit Shah : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Hey guys. So just following up on the last question, Rafael if I look at the five and 10 year averages for revenue growth, Q1 has been down low to mid single-digits, Q2 and Q3 have been up high singles and then Q4 has been kind down the most. Given your enhanced exposure to industrial and automotive, do you still think those averages are good guideposts for us as we forecast your business or do you think it's different now? Dave Pahl : Romit I will take a shot at that. I think that when we look at seasonality, I would remind you that we still have a very nice calculator business that has a strong seasonal pattern with the back to school. So that along with the balance of the semiconductor business in the past has been stronger in the second and third quarters. So as you know for seasonality in general, that makes second and third quarters stronger than the first and fourth quarters. If you look at those sequential changes you will see that you can take an average of them but the lot of the last five or 10 years is a very, very wide range of numbers that are in there. So when we look at it, we just talk about seasonality in those two quarters. Do you have a follow on? Romit Shah : Yes, thanks for that, just on R&D in the last several years in Q1, R&D has gone up by about 20 million to 25 million, this Q1 R&D was down 1 million. I know that in 2016 R&D grew faster than revenues and then it grew about in line with revenues in 2017. Just given what we've seen so far year-to-date is it reasonable to assume that we might see more R&D leverage this year versus the last couple of years? Rafael Lizardi : We are pleased that we're allocating capital to R&D, even SG&A and CapEx and ultimately to drive a top line growth in market share. We do that based on long-term expectations on growth particularly industrial and automotive as I talked about earlier given how well our portfolio matches those markets. So we will continue to do that. And if we have opportunities to increase R&D because we have even better opportunities we will do that, if not we will keep it about where it is but we don't have any said percent increase or number to give you. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you Romit and with that we will wrap up the call. Thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. David Pahl : Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will also be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. You likely saw last week we announced that Rich Templeton had resumed the roles of President and CEO along with his current role as Chairman. Rich has successfully led TI for the past 14 years, and under his continuing leadership we look forward to making TI even stronger and better. I've met with Rich several times over the last couple of weeks and I can tell you he's excited to be back. He'll be attending several conferences in the near future and will be meeting with investors over the next few months. As you might imagine, he's fully engaged and busy doing what he does best, and that's executing our strategy, strengthening our competitive advantages, and running our operations with laser focus. Turning to this quarter's results, I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the second quarter increased 9% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 12% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 9% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.40, including a $0.03 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. With that backdrop I'll provide some details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing twelve-month period was $5.7 billion, up 42% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 36.6% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing twelve-month period, we returned $5.6 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners remains unchanged. I\u2019ll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago quarter, analog revenue grew 12% due to Power and Signal Chain [ph]. High volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased 9% from the year-ago quarter due to about equal growth in both processors and connected microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 7% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC. Now I\u2019ll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive demand remained strong due to broad based growth. We continue to be pleased with our investments, which are directed across fourteen sectors in industrial and five sectors in automotive and continue to deliver broad based and diverse revenue growth. Personal electronics grew low-single digits with increases across several sectors and customers. These increases were offset by declines at some customers. Communication equipment declined from a year ago and declined low-to -mid single-digit sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew. In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.62 billion or 65.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 90 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $825 million, a 2% increase from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing twelve-month basis, operating expenses were 20.6% of revenue within our range of expectations. Over the last twelve months, we have invested $1.53 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top-line and gain market share. Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then declined to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Operating profit was $1.71 billion or 42.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 16% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47% up from 44.7% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 35.4% up from 31.2% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second quarter was $1.41 billion or $1.40 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.83 billion in the quarter. It increased $909 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower tax rate as well as higher revenue, which includes more 300-millimeter analog revenue. Capital expenditures were $249 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.73 billion on a trailing twelve-month basis, up 42% from a year ago. In the second quarter, we paid $606 million in dividends, and repurchased $1.02 billion of our own stock for a total return of $1.62 billion in the second quarter. We have returned $5.6 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remained strong with $5.13 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we retired $0.5 billion of debt as it became due andraised $1.5 billion of 30 year debt with a coupon of 4.15%. We currently have total debt of $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 135, up 2 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.11 billion to $4.45 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.63, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to non-cash charges. More details of our expectations for taxes can be found on our website under Financial Summary Data. In closing, I will know that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years from top-line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our comparative advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. David Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, we can now open up the lines for questions in order to provide as many of you possible the opportunity to ask your question please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we\u2019ll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Thank you, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. So, David, my first question is just on the high volume analog segment. I think in your prepared comments, you had mentioned that\u2019s declined year-over-year in the June quarter. I\u2019m kind of curious to what extent was that by choice as you pruned the portfolio, to what extent do you think that that's just a handset phenomenon as it builds last year for product cycles more robust than this year? And to what extent do you feel that might be a leading indicator for maybe some excess in the \u201ccycle\u201d? David Pahl : Yeah, John, thanks for asking that question. I think what we're seeing there is a result of how we've been allocating our resources in R&D. And if you remember back in February in our Capital Management Calls, we went through that. We've got a pretty disciplined process. And essentially, what we're trying to do is steer more money to long-lived revenue opportunities where we've got some level of differentiation and we'll have that for some time. So, you know, I think when you look at the results overall, revenue grew 12% year-over-year. That\u2019s inclusive of what happened inside of high volume. And again, I think that that's a result of allocating resources to the best sustainable opportunities. If you drop down into there in the prepared comments, obviously industrial and automotive continue to do well. Inside of HVAL, you would see that industrial and automotive did well as well. It just doesn't make up as much of a percentage of that revenue. So anyway we're pleased with that outcome and not surprised by it. Do you have a follow-on, John? John Pitzer : Yeah, and then Rafael as my follow-on, I know it's probably better to look at the business trends on a year-over-year basis rather than sequential and on a year-over-year you showed really good operating margin leverage in the embedded business. But sequentially it was flat on op revenue and there's still that gap between embedded op margins and analog op margins. How do you think about the leverage in the embedded market from here? And will we ever close that gap between embedded and analog? Rafael Lizardi : So, let me step back and take you back to our capital management strategy and some of the things that we say there and how we think about driving value for owners of the company. And to us, it all comes down to growing free cash flow per share. So it's not operating margins, it\u2019s not gross margin, it's not analog versus embedded, it's all about growing free cash flow per share. Both of those businesses are and we expect to continue to be contributors to that free cash flow per share. So the focus is growing the top-line. As we continue to invest in what we think are the best markets, the industrial and automotive, and in the case of analog as we continue to expand our 300-millimeter footprint where we have a structural cost advantage. David Pahl : Okay, now we\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : And we have Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you very much. I had a question on the guidance. The June numbers were a little bit below seasonal and I know that seasonal is hard to really figure out what's actually normal. But that was kind of coming off more difficult Q1 comps. But if I look at the September quarter guidance, it's a few hundred basis points below seasonal and it's up like 300 basis points year-over-year, which is you know the lowest in a couple of years. Is there any element of more difficult comps or is there in fact some kind of channel inventory headwinds? Thank you. David Pahl : Yeah, Tim, I just say that when we put together our guidance, the two strongest signals that we see are orders that we get from customers as well as the demand fees that we get through our consignment programs. And I would just say that if there is something specific to call out as we have in the past, if there was a specific customer or specific end market or something like that that was changing, we would let you know about that. And as example lead times remain stable, cancellations remain low, reschedules remain low. We look at inventory and the channels and that remained steady at about four weeks. So we really don't see any changes from that standpoint. And the other thing as you pointed out when you look at a couple of data points, it's hard to describe what is exactly seasonal. And so if you look over the last five years, we've had a 9% sequential growth. Three of those five years has been at 6%. And if you look over a ten year period, it's 7%. So certainly our guidance from a seasonal standpoint is certainly within the range of things that we've seen in the past. Do you have a follow on? Timothy Arcuri : Thanks and then I guess just as a quick follow on. Dave, can you give what orders and book to bill were? David Pahl : I can give that. Let me just find it. Yeah, so orders, book to bill \u2013 orders were up 10% sequentially, book to bill was 1.06. I'll point out it was 1.06 a year ago and 1.03 last quarter. I always feel the need to comment on book to bill with about 60% of our revenue going through consignment programs where we don't get any orders in advance of pull from that demand. So the book to bill isn't as strong of a signal or is at least as clear of a signal as what it used to be in the past. So thank you, Tim. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : And we'll take our next caller from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Hey, guys. David Pahl : Hi, Ross. Ross Seymore : Let me ask you a question. Dave, just want to ask about from \u2013 not necessarily a cyclical point of view, but from a macro point of view. With all the discussion of trade wars, tariffs, et cetera, I know you haven't called out seeing anything further, your answer to the last question, but just how does TI in general think about that dynamic as potentially impacting your business? And are you, in fact, seeing any impact as of yet? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, Ross, I will go ahead and take that. First, let me take TI's long-term support of free trade and strong IP protection. And those are both important to TI and the broader ST industry. So we continue \u2013 we feel that way. We have stated, we had been in that position for a long time and we continue to do that and advocate that. Specifically on the tariffs that have been announced on integrated circuits, those are still subject to public comment through the end of July, so those are not in place yet. If \u2013 once they go into effect or if they go into effect, remember, they will apply to goods that are deemed of Chinese origin that are then imported into the United States. For TI, only about 13% of our revenue is imported into the United States. In other words, 87% of our revenue is exports, so not subject to U.S. tariffs. And that 13%, only a sliver of that has Chinese origin as a \u2013 would be deemed as Chinese origin. So bottom line, only about 1% of our revenue would have those tariffs applied to it. And that's before we make any potential \u2013 any adjustments, supply chain and other things that we could do to even minimize that impact further. So at the end of the day, we don't see a major event or any direct impact other than some minimal impact. Now, that's not to say that at a macro level, that could have an impact, but that's a very macro comment that goes beyond TI and beyond the semiconductor industry that free trade \u2013 anything against free trade between the two largest economies in the world, that could eventually have a macro effect that would be detrimental to everybody. David Pahl : Do you have follow on, Ross? Ross Seymore : Yeah, I do. Just switching back to your product segments, it seemed like Analog sequentially was pretty much in line what we've seen for the last few years, but Embedded was lower and Other was much higher than what we've seen. And I know you guys think of things year-over-year, but if we look at it sequentially, is there any reasons behind the Embedded being lower and the Other being so much higher? David Pahl : Yeah, I think if you look at Embedded, it has a higher percentage of comms equipment. So it was impacted by that. And then in Other, don't forget that we've got strong seasonality in second and third quarter. So, thank you, Ross, for those questions. And we will go to the next caller please. Operator : We have our next question from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. I guess, two questions for me as well. Maybe first off, could you quantify the revenue impact you had from \u2013 not your word, mine \u2013 but product rationalization or product optimization that you guys went through in the June quarter? And does that revenue headwind, if you may, flow into the September quarter as well to some degree? David Pahl : Amit, can you clarify what you mean by product rationalization? Amit Daryanani : Yes. I think, Dave, when you talked about the consumer-centric markets, you talked about how some of the revenue declines there were driven by the fact that you just decided not to participate in some of these markets, a reflection of how your R&D budgets are tracked over time. Is that fair? And if so, I guess, how much was that revenue impact driven by? David Pahl : Well, I think, if you look and we shared this back in February on our Capital Management Call. As we looked at allocating resources across end markets and specifically in personal electronics, when you compare our spend there versus five and ten years ago, it's lower. Now, it's not zero. There's still good opportunities that we find inside of personal electronics and continue to invest. We're just looking for sustainable growth opportunities inside of that space. So that's really what we're talking about. So again, I think the first question came in specifically about one of the businesses inside of our Analog segment. I think you have to judge the efficiency of our capital allocation by the total results. And that, we're quite pleased with. So does that help to answer your question? Amit Daryanani : No, that's helpful. And I guess, if I could just follow-up, you guys have had multiple quarters of gross margin expansion, very consistent on a year-over-year basis. As you think about the back half of 2018, can you maybe talk about what are the levers that could enable gross margins to continue to expand from here? And do you feel comfortable that gross margin should expand in the back half? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, I\u2019ll go ahead and take that Amit. As we have talked about in Capital Management and in other settings, our focus for value creation for the owners of the company is free cash flow per share. It's not gross margin. It's not operating margin. It's dollars of free cash flow per share. So the opportunity for expanding that and continuing to grow that are simple. It's the top line as we continue to invest in the best products and the best markets and the best markets because that's where the semiconductor content is expanding and we continue to gain share there. And then, 300-millimeter. We have talked about that for a number of years. As of last year, about $4 billion of our revenue went through 300-millimeter, four out of ten in the Analog space. So that leaves a lot of room for continued expansion on 300-millimeter and continuing to grow that free cash flow per share. David Pahl : Okay, thank you, Amit. And we will go the next caller please. Operator : We will take our next question from Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Harlan Sur : Yes, good afternoon. Solid job on the quarterly execution and strong free cash flow generation. Your focused markets, automotive, you've got 5 subsegments. Industrial, you've got 14 subsegments. Can you guys just give us a sense on the breadth of the year-over-year growth in these markets? Were a majority of these subsegments up year-over-year? Any color here would be helpful. David Pahl : Yeah, Harlan, when you look at that growth, we're really pleased with it. It\u2019s very broad based. And when you look at all of the sectors, out of the 19 combined that we had, 18 of them actually grew. So it\u2019s very broad-based. I think when you look across different products, different investments and we look at our design-ins in our pipeline, that \u2013 those continue to be very broad-based. So that gives us confidence in the sustainability of that growth. And of course, it doesn't mean that we won't see cyclical headwinds at some point. But when you look at it from a five and ten year standpoint, we feel really good about the progress that we have made. Do you have follow-on, Harlan? Harlan Sur : Yeah, thanks for the insights there. And so kind of to follow-up on that maybe from a geographical perspective, right? I think last quarter, all regions \u2013 and I know this is ship to, right? This is ship to data, but still, nevertheless important, but last quarter I think all regions were up except for Japan. What did you see this quarter? David Pahl : That is the same story. And my friends in Japan, I've talked to them a couple of times. They're \u2013 give them a shout-out to them that the revenue is down, but when you look at \u2013 we've got some reporting tools that allow us to look through what we call channel independent reporting. And as you mentioned, it's a ship to. So they're continuing to make progress with the customers there. Just a lot of that revenue ends up shipping either somewhere in Asia or it ships in Europe or in the U.S. even though it's designed in there. So \u2013 but the actual measurement that we have is the shipping label on the box. So unfortunately, they're still called out on the conference call, which I know they're not happy about. So thank you, Harlan. And we will go to the next caller please. Operator : And we will take our next question from bank of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the good execution. For the first one, your CapEx is now \u2013 I think it was over 6% in Q2, I think, trailing four quarters, it's 5.5%. Depreciation is now below CapEx. So where are all these incremental investments going? And what is the right long-term model we should assume for CapEx and depreciation? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, let me take that. First let me step back to remind you what the objective is, right, for CapEx. It's to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth and specifically to extend our low-cost manufacturing advantage, including 300-millimeter, which maximizes our opportunity to grow free cash flow per share for the long-term. So the percent of revenue is an interesting metric to have in mind, but the real driver is that long-term growth of free cash flow per share. So we have been \u2013 and in periods of sustained strong demand, that CapEx tends to go up and that's part of what you're seeing. That CapEx is going to \u2013 is going primarily to support 300-millimeter. There are other things. There's assembly test. There's even other factories where we invest some of that CapEx, but predominantly, it's to continue to expand that footprint of 300-millimeter within our fab and building cost at the existing factories. Before you go to the next question, I want to go ahead and make a point on free cash flow on our free cash flow growth. In the trailing 12 months, free cash flow grew $1.7 billion from about $4 billion to $5.7 billion, a 42% increase. So what would that drew \u2013 what drove that? First and foremost, our profit before tax grew about $1 billion in that comparison. So that is higher revenue, more revenue driven by industrial and automotive, which, again, drove the majority of the revenue growth; and more 300-millimeter, which, to the question earlier, that continues to help with the expansion of free cash flow. And then second and obviously, tax reform. So in the United States, we had a \u2013 we have tax reform and, as we have talked about, that did lower our tax rate in 2018 versus the previous year in a significant way. Additionally, we had about $200 million of year-to-date of one-time tax related benefits that are also associated with tax reform. So that also played a factor in that comparison. David Pahl : Okay, so with that Vivek do you have a follow-up? Vivek Arya : Yeah, thanks, Dave. Beyond just the trade issue, I know there has been talk of shortages of passive components. I know you guys don't supply that, but your other peers do. But have you seen your customers behave in a different way, stock up, stock down on various things that might impact your trajectory just because your customers might be short of other components to help complete their systems? David Pahl : Yeah, Vivek, I think one-thing that we have spend a lot of time trying to do and remain focused on is keeping lead time stable. And for the vast majority of our products, they continue to remain stable. And that doesn't mean that we don't have hotspots and, of course, we'll work with customers to close those gaps as aggressively as we can. And the other important metric that we look in inside of that is on-time shipping performance. So you've got a stated lead time and if you're not shipping inside of that, customers tend to get nervous. And that has continued to remain at very, very high levels. So we can't see any bottlenecks from customers not being able to get product from other places that shows up in the order book specifically. Could it be there? It certainly could be, but it's not something that we would have visibility into. So I think if we just remain focused on what we can control, which is the lead times and shipping performance, customers can have confidence in getting product from us. Okay, we will go to the next caller please. Operator : And we will take our next question from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is ask about the near-term OpEx trajectory. Normally in Q3, you'd probably be down a little bit sequentially. Is there any drivers or anything that could be going on that would make things into this Q3 different than what we might ordinarily have seen given, I guess, some of the historical trends that we've seen leading into this? Rafael Lizardi : So, Stacy, as you know, we give revenue guidance and EPS guidance and stop it at that unless there were any unusual trends and if so \u2013 right between the lines, and if so, we would point that out. We're not pointing that out because there's nothing unusual. So you should expect just our usual trends within reasonable ranges. David Pahl : Do you have follow-on, Stacy? Stacy Rasgon : I do, thank you. There\u2019s earlier question on CapEx. And we know it's elevated now because you guys are out looking for other assets. At the same time, obviously, as you continue to grow, you're filling out 300-millimeter and that's a margin benefit. Do you think, over time, the benefit from increasing penetration of 300-millimeter more than offsets the depreciation expense on your gross margins? Rafael Lizardi : Well, so the way I like to look at this is from a cash standpoint. So I think of that investment as cash flowing out, the first cell on your spreadsheet, and then after that is return. I don't think about it for those purposes from a depreciation standpoint. So as we continue to invest on 300, we think that is \u2013 those are very good, long-term investments that will last for a long time. Any time we put any of these tools in place and the cash fall-through on those investments is pretty high. David Pahl : Okay, thank you very much, Stacy. And I think we have time for one more caller. Operator : And we have one more question from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Great, thank you. You said that some of your personal electronics markets were up and some were down. Can you give me a bit more color on which? And I know smartphones, in particular, I think grew in Q1 as smartphones continue to grow into Q2? Thanks. David Pahl : Yeah, Joe, I won\u2019t go into that level of detail. We did want to give some color on what was going on inside of personal electronics that we see \u2013 we saw multiple sectors growing inside of there. We had some customers that were growing, but also wanted to point out not all customers were growing. So that's what we saw. I think what that illustrates is the power of having a diverse product portfolio and being able to sell to multiple customers. And kind of to my point earlier, we look at the opportunity inside of personal electronics. Longer term, we don't see that as a significant growth engine for us, but it is a place that we continue to invest and we really believe the majority of the growth is really going to come from industrial and automotive. So incrementally, as we've taken up our spend, we've moved it more into those growth areas. So \u2013 but again, we're going to have handsets and PCs and those other things for decades to come. So we just find good opportunities inside of there and want to continue to invest in them. Do you have follow-on, Joe? Joe Moore : Yeah, thanks for the color there. In terms of longer-term question on communication infrastructure, obviously, it's been soft for everyone in the last few quarters. How do you think about the 5G opportunity? I think the comment that you've made just now and repeatedly that the investment areas are industrial and automotive. Do you think there's an opportunity around 5G that you need to invest in? And just to help us understand how that will affect TI. David Pahl : Sure, yeah, so I think again I would refer back to our capital management presentation as we walked through that thinking remains consistent with that. So from a comms equipment standpoint, I would say that our investments have shifted over time. If you look at the 5G standards and the things needed to support the new things, new frequencies being added, things like the massive MIMO, antennas that are going in for beamforming and other things like that, that is all complexity that you find in the radio itself. And for us, that translates into Analog products to be able to support that. So our spend in Analog is up for supporting that 5G transition. It has been for some time when we look at our spend versus, say, 5 and 10 years ago. But at the same time, that same change in standards and mix really doesn't impact the digital side. So our spend actually is down on that. So again, I'd describe our growth primarily coming from industrial and automotive as we look over the next decade. So that's where we've tried to increase spending, but we will shift spending around to take advantage of things like 5G. And I'd just say that, in general, very confident in our position. And we've got \u2013 we're building off of a great position inside of 4G as well. So we're very pleased with those investments. Rafael Lizardi : So, that was the last call? David Pahl : Correct. A - Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, so before we close, I just want to make a point because it wasn't asked, but our results, among other things, demonstrate our continued discipline and execution on capital management strategy. We generated on a trailing 12-month basis $5.7 billion of free cash flow and we would return $5.6 billion of free cash flow in that timeframe. So virtually, all free cash flow generated was returned to the owners of the company. That was both through dividends and buybacks. In the case of dividends, on that comparison, it was 41% of free cash flow. So right between 40% and 60% guidance, but clearly towards the lower end, so I'd just underscore the sustainability of those dividends. David Pahl : Okay, thank you, Rafael and thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Texas Instruments\u2019 Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. David Pahl : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I\u2019ll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 4% from a year ago; however, demand for our products slowed across most markets during the quarter. Earnings per share were $1.58. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 8% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 4% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Analog and Embedded performed about the same directionally within most end markets, with communications equipment as the exception. In communications equipment, Analog products saw double-digit growth, which included early 5G product ramps, while Embedded products declined from a year ago, as we expected. Without the decline in communications equipment, Embedded would have grown. With that backdrop, I\u2019ll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 40% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 37.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that\u2019s long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $6.2 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24%, and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion, taken together these reflect our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to our owners. I\u2019ll provide some details by segment. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 8% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue decreased by 4% from the year-ago quarter due to Processors. Connected Microcontrollers was about even. In our Other segment, revenue declined 6% primarily due to custom products, as we expected. Now, I\u2019ll provide some insight into this quarter\u2019s performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand slowed to upper-single digit growth with most sectors growing year-on-year. Automotive grew double-digits from a year ago, but the growth slowed from previous quarters. We continue to focus our investments across 14 sectors in industrial and five sectors in automotive. We believe these investments will continue to deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth over the long-term. Personal electronics declined mid-single digits as increases at some customers were offset by declines at others. Communications equipment increased low-single digits from a year ago as Analog, which included early 5G product ramps I mentioned earlier grew and was offset by declines in Embedded. And lastly, enterprise systems grew. In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content. And these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion or 65.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 130 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $786 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.55 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share. Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Operating profit was $1.94 billion or 45.5% of revenue. Operating profit was up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 49.8%, up from 47% a year ago, and for Embedded Processing was 34.6%, down from 34.9% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over the long-term. Net income in the third quarter was $1.57 billion or $1.58 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.11 billion in the quarter. It increased $384 million from the year-ago quarter primarily due to a lower tax rate and higher revenue, which includes more 300 millimeter Analog revenue. Capital expenditures were $370 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.93 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 40% from a year ago. In the third quarter, we paid $602 million in dividends and repurchased $1.2 billion of our stock for a total return of $1.8 billion in the third quarter. We have returned $6.23 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. As Dave mentioned already, in September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24%, and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.62 to $0.77, or $3.08 annualized. This is our 15th consecutive year of dividend increases, and over the past 5 years we have increased the quarterly dividend by a compounded average rate of 21%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $18.2 billion at the end of third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.11 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt is $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 131, up 13 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. In the third quarter, we began the next phase of our consignment program with our distributors and implementation will continue through the end of 2019. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.34. We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and about 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to non-cash charges. To help you with your model for 2019, we are providing the quarterly discrete tax benefits and tax rates for the year. We expect a discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters, and $5 million in the fourth. Therefore, the effective tax rate would be 15% for the first quarter and 16% in the second, third and fourth quarters. These details of our expectations for taxes can also be found on the IR website under Financial Summary Data. In closing, the strength of our business model has been demonstrated over the past 15 years through up and down markets. We are heading into a softer market, and we plan to execute as we have in the past : First, we will be disciplined with our operating plan. We will reduce wafer starts; however, inventory days will rise above our range as we strategically build low-volume, long-lived products and implement the latest phase of our consignment program. Second, we will continue our R&D investment levels and plans, which have a long-term focus. Third, we will be thoughtful with SG&A. There are important areas of investments that increase our competitive advantages, like our demand-creation initiative, and these would remain unchanged. In other areas of SG&A, we will be prudent as appropriate. And lastly, we are planning our next phase of 300 millimeter capacity expansion to be available as soon as 2020 or 2021. A slowdown will have little effect on our timing to get the next 300 millimeter factory shell in place. In conclusion, we are focused on the best products Analog and Embedded Processing and the best markets industrial and automotive, which will enable us to grow free cash flow per share for a long time to come. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. David Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys, thank you for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about drivers of gross margin in the next quarter. You mentioned a few things, you\u2019re going to reduce wafer starts but inventory days are also going to rise. You mentioned your 300-millimeter next phase is coming on, which suggests CapEx continues to be elevated so depreciation goes up. I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on the different drivers as we get into Q4 and how should think about those drivers evolving into 2019 and beyond as some of them are longer-term? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, Stacy, let me take that. The big picture of fall-through on our revenue is the same as it has been before. 70% to 75% is what we have talked about and that applies on going up, it also applies going down. So that\u2019s what we would expect. Of course, that is over the long haul. So any one quarter, it could be a little different. The other thing I would tell you, obviously, when we are increasing wafer starts, that is a help for gross margins and when we\u2019re decreasing wafer starts, it\u2019s a headwind on gross margins. And so you will see that and you should expect that. You have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon : Yes. So I guess, how do you continue to build inventory going forward if you\u2019re reducing wafer starts? How does that work? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So it depends on how much you reduce wafer starts depending on the revenue change, right? And also it depends on the timing of that. Wafers cycle times can be anywhere between 12 to 16 weeks. It doesn\u2019t change on a dime. But the key point on keeping those, the wafer starts, at a level that even though we are reducing them, but we can still build those long-lived inventory buffers for industrial and automotive. Those are low risk buffers. Those parts live for a long, long time and they enable us to then support our customers on the other side of this slowdown. So overall, it\u2019s just a better way and a smart way to allocate our capital. David Pahl : Yes. And I\u2019ll just add to that, Stacy, that not only will we build that strategic inventory of low-volume parts but we\u2019re also, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, moving a larger proportion of our revenues to consignment. So both of those things will put pressure on inventory. But we believe those are the right things to do long term. So thanks, Stacy. We\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave, just relative to your comments in the prepared remarks about Embedded in the comms space, can you help us sort of quantify the size of that business now? And is that at all influencing the guide for the December quarter? David Pahl : Okay, yes. So let me take you back to our capital management strategy back in February. And if you look back even over the past few years, we\u2019ve been talking about how we\u2019re allocating R&D just through an end market view. So as you walk through that, no surprise that industrial and automotive, we\u2019ve been taking our allocation of R&D up there. In Personal electronics, no surprise there. It\u2019s down, but it\u2019s more selective, it\u2019s not zero. We still find good opportunities. And then comms equipment really has been a different story on Analog than it has been on Embedded. And we\u2019ve long talked about in Embedded that we\u2019ve taken our spend there up. In Analog and Embedded, we\u2019ve actually taken it down. The reason why is that when you look at 5G, there are what\u2019s new and what operators need and the OEMs that are delivering that new standard creates more complexity in the radio. And for us, that translates to more Analog contents and more opportunity. The new 5G standards really don\u2019t change things much from a digital standpoint. So we\u2019ve got good position there that\u2019s not \u2013 that isn\u2019t something that we\u2019ve needed to invest in. So really, what we are seeing is just the result as that rolls out. So we\u2019re confident in our 5G position as that market begins to grow. And we also have a great 4G business and we\u2019re still shipping some 3G stuff. So we are convinced that the majority of our growth is still going to come longer-term from industrial and automotive. But we\u2019ll \u2013 comms equipment will be a very good market for us for long periods of time. Do you have a follow-up, John? John Pitzer : Dave, I guess my question specifically is, is there another shortfall in revenue coming in Embedded Comms in the calendar fourth quarter? Because it looks like it was at least, on a year-over-year basis, about $40 million in the calendar third quarter, if your comments about Embedded growing ex comms is correct, if I\u2019m doing the math right. Is that \u2013 is there more to come in the calendar fourth quarter? Or is this now behind us? David Pahl : Yes. So last year, comms equipment was 12% of our revenues in total. And I would say that, if you have listened to the commentary, which I\u2019m sure you did, it was the one market that actually grew inside of the quarter, right? So we saw year-on-year growth in communications equipment in total even though that was not contributed by the Embedded business. So yes, those things are in our guidance going forward. I think our guidance is more influenced by the fact that we are seeing most of the markets beginning to slow versus the specifics of what\u2019s going on inside of comms equipment. So thank you, John. We\u2019ll go the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. Chris Danely with Citigroup, please go ahead. Chris Danely : Hey thanks, guys. Just a little more color maybe on the slowdown. When you talk to your customers or the distis, does it feel like things could get a little bit worse? And then maybe which \u2013 it sounds like comms looks a little bit better, which of the end markets has fallen off the most? David Pahl : Yes, let me start and see if Rafael wants to add anything. So Chris, I think that it\u2019s always best when you enter a period like this. We just kind of stick to the facts of what we can see, what we can measure. We just turned in 4% growth year-over-year. If you take the midpoint of our guidance, revenues would be flat. So that\u2019s a different number than what we\u2019ve just delivered inside of this quarter. So where it goes from there and how long it lasts are just things that we don\u2019t know. We will be in a position with what we\u2019re doing with wafer starts. That if it\u2019s a more shallow correction, we will be prepared to support it on the other side. If it\u2019s longer lived, we will be monitoring our wafer starts on a daily basis and we know how to react in those situations. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, let me add to that and I\u2019ll just frankly just emphasize what Dave say he covered it very well already. But most end markets have slowed, that\u2019s what we know. And we believe this is mostly driven by a slowdown in semiconductors, meaning we really can\u2019t speak to any macro driven event here. As we have said before, the direct effect of the tariffs for us in any of the trade issues is minimal. It\u2019s really not there. So all we can judge is by what we see right in front of us, what our customers, the signal they send us and that\u2019s what we are basing this on. In addition to that, as Dave said, the key thing here is what we do with the operating plan so that we put ourselves in a position so that if this is shallow, we can very quickly ramp back up and support growth. If it\u2019s not shallow, if it actually goes the other way, we are also in a position where we can make additional adjustments to just continue to do the right thing from a free cash flow standpoint and from an operating plan standpoint. On the investment side, as I said during our prepared remarks, we are not going to change anything on R&D. SG&A will be prudent and then on 300-millimeter, we\u2019re going to continue with the plans to continue expanding that, strengthening the competitive advantage. David Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Chris? Chris Danely : Yes. I guess, not talking about the future, but just given what\u2019s happened to you up until now. What would you attribute the cause of the slowdown? Is it just overall demand? Is it tariffs? Is it China? Is it too much inventory? Anything more specific on just the slowdown in semis? What do the customers or disties are telling you, I guess? David Pahl : Yes, Chris, I think that kind of reiterating what Rafael said and maybe add a little color is that we believe that\u2019s mostly driven by a slowdown in the semiconductor market just after several years of strong growth. It doesn\u2019t preclude that there aren\u2019t other things and other factors, the macro things that are going on. Certainly, as the quarters evolve, those things will become more obvious of what role that they\u2019ll play. But that\u2019s where \u2013 we\u2019ll just stick to what we can see and what we know. So all right, thank you, Chris. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller. Operator : Caller your line is open Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Hey guys, thanks to let me ask a question. I guess I wanted to hit it from a lead time perspective. David, doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re going to give terribly more color on it. But if it\u2019s short lead times and your lead times haven\u2019t really changed, it seems like it would be more of a demand than an inventory perspective. So any color you could give on that? And then maybe even geographically, is there any color about one market acting differently than any of the others? David Pahl : Yes, Ross. Let me just comment on a few of the things that we can see. And certainly, we watch all those indicators. And to kind of start with where I want to end is the best indicator that we get are orders from customers that we get directly as well as we\u2019ve got 60% of our revenues on consignment where we actually have demand fees that customers are telling us what they plan to build. And those clearly are the best signals that we can see. Our outlook will be built on that. And certainly, those indicators show that demand slowed across most of the end markets during the quarter. And that\u2019s why you see the guidance as it is, the sentiment that kind of as we are working through things here. So when you look at the other indicators that we see, so things like distributor inventory, it\u2019s up slightly but it\u2019s still running at about four weeks. Cancellations are up, but I would still describe them as running at low levels. Our lead times, as you mentioned, they have continued to remain stable. And it doesn\u2019t matter what period you\u2019re in, you\u2019re always going to have places where demand will be tight and we will work with customers on that. But the vast majority of products have continued to be very, very stable from a lead time standpoint. So that\u2019s kind of what we see. Regionally, I don\u2019t think when we look at our numbers, there\u2019s nothing there that we would call out, specifically. And also, just as a reminder, I know you know very well that we ship product into a particular region, it may get put into a subsystem or a system and then shipped into another region of the world. So actually, looking at our demand by regional results really doesn\u2019t give much color on what\u2019s going on from a macro standpoint. So you got a follow-on? Ross Seymore : Yes. Just quickly, you haven\u2019t mentioned the automotive market in any short-term fashion. But that\u2019s been the market that probably has the biggest laundry list of headwinds from your customers and your customers\u2019 customers. Any color of what you\u2019re seeing in aggregate or on the five sub segments within it? David Pahl : Yes. On Automotive, growth did slow there. But as you know, we\u2019ve been growing very strongly and really for five years plus. So demand slowed but it still grew double-digits, right? So we saw that growth was broad-based. It was across the sectors. But in aggregate, it did slow as well as the demand inside of industrial. And so, okay? Well, thank you, Ross. We\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead. Joe Moore : Great, thank you. I wonder if you can just \u2013 I think just take one more cut at this demand question. I mean, when you guys are guiding for Q4, is the conservatism entirely just what you\u2019re seeing in your order book? And to what degree, when you see these automotive shortfalls at your customers and, to a lesser extent, industrial shortfalls of your customer, are you budgeting for that to maybe soften from where your current level of visibility is? Or is not that the way you\u2019re looking at? Rafael Lizardi : I\u2019ll just make a quick comment and turn it over to Dave. But I wouldn\u2019t categorize or characterize that guidance as conservative. This is the best we know, based on the orders that we are getting from our customers and the best signal that we have. And that range encompasses the best of our knowledge. David Pahl : Yes, I think that\u2019s well said. Do you have a follow-on, Joe? Joe Moore : Yes, sure. I mean, do you have a sense for, when you look at your third quarter, do you think your customers built inventory? And did you see any people building ahead to get ahead of tariffs, either the 10% or the 25% tariff? Just any indications that your inventories may have built and that some element of this is softening? Is inventory declining in Q4? Just how are you thinking about those inventory levels? David Pahl : Yes. I\u2019ll point out or I\u2019ll just remind you, Joe, because I know you know, we\u2019ve got 60% of our revenues on consignment. So for that revenue, there isn\u2019t an inventory buffer at our customers that are in front of that. The demand that we\u2019re seeing is the actual \u2013 is close to the factory order builds as you\u2019re going to get. Our visibility ends there, right? So their demand downstream and downstream into their kennels, of course we have no visibility on that front. So we are fairly early in the announcement schedule and lineup. And so we will find out where that \u2013 if there is inventory out there as more companies report. So thank you very much. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of America \u2013 sorry with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Lastly checks to BMO, thank you. David Pahl : Never know. Ambrish Srivastava : Never know. I\u2019m sure Vivek is there on the line as well, sorry, Vivek. You\u2019re safe, buddy. So just, Dave, on the demand side, I just wanted to \u2013 you guys have been to several sectors. I just wanted to make sure and you\u2019re correctly calling out that you\u2019re telling us what you\u2019re seeing on the fact space. But then these metrics like cancellations or debookings or what have you, is there a rate of change that you look at and say that you can give us any perspective on how deep it\u2019s going to be or what kind of duration this would turn into? Rafael Lizardi : I\u2019ll take a shot at that. And Dave, you want to add to that. But frankly, no, we \u2013 as Dave said, we have \u2013 the visibility that we have is to the consignment inventory that\u2019s in front of us. And by the way, that is inventory that is still in our books. So we haven\u2019t recognized revenue for that. So that\u2019s one advantage of having that consignment, that inventory like that. And so that\u2019s the data point we have and we use that to forecast the next quarter\u2019s revenue. And the other data point is what Dave already mentioned, right, cancellations. They\u2019re up slightly but they continue at low levels and our lead times have remained stable. David Pahl : Yes. And I\u2019ll just say, things like distributor inventory, Ambrish, I\u2019ll point out, it\u2019s still around four weeks. That\u2019s half to a third of what many of our peers run with distributor inventory. And as we implement these next phases, that number structurally will continue to come down over time. So now that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not going to see cycles in those types of impact. And even with consignment inventory, we have as good a visibility as you can get of what our customers are going to build. But never confuse high visibility with \u2013 that, that number can\u2019t change and change quickly. So \u2013 but we know about it as soon the customers plan to do something and something different. Rafael Lizardi : And let me add a little bit to that. On that next phase of consignment that we talked about, as Dave just mentioned, that\u2019s going to take those distribution inventory weeks, from about four to maybe about three over the next year or so. That did put some headwind on our third quarter revenue of about $20 million. And it is probably going to put \u2013 it is putting another $50 million or so to our fourth quarter revenue. That is incorporated of course in our guide. Of course, that is a small part of what\u2019s going on here. As we\u2019ve said, most of our markets have slowed down and that\u2019s the main driver of the guidance that we\u2019re giving. David Pahl : Great. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes, I did, and that was helpful. What was the book-to-bill for the quarter? David Pahl : Our book-to-bill, I knew you would ask that question. It is 0.96 in the quarter. And as I always give that number, I have to \u2013 for those who don\u2019t follow us and talk about the consignment programs, we don\u2019t carry any orders for that demand. And so book-to-bill, just be careful with the number, use it in the safety of your home. So with that, we\u2019ll move onto next caller please. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. David Pahl : Hey, Vivek. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Yes. David Pahl : Are you still there? Vivek Arya : Glad I\u2019m still here. So when I look at the last two downturns that you guys went through, and I\u2019m just focusing on the core Analog and Embedded business, and I\u2019m talking about say the first half of 2013 or late 2015, they kind of lasted for two quarters, and then you saw your core Analog and Embedded business start to then start to grow year-on-year. I know you don\u2019t want to say anything about the future. But if you were to just help us contrast the customer behavior and the signals that you\u2019re seeing now versus what you saw in those downturns, is there anything that stands out, positive or negative? David Pahl : Yes, I\u2019d start that as we look at those, and we all look at industry data. As we went through those other downturns, the ups weren\u2019t very strong and therefore the downs weren\u2019t very strong, right? And I think we\u2019ve just described those as we\u2019ve moved through them. It\u2019s just operating in a world that really have low economic growth, right? So the last couple of years, certainly, we\u2019ve had much stronger upturn in the economy overall. The economic growth has been stronger over the last couple of years. So that\u2019s certainly different. I think that our business has continued to evolve. We have more industrial, more automotive business. We are continuing to invest and ensure that, that revenue is coming from diverse and long-lived places. I think that we\u2019ve continued to invest in our 300-millimeter Analog footprint and grow. So we\u2019ve got that going into the numbers. So \u2013 and if you look at the financial performance of the company over those last cycles and even this quarter, and you look at the amount of free cash flow that we\u2019re generating, we just turned in as a percentage of revenue, 37.5%. Those are good, strong numbers. And I think that those are the things that give us confidence to continue to make the investments, to make the business stronger, investing in the competitive advantages. Markets will strengthen and weaken over periods of time. But we continue to stay focused on our opportunity. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, let me comment on that. So yes, to Dave\u2019s point, we have demonstrated for a number of years now the strength of the business model. And that\u2019s through ups and now, downs. And the right thing to do, what we will continue to have done and what we will continue to do is continue to strengthen our competitive advantages so that we continue to become stronger. One of the things or one of the competitive advantages as you know is our manufacturing technologies, specifically 300-millimeter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are looking at the next tranche of capacity. So we are exploring options for our next 300-millimeter factory. And we\u2019ll likely make a decision within the next year or so. And this slowdown is not going to stop us from putting that in place. Now we\u2019ll do it smartly and the first thing that you have to do when building a factory, we can still buy a factory. But when we are building a factory, it would be to build the shell, the actual building, and then we can decide on equipment more incrementally beyond that. So to give you some things to think about on that front, our CapEx \u2013 as we do that, our CapEx will increase to about 6% of revenue. In fact, it\u2019s already there. In the last trailing 12 months, we were at 6.6%. And then that is excluding the factory shell that I just talked about. So when we went on building a factory, it will be about 6% CapEx as a percent of revenue plus the shell and that shell will be $600 million to $700 million over a couple of years. So I want you, Vivek, to consider that and think about that. So that will be \u2013 that\u2019s how we are looking at it and how we are planning the next tranche of capacity. Do you have another question? Vivek Arya : Yes, thanks for that information. The next question is on buybacks. You bought back $1.2 billion, right. You\u2019ve been very active in buybacks. So with the trailing 12 months, you still have, I believe you said $18.2 billion left. The stock is down 25% from its highs. Is it fair to assume that you can be more aggressive on buyback to take advantage of the stock price? Or in general, how do you think about when to be more aggressive with your buybacks? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. First, let me take a step back, what is the objective here? And the objective was to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. So the last 12 months, we generated $5.9 billion of free cash flow. And then we returned $6. 2 billion. So we\u2019ve returned virtually the same thing that we have generated. So that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve done for a number of years. And we will continue to do that. Can we, on the margin, do a little bit more here and there? We could and \u2013 but the big picture is that we would return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. David Pahl : Okay, thank you very much. And I think we have time for one more caller. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you. And congratulations on that Analog operating margins, that\u2019s pretty impressive. First question, your SG&A was down quite a bit sequentially. It\u2019s now below 10%. Is that going to be sort of the rate that we should consider going forward? And does that kind of already incorporate you managing the OpEx a bit more conservatively? Rafael Lizardi : What I would tell you, we think of OpEx in general, not just SG&A, but OpEx and SG&A and R&D as investments. Not everything there, but certainly, all of R&D is an investment and part of SG&A \u2013 that\u2019s part of SG&A. And that is to drive growth in revenue and free cash flow over the long-term. And that\u2019s how we view that. We suggest you also look at it that way and then it\u2019s easier to then look at it on a trailing 12-month basis. It gets some of the quarter-to-quarter transitions out of the way. That can be a little noisy. So on that basis, OpEx is up about 2% versus the same time period last quarter \u2013 or last year, I\u2019m sorry. And that is a good expectation of how that number should trail. The other thing that I would point to is that SG&A in particular in third quarter was down in part because of our CEO transition. Do you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg : Yes, Rafael, that\u2019s very helpful. My follow-up is on inventory days. So I completely get it and I understand the new consignment plan. But how high are you willing to let the inventory days go given the structural change? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics. But I\u2019ll frame it this way. One, as I said, it will likely go above the range. So right now, the range is 115 to 145. So it will likely go above 145. We think like owners. So to me, to us, that is a use of cash, right? So I feel compelled to use that cash for inventory because I think it\u2019s a good return on that investment because it\u2019s going to help us on the other side of our recovery. And as I said, it\u2019s a very low obsolescence type of inventory. But we wouldn\u2019t keep it at those levels indefinitely. If it\u2019s a long lasting slowdown, then we would take additional measures to modulate that inventory, bring it back within the range at some point in the future. David Pahl : Okay. Thank you very much, Tore. We appreciate all of you joining us tonight. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good night. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you, all again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call to review our Capital Management Strategy on February 5 at 10 AM Central Time. Similar to what we have done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy. For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll be covering three topics : first, a high-level summary of the financial results for the fourth quarter. Second, I'll provide some details of the fourth quarter by segment and end market, and I'll include some additional color in light of the market weakness we are currently experiencing. And finally, since this is the end of a calendar year, I will provide a summary of our performance by end market for 2018. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and the outlook. We'll then open the call for Q&A. Starting with the high-level summary of our fourth quarter financial results; the weakness in demand for our products that began in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. The weakness was across most markets and came in about as we expected. There were a few exceptions that I'll cover in more detail when I discuss our fourth quarter segment and end market performance. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 4% and Analog Processing declined 12% compared with the same quarter a year ago; both businesses growth decelerated. Operating margin decreased in both businesses, and similar to the third quarter, Embedded remained weaker than Analog, primarily because Analog benefited from increasing content in 5G, while the weaknesses in other markets became more pronounced in Embedded. It is not unusual for Analog and Embedded to perform differently in the short-term, but they are more consistent in the long term. Earnings per share were $1.27, including a $0.01 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $6.1 billion, up 30% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 38.4% of revenue, up from 31.2% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300mm Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In 2018, we returned $7.7 billion in cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Moving on, I'll now provide some details of the fourth quarter by segment and end market and offer some additional color on the market. From a year ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 4% due to Signal Chain and Power, partially offset by declines in High Volume. Embedded Processing revenue declined 12% from the year ago quarter due to declines in both product lines; Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined $31 million from the year ago quarter. For the year in total, Analog and Embedded grew 9% and 2%, respectively, and combined were 91% of TI's revenue. Now, given the current market environment I want to provide some additional color on the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the weakness in demand and our products that began in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. Demand came in mostly as expected, although personal electronics, and specifically smartphones, was weaker, including Chinese smartphone manufacturers. Automotive and industrial, both declined sequentially but still grew single digits from the year ago quarter. In contrast, communications equipment grew about 20% year-on-year, benefiting from 5G deployments. On a regional basis, demand in China was weaker than the other regions. End markets within China behaved directionally consistent with the rest of the world. We are seeing signs from our customers and the channel that this weakness is primarily from increased caution due to trade tensions. We assume that this weakness is a combination of lower local end demand, as well as reduced exports, but we do not have visibility into distinguish between the two. In addition, I would note that distributors, particularly in Asia, did get more conservative on their inventory positions late in the quarter. Finally, as we do at the close of each calendar year, I'll now describe our revenue by end market for 2018, which is a good indicator of our strategic progress. We break this into six categories : industrial, automotive, personal electronics which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets, and TVs, communications equipment, enterprise systems, and other, which is primarily calculators. In summary; industrial, automotive and enterprise systems each grew double digits, while communications equipment was about even and personal electronics declined low single digits in 2018. Specifically, as a percentage of revenue, industrial was 36% and automotive was 20%. Personal electronics was 23%, comms equipment and enterprise systems were 11% and 7%, respectively. Other was 3% of revenue, down low-single digits. One of our competitive advantages is diversity and longevity. For 2018, we did not have a customer who was more than 10% of our revenue. We continue our efforts to diversify our growth across products, markets and customers, strengthening this competitive advantage. We continue to focus our strategy on industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. In 2018, industrial and automotive combined made up 56% of TI's revenue, up from 54% in 2017, and up from 42% just five years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, and we see great opportunity ahead. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.41 billion, or 64.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $814 million. Operating expenses for the year were up 1% and were 20.5% of revenue, within our range of expectations. For the year, we have invested $1.56 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter, and then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Operating profit was $1.52 billion, or 40.8% of revenue. Operating profit was down 3% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 46.7%, and for Embedded Processing was 29.6%. Our focused investments under best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth overtime. Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.24 billion, or $1.27 per share, which included a $0.01 cent discrete tax benefit not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed. As a reminder, the year ago quarter included non-cash charges associated with the tax law changes. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.15 billion in the quarter, up 11% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $323 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we paid $736 million in dividends and repurchased $2.01 billion of our own stock for a total return to owners of $2.75 billion in the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.23 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt was $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.77%. Inventory days were 152, up 18 days from a year ago, and above our targeted range as mentioned on our last call. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. We have reduced our operating plan starting in the fourth quarter, but we are also working to replenish inventory of low volume devices; these actions have served us well in the past. In addition, we have made progress on our next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. We expect inventory will continue to run above our targeted range for several more quarters. Now, let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2018, cash flow from operations was $7.19 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.13 billion, or 7.2% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2018 was $6.06 billion, or 38.4% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all our free cash flow to owners. Total cash returned to owners in 2018 was $7.66 billion. These combined returns of dividends and share repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all free cash flow to our owners. In 2018, we paid $2.56 billion in dividends, or about 42% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.9% in 2018, and has been reduced by 45% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter; we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.21, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. For 2019 our annual operating tax rate remains unchanged from our prior expectation of 16%. As usual, details of our expectations for taxes can be found on our IR website under Financial Summary Data. In closing, we believe that after 10 quarters of year-on-year growth, the weakness we are seeing is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. In addition, the macro environment, including uncertainty caused by trade tensions, could impact the depth and duration of this cycle. Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long-term, while remaining diligent in the short-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach, and diverse and long-lived positions [ph]. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products; Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets; industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as any of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : We will take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : I'm curious, how are you managing your utilization in this downturn that you are seeing? I know Rafael, you mentioned that you have long-lived parts but how are you managing utilization? And are you making any distinction by the end-market that the specific part is going into? And as part of that, should we continue to assume the same 75% or so incremental gross margin fall-through? Rafael Lizardi : So let me answer the last one first, yes. And now let me go back to your question. So as I -- there is a bit of an echo on the call, but as I -- as we talked a lot on the call 90 days ago, we have reduced our wafer starts to align our operating plan better with our revenue expectations; we did that in fourth quarter, and we are doing that again in the first quarter. That does drive lower factory loadings, and that does have a P&L effect but the way we're thinking about it is as an owner, is from a cash standpoint. So inventory is a use of cash, as we drive down inventory that actually helps cash. And more importantly, it sets us up to support our revenue expectations for the coming year. As to revenue expectations, those revenue expectations change overtime, then we'll adjust the factory loadings and utilization in order to manage that appropriately. Dave Pahl : And I'll just add to the second part of your question; we've got tens of thousands of products across 100,000 customers, so you can imagine the complexity of that planning. The strongest signal that we get is the orders from customers, as well as the demand signals that we get through our consignment programs. So as we go through and planned wafer starts, that is -- that's what we pay close attention to. And obviously in a time like this, we'll be very diligent in watching that, and then proactively moving when we need to. So with that, do you have a follow-up Vivek? Vivek Arya : So the second part is, I know you mentioned that it's hard to predict when we come out of this downturn. But are there any other signs that you look at, even if there are qualitative, that can give us some indication whether this is a one or two or three quarter issue? I understand it's very trade dependent but have you seen cancellations that are any different or similar to prior downturns? Any other color that you could help -- that you could give us to help us try and at least predict somewhat when we come out of this would be very useful. Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes Vivek, so maybe just a couple of things. I think when we look at different things that we can look at like cancellations, they were up in the quarter, but just up a little. Lead times, overall, they continue to be stable. We can always find pockets where we're working aggressively with customers to close but by and far, they tend to be very stable. So we'll look at all of those signals. I think on the broader view, I've been in the industry for over 30 years now, and we looked at data over that period of time, and I've been through 9 up cycles, and obviously, we're entering into the ninth down cycle. And if you stare at the data, and I've seen in your reports, Vivek, that you've done some analysis on that too, there is no typical or average to those numbers but if you had to pick a number it's probably around the 12 months that a cycle could last. And things like that trade tensions could lengthen that, but it doesn't mean it has to be that long; as you know, it could be longer or shorter than that. So again, the best signal that we get is those orders from customers. Rafael, you want to add to that? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, just to add to that, we are proactively setting the operating plan so that we can manage whatever comes at us. So it's at a level that if we can run sideways for a while, we are prepared to support our potential snapback. Or if it's deeper and longer, then we have to make further adjustments but we are in a good position to make those adjustments and protect the cash flow and have the company in a position going forward. Operator : We'll move to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Just Rafael, going back to kind of utilization and inventory; I know you said in your prepared comments, you'll be above sort of your inventory targets for next several quarters. I'm just kind of curious relative to how you see the world today and what action you've already taken on utilization? Do you think 152 days will represent kind of the peak in inventory days or would you expect it to migrate to higher before migrating lower? And I guess as you answer the question, if you could just remind us with the consignment plan, kind of -- what are the new targets for inventory longer term? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, so that's a good question, let me just give you a few things to think about on that. First, as I said before, at the end of the day our objective here is to maximize long-term growth of free cash flow, so that's how we think about all these norms [ph]. Loadings and inventory is one of them, CapEx is another one, that all we're doing is trying to maximize that long-term growth. With inventory, as we say, we see value in owning that inventory, that's part of the reason why we are building that low volume, those low-volume buffer that we talked about is also the reason why we are increasing the consignment inventory. And that does push -- put upward pressure on inventory. At the same time, we -- overall we have lowered the operating plan, so that is to control the cash that's used for inventory, more or so than any particular inventory days target. Now to get to the heart of your specific question, it depends, right. So if this thing gets weaker, then inventory days could theoretically go up higher than 152. If it stays above stable, then over one, two or three quarters, we'll get back to the insider range. John Pitzer : Then Dave, as a follow-up, you talked about sort of -- there has been times where discrepancy in growth between Analog and Embedded; I'm wondering if you could just help us understand kind of from an end market perspective, where the discrepancy is sort of the largest? For example; I know in the comm space, there is a really good content story on the Analog side that might not be there on the Embedded side. So when you look at the difference of growth rates, is there any sort of end market color you can give us? Dave Pahl : Yes, and certainly, both of those segments do have different end market exposure. We talked about the benefits that Analog is staying in comms equipment. You know, most of our PE revenues in Analog is well, so that's the difference, we do have some inside of Embedded. But -- and John, if you look at year-over-year growth rates for as long as we've had the segments out there, you'll notice in times that they are actually moving in opposite directions but overtime, if you look at those numbers, they really do perform more similar. And then, also if you look at just industry data for the Analog market and compare that to the Embedded market, those behave differently. So I think that that's just kind of the facts of how those two businesses behave. Thank you, we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : We'll move next to Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur : What was the book-to-bill in the December quarter? And near-term, kind of looking at bookings and the rolling forecast on your direct and consignment base customers, have you guys seen any signs of stabilization or do the near-term trends still suggests kind of continued weakness along the same sort of the slope? Dave Pahl : Yes. So our book-to-bill, and I always make this comment whenever it's asked, we've got now 65% of our revenues on some type of a consignment program, so you're seeing that number begin to move up as we implement further stages of our consignment programs with distributors; so book-to-bill is somewhat you just have to be cautious with the number. But this past quarter it was 0.98, it was 0.98 a year ago and 0.96 in the last quarter; so that's just what the facts are. I think if you look at things like order linearity, orders decreased each month of the quarter. To some degree, that's not completely unusual that in a fourth quarter that you'd see weakness as you got into the third month. But I'd just say that those orders and the demand feeds that we get from our customers has really driven us to give you the guidance that we have; so that's really where we are Harlan. You have a follow-on? Harlan Sur : Yes. Given the growth this year, you guys drove another $1 billion of Analog revenues to your 300-millimeter fabs, you've got probably about $3 billion left to go. So, if I assume kind of high-single digits type of normalized revenue growth for Analog, your 300-millimeter fabs are going to be full in about 1.5 years. So it would seem that that the team would be having to make a decision soon about your new fab expansion initiatives. So you guys have any updates there? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, let me give you my view, and then Dave may go ahead and chime in. But capacity planning for new 300-millimeter tranche of capacity, that's something we've got to take very seriously, and something that has a very long-term horizon. So this is something that is not changed by small fluctuations in short-term expectations, so we are continuing the planning process on that and right now we have options to consider and we'll continue thinking of that. As we have said, I think 90 days ago, whenever we do decide to go that route, if we do build our factory, that'd probably be a $600 million to $700 million cost on the shell, the actual building, and that will probably spend over a couple of years. So that's not the only option we have for -- to expand capacity, we can always buy an existing factory and that's another option that we're considering. And also I would say, the -- if we do build a factory, there are multiple locations that we're considering. Dave Pahl : And I'd just add Harlan; that last year we had about $4.8 billion of our Analog revenue on 300-millimeter footprint, that was up from about $4 billion, that's real close to what the Analog segment actually grew. So again, we plan to talk about as Analog would grow, that it would be 300-millimeter that would support the growth. And roughly, that's what we've seen again this quarter. Operator : We'll take Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely : Dave, first of all, congratulations on surviving 8 downturns. Can you guys talk about the ability to manage CapEx and OpEx this year if this sluggish time period continues? Could you work OpEx down on a year-over-year basis? And then, I think you said CapEx was 7.2% of sales or something like that; what should we be thinking about CapEx as a percent of sales this year? Dave Pahl : Let me give you some background there. First, as I mentioned earlier on the call, all the knobs that we have at the end of the day are to optimize and maximize long-term growth of free cash flow per share; so that's the main objective, as you know very well from knowing us for many years and our capital management strategy. So CapEx is one of those knobs, and for CapEx specifically, what is the objective, it's to invest and support in new technology development, it's revenue growth and to expand our low-cost manufacturing advantage. So in 2018, we spent $1.1 billion for CapEx and as you pointed out, that was 7.2% of revenue. At the same thing, we generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow, that was 30% growth on free cash flow from the previous years. So despite that CapEx, we increased free cash flow, that 30%. Now that CapEx is positioning us to grow the top line and free cash flow for a long time to come. Now given, as you pointed out and as our midpoint and our range implies, decelerating market, then we can do things differently on CapEx. Going forward, I expect -- if conditions continue, a slowdown in CapEx, probably not in the first quarter, maybe not even in the second quarter, but over 2019. We'll just keep that in mind -- keep in mind that is all dependent on expectations of growth beyond that for years, not just 2019 or even 2020. So we'll adjust those -- we'll adjust the CapEx plan as those expectations change. Rafael Lizardi : And I'd just add; I think when you look at 2019, that we'd expect CapEx to run into the future even beyond 2019, closer to 6% of revenue. And that's higher than what it's been in the past just because of the availability of -- use the 300-millimeter equipment on the market, so that's where our expectations there are. You have a follow-on, Chris? Chris Danely : Yes. Can you guys just talk about how the slowdown is impacting your two biggest end markets, industrial and automotive? Dave Pahl : Yes, I think that when we look at them, they both slowed in the quarter. We actually saw industrial; it was really broad-based growth on -- from a year-on-year basis, it was double digits but inside of the quarter, it actually grew upper single digits. And then automotive again, it had slowed, but it grew double digits in total for the year but for the quarter, for year-on-year quarter it grew in low-single digits. So again, both of those markets are growing but certainly not at the rates that we have seen over the past few years. Okay, thank you, Chris. And we'll go to our next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. That will be from Timothy [ph] from UBS. Unidentified Analyst : Dave, can you give us an idea of OpEx for March? I know it's typically up like 5% seasonally, but it's also a little more fixed now than in the past. So is it going to be up a smidge [ph], both year-over-year and on a quarterly basis? Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, so I'll go ahead and take that. First, step back real quick, OpEx is just another knob that we have to optimize long-term growth of free cash flow per share, right; at the end of the day, that is the long-term objective. And in the case of OpEx, it's an opportunity to invest in R&D, so to put more products for industrial and automotive is an opportunity to invest in demand creation on the SG&A side and other things, other initiatives that's going to strengthen our competitive advantages. If you look at 2018, that OpEx came in at about 1% growth versus the previous year and 20.5% of revenue. On a go-forward basis for 2019, for dollars of OpEx, I would expect somewhere in the neighborhood, maybe up a couple of percentage points for pay and benefit increases, something along those lines. But generally speaking, at about that same level, all OpEx. Now you asked specifically about the quarter, we give you a range for revenue, a range for EPS; we don't get in the lines between, but I will tell you we're not expecting anything unusual. You can look at the fall-through -- expected fall-through on revenue to GPM [ph] and do your own models, and you should get to a reasonable assumption or conclusion for those lines in between. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on? Unidentified Analyst : I do, actually. So Rafael, the Repo [ph] was the biggest in -- as a percent of free cash flow, I'm thinking about 3 years. I know that you don't think of it that way on kind of a quarterly basis but it's historically been a little more mechanical than opportunistic. So should we kind of read into that that you were a little more opportunistic because of the stock pullback? Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, thanks for the question. So, again, let me step back and remind everybody, what's our intent when it comes to repurchases; and our intent is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company and that objective has not changed. We do that through a combination of dividends and buybacks, and we will be -- we have been and will be opportunistic with repurchases as it makes sense. So for example, in 2018, as I mentioned earlier, our free cash flow was $6.1 billion, that was an increase of 30% from the previous year. And we'd return $7.7 billion throughout the year through a combination of dividends and buybacks. And that year-on-year free cash flow growth was the biggest driver of that increase in returns, as a $6.1 billion increase from $4.7 billion in the previous year. Dave Pahl : Okay, great. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : That will be from Chris [ph] with Raymond James. Unidentified Analyst : First question, I wondered if you can talk about geographic differences. And you mentioned China in your opening remarks, and I think that's obvious right now. Maybe what did you see there and contrast that with what you saw in the U.S. and Europe; was that weak also, just perhaps not as weak as China business? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, that's exactly right, Chris. So when we looked at China, it was weaker than the other regions. And then when you drop down into the end markets within China, I just described it as really performing very similarly, directionally, meaning that comms equipment was up as it was in other areas, we saw the markets of auto and industrial, as well as enterprise get weaker from that standpoint; so we did see that difference this quarter. You have a follow-on? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. And I guess, you would also mentioned in your remarks the impact of the trade issues and tariffs. And obviously, it's very hard to disassociate that from what's going on in the end markets. But with that, have you also seen -- I guess we've heard this from some others that perhaps there was some activity of either pulling forward orders to get ahead of tariffs, or pushing out things because of the tariffs; and obviously, the deadlines have changed and we've got another deadline coming up. I guess the question is what effect it may have had on order patterns as we went through the quarter? Dave Pahl : Yes, I think it's hard for us to actually distinguish that specifically. But the one thing that we did see was, distributors did get more cautious on their inventory late in the quarter. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks; I think that kind of coupled with the signs of weakness that we saw in China, that's really led us to the belief that that's part of the caution that they are seeing from a trade tension standpoint. So -- okay, thank you, Chris and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. That will be from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Unidentified Analyst : This is Jerry [ph] on behalf of Ross. I just have a quick question on -- you mentioned consignment transition; is there -- could you quantify an impact to the 1Q '19 guide and 2019 as a whole [ph]? Dave Pahl : Yes, I'd say that we saw probably about $50 million impact in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter -- Rafael, you can remind me, it's about $20 million or $30 million\u2026 Rafael Lizardi : Yes, in the third quarter. Dave Pahl : In the third quarter of 2018. We'd expect as we go through next year that that impacted to be about in that range. And by the end of the year, we should have that next phase fully deployed. You have a follow-on? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, there has been some questions about end markets; I just want to ask in a different way. Could you just talk about quarter-on-quarter what the end market did, specifically focusing on the fourth quarter? Dave Pahl : Certainly. So industrial declined upper single digits, I'd just say those declines were broad-based. Automotive declined upper single digits with all sectors decreasing, personal electronics declined low double digits, comms equipment grew single digits, and enterprise systems declined. So with that, I think we have time for one more caller. Operator : And that will be from Amit [ph] with RBC Capital Markets. Unidentified Analyst : I guess two questions from me as well. I mean, first off, when I look at the March quarter guide and the implication is revenues will decline from 1% in December year-over-year to about 8% in March. What is driving that acceleration in revenue declines? Is there a couple of end markets you would specifically call out that's driving it where perhaps the challenge was adjusting [ph] aggressively or is it more or less broad-based? Dave Pahl : Amit, when we give our guidance we don't do it by end markets unless there is something specific that is going on that kind of would be discontinuous with how things are operating. So we'll finish up the quarter and let that -- it will provide the details by end markets then. But clearly, the weakness that we saw in the third quarter continued into the fourth. Obviously, that -- we're continuing to expect that to continue into first. Rafael Lizardi : And just to add to that, as we've said in prepared remarks and during the call; we think this weakness is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. We've grown for third quarter in a row [ph], and that's the sort of thing that happens in the semiconductor industry. And in addition to that, the macro environment, including the trade tensions could also be having an impact and could affect that and the duration of [indiscernible]. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-on, Amit? Unidentified Analyst : I do. In the past, best you have talked about your ability to keep picking up 30, 40, 50 -- 30 to 40 basis points a share across your end markets. As you look at '19 where revenue or broader industry trends are somewhat more challenging, is it easier for larger analog company to pick up more market share or is it more difficult for you guys? How would you kind of stack that up? Dave Pahl : I think when you look at the quality of the opportunity in the Analog and Embedded space, if market share just doesn't move quickly across any of our peers in these marketplaces; and I think that just really speaks to the quality of that opportunity. So we continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are our manufacturing and technology we talked about earlier, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels which includes our sales force and the size of it but also our presence at TI.com, and then diversity and longevity. So we're not dependent on any particular customer or product or technology to drive that revenue. So we're working and investing to make those stronger, it's just hard to pick up market share; I can tell you that everyone here at TI will be focused on that even as we go through the downturn, and probably have even more diligence and intensity around that overall. But again, if you could make that number higher, we absolutely would, but it is a hard thing to move. So with that, let me turn it over to Rafael to add some final comments. Rafael Lizardi : All right. So let me finish with a few comments on some key items for you to remember. First, during this period of weaker demand, we will stay focused on what will make us stronger long-term and diligent in the short-term. Second, we will remain focused on the Analog and Embedded, the best products, and Industrial and Automotive, the best markets. Third, we will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning all free cash flow to the owners of the company. Dave Pahl : Okay, thank you for joining us. Again, please plan to join us for our Capital Management call on February 5 at 10 AM Central Time. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator : That does conclude our conference call for today, everyone. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web as well. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I will be covering the following topics. First, a high-level summary of the financial results for the first quarter. Second, I will provide some details of the first quarter by segment and end-market. And third, I will include some additional color in light of the market weakness we are currently experiencing. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results, a brief comment on the status of our next 300 millimeter fab, and then the outlook. Then, we will open the call for Q&A. Now starting with the high-level summary of our first quarter financial results. The weakness in demand that began in the second half of 2018 continued into the first quarter. The weakness was across all markets with the exception of communications equipment. In our core businesses, analog revenue declined 2% and embedded processing revenue declined 14% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Both businesses\u2019 year-on-year growth decelerated as we expected at this point in the cycle. Similar to the fourth quarter, embedded remained weaker than analog, primarily because it didn't benefit from increasing content in 5G. Operating margin decreased in both businesses. Reduced factory loadings affected both businesses, but the impact was greater in analog since more of its supply comes from internal manufacturing. Overall revenue in the first quarter decreased 5% from a year ago and earnings per share were $1.26, including a $0.04 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. With that backdrop, I will now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow to owners. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 month period was $6 billion, up 22% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 38.4% of revenue, up from 32.1% from a year ago. We continued to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all our free cash flow to owners. Moving on, I will now provide some details of the first quarter by segment and end-market and then offer some additional color on the market. From a year-ago quarter, analog revenue declined 2% due to high volume and power, partially offset by growth in signal chains. I will note that the strength in communications equipment minimized analog's decline. Embedded processing revenue declined by 14% from a year ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, processors, and connected microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined 6% from a year ago. Now given the current weaker market environment, I wanted to provide some additional color on the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the weakness in demand for our products that began in the second half of 2018 continued into the first quarter. Demand came in mostly as expected, although communications equipment was stronger than expected due to shipments of products that support 5G. Next, I will provide some insight into this quarter's performance by end-market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive declined mid-single digits due to broad-based weakness. We continue to focus our investments across 13 sectors in industrial and five sectors in automotive. Despite this near-term weakness, we continue to believe these investments will deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth over the long-term. Personal electronics declined low double digits due to broad-based weakness, including mobile phones and PCs. In contrast, communications equipment grew about 30% year-on-year, and as we mentioned earlier, benefiting both from 5G shipments as well as an easy compare due to weakness in the year ago period. History would suggest that we should expect this market to be choppy in the future. And then lastly, enterprise systems declined. Looking at these end-markets on a regional basis, generally all the regions performed consistently, excluding the positive effects of communications equipment. So in summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and they also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.26 billion or 62.9% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 170 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $803 million, down about 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.7% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.56 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our topline over the long term. Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of this year, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Operating profit was $1.38 billion or 38.4% of revenue. Operating profit was down 11% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 43.2%, down from 45.4% a year ago and for embedded processing was 31.3%, down from 35.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time. Net income in the first quarter was $1.22 billion, or $1.26 per share, which included a $0.04 discrete tax benefit not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $251 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.99 billion. In the first quarter, we paid $724 million in dividends and repurchased $1.15 billion of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.88 billion. In total, we have returned $8.05 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 45% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.09 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt is $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.91%. Inventory days were 144, up eight days from a year ago and down eight days sequentially. We are pleased with the progress we have made replenishing inventory of low volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. Work in both of these areas will continue in the second quarter. We believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory and will manage it with our long-term objectives in mind. Next, as we mentioned earlier, we want to update you on our next 300 millimeter wafer fab. As you may have seen, we have chosen Richardson, Texas, as the site for our next wafer fab. The new building will be on our existing site in Richardson. We have not announced a specific construction timetable yet, but as we indicated during the February Capital Management call, we would expect to get started in the next few years. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.46 billion to $3.74 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.12 to $1.32, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% in 2019. In closing, as we said last quarter, we believe that after 10 quarters of year-on-year growth, the weakness we are seeing is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. We have just completed our second quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. If you look at history, cycles are always different, but typically the industry would have four to five quarters of year-on-year declines before year-on-year growth resumes. We are not trying to forecast the cycle, but simply offer some historical perspective. Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long term, while remaining diligent in the short term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, analog and embedded processing and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will go first to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I am kind of thinking how to interpret your Q2 outlook. One interpretation is that you are not really seeing much recovery off of Q1, right, which is kind of surprising when we hear of China PMI improving and all the optimism about some signs of recovery. The other interpretation is that maybe Q1 you saw the extra benefit from comm equipment. So if I exclude that, then you are seeing some modest pickup going into Q2. So I am just curious, how are you thinking about your Q2 outlook versus seasonally, which is supposed to be up 7%, 8% sequentially? Dave Pahl : Yes. Vivek, I would say, certainly, I can confirm the first part of the question that in first quarter, we did get a benefit from comms equipment. That's just in the numbers. I think when we look at our second quarter outlook and we put that together, again we base that on the orders that we get from customers as well as the demand feeds that we get through our consignment programs. And just as a reminder, about two-thirds of our revenue comes through those consignment programs. And for OEMs, we will typically get six months of visibility and there is no inventory that sits in front of us in that manufacturing line. So, it really is one of the best signals that we can get. And I also would caution that that doesn't mean that that signal can't change very quickly. So, that's how we are basing the guidance for the second quarter, and I will leave further interpretation to you. Do you have follow-up? Vivek Arya : Yes. Thanks Dave. So maybe if I ask the question in a different way. Have you seen any pickup in orders over the last few weeks versus let's say the first few weeks of the year? Dave Pahl : Well, I would say that orders behaved normally in the quarter. And again, two-thirds of our revenue is coming through on consignment. So, we will get an order when that product is due to ship and that happens instantaneously. So, orders are probably less of the strongest signal that we will get versus those demand signals that we get from orders. So, thank you, Vivek. And we will go to next caller please. Operator : We will go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes. Thanks guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Rafael, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the utilization actions you are taking? How much of a hit were they to the calendar first quarter gross margins? And I guess more importantly, I know it takes time for utilization actions to go through the P&L, but have the utilization rates now bottomed and how do you think about utilization relative to Q2 gross margins and going throughout the remainder of the year? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me try to frame that for you a little bit. Over the last couple of quarters, we have talked about how we are going to decrease our wafer starts to adjust to the expectations of revenue, while at the same time we are going to increase the portion or a dedicate portion of those wafers to building our low-volume industrial consignment or industrial buffer parts, and also the transition to consignment. So, we did those things and our operating plan did reduce, and we did take a hit to gross margins in that process, and that's what you are seeing in our P&L. Now what I would sort of take you back to is look at it from a free cash flow standpoint, because ultimately that's what matters, right. What you are seeing from a utilization charges standpoint is a non-cash expense. At the end of the day, what we are focused on is allocating capital and allocating cash, right. So, by decreasing those wafer starts, what we did was dedicating less cash to that. So in fact, leaving out more cash for the owners of the company, but generating enough inventory or the right amount of inventory to be prepared for the revenue that we want to meet in the future, and also to build those buffer inventory stocks so that we are prepared for future quarters and have the ability to meet customer expectations and customer satisfaction, which ultimately is what we are trying to do with that inventory so that it helps us position ourselves to meet those customer demands and help with our goal of continuing to grow the topline for a long time to come. Dave Pahl : Yes. Just a number on that, I think if you look at our first quarter, trailing 12-month free cash flow is at 38.4%. That was the same that we had last quarter, so it didn't change much. Do you have a follow-on, John? John Pitzer : Yes. Dave, just going back to the revenue guidance for the calendar second quarter, if you look at how that business has historically performed, I think I need to go back to 2001 to see a calendar second quarter that was down sequentially, and that was sort of in the wake of the tech bubble. Again, I am just trying to get a sense of what you are seeing in the bottoms up business to potentially have a scenario when they are of down sequential revenue? And I guess you mentioned in your prepared comments that the comms business can be lumpy historically. Is embedded in the Q2 guidance still good lumpiness or would you expect that lumpiness in the comms sector? Dave Pahl : Yes. So I would say, first, if you look over, and you know this very well, John, if you look over 10, 15, 25 years of the comms equipment market, that business is lumpy. It's lumpy because of the way that operators put out tenders and place the orders and the OEMs, our customers, have to build to those. So history just says that you should be mindful of that and that doesn't make it a bad business. It's just an attribute of it. And so, I think in the second quarter, I would remind you that we just completed the second quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. It's not likely that cycles, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, can last four or five quarters. Sometimes, they can be shorter and sometimes they can be longer than that, but we are two quarters into that. And per our practice, if there was something significant or unusual going on in our guidance, either by end-markets or a particular customer, we would make those things clear to help you understand it. So, okay. Thank you, John. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : We will go next to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Guys, thanks for taking my questions. Again, I want to push on the comm point a little bit. I know analog and embedded have diverged, partially because of this. If it wasn't for the upside on comm. and analog, do you think it would be seeing similar year-over-year trends without the strength in comm as well as in the embedded? Dave Pahl : Yes. Stacy, they would be much closer. I think there are still some differences, but directionally all the end-markets are the same and they would maybe much closer from year-over-year decline standpoint. Do you have a follow-on? Stacy Rasgon : I do. Again, I want to follow-up still on comm. So we are seeing very strong ups I mean, I guess the first part of it is sort of I think you mentioned this that the upside versus guidance in the quarter that was all comm. So the rest of the business came in as expected. And I guess just secondly on how concerned are you, what's the possibility that the current strength we would see in comm is not actually matched and then ultimately worried about like order pull-forwards and most of the things from some of the larger customers? Like what are you seeing along those lines around the sustainability of the upside that we are seeing in comm now I guess over the medium to long term? Dave Pahl : Yes. So I would say that the upside that we saw was almost all from comms. I think that the rest of the markets and businesses, if you looked at it from that way, performed about as we expected. And the comments on what the future of that looks like, I would just go back to the statements that we made before and just staring at history of that market it tends to be choppy. So would we expect it to be choppy in the future? We would. That's not a comment on second quarter or third or fourth. It's just the comment of looking at history that that market just tends to be choppy. So okay. Thank you Stacy. We will go to the next caller, please. Operator : We will go next to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Mark Lipacis : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first question is, will your factory loadings go up sequentially in this quarter versus last quarter? Or are they going to be going down? I am try to understand if you believe inventories are going to be a source or use of cash this quarter? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Last quarter we characterized that, because it was more relevant at the time given the inflection point on our revenue. Now that the midpoint of our revenue is about the same as the first quarter, I think it's time to just not focus on that and focus on the other things that we think are more important longer term, which is our ability to continue to grow the topline as we focus on analog and embedded industrial automotive. And with that as we focus on growing free cash flow for the long-term, as Dave mentioned earlier and we mentioned during the call, despite the drop in gross margin and the drop in utilization, our free cash flow on the trailing 12-months was essentially unchanged from 90 days ago. And as a percent of revenue, it was 38.4%, right. Dave Pahl : And I think that just speaks to the quality of the business model that topline can change quite a bit, but if you look at that trailing 12-months free cash flow, it just tends to be much more stable. And that just speaks to the quality of the model. Mark, do have a follow on? Mark Lipacis : Yes. Thank you. Dave, in your script you said, I may have misunderstood this, but you said that regionally the business trends were consistent except for communications equipment. I don't think I really quite understand that. I am hoping you can just spell that statement out for me? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes. So that you can think of the largest manufacturers of communications equipment, we try not to go by customer of who those are. But there are only a couple of regions in which they exist. And so you can imagine that you can connect those two pieces of information together. So hopefully that helps. Thank you Mark. We will go to the next caller, please. Operator : We will go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. I had a follow-up on the comm segment. Dave, you talked about the business being up 30% year-over-year. What was embedded in your original guide for the first quarter? Dave Pahl : Well again, I think that overall our revenue came within the range of our expected guidance. It was in the upper half primarily because of the strength that we saw in comms equipment. Toshiya Hari : Okay. Got it. And then as a quick follow-up for Rafael. I wanted to get an update on your thoughts on capital return. Your stock is back up to now quite your 52-week high, but pretty close. How should we think about buybacks versus dividends versus other uses of cash going forward? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. And I am happy to address that, Toshiya. First let me take everybody back to our capital management strategy, the objective that we talk about. And when it comes to cash return, our objective there is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company via buybacks and dividends. And we think that we recognize that sometimes you strategically build cash, sometimes you strategically drain cash, right. So then you can actually return more than 100% of free cash flow, as frankly we have done for the last few years. But on the two pieces, so dividends and buybacks. On dividends, the goal is to provide a sustainable and growing dividend and we target to be somewhere between 40% to 60% of free cash flow. At the moment, on the trailing 12-month basis, we are at 45%. And then on the repurchases is the creative capture of future free cash flow for the long-term owners. But that essentially means, so let me dive a little deeper on repurchases because I think that's where your question is going. We use reasonable assumptions, not aggressive, not conservative, but reasonable assumptions of our expected growth of free cash flow per share for the company for a long time to come and then based on that, we develop our assessment on valuation of intrinsic value of the company. And then we compare that to their market price and depending on the divergence of those, we buy back. So as long as this is below their intrinsic and higher than market price, we will be buying back shares and how much it depends on their divergence, right. So you can see our history of the last year-and-a-half or so. I mean we have been returning significantly more than 100% of free cash flow as we do that assessment. But as long as the intrinsic value is higher than the market price, we will buy back shares in the open market. With that, do you have a follow-up? Dave Pahl : No, that was his follow-up. We will go to the next caller, please. Operator : We will go next to Chris Danley with Citigroup. Dave Pahl : I think he got muted. Operator : Mr. Danley, your line is open. Chris Danley : Yes. Hi guys. I heard that the operator came on. Anyway, my question is on trends over in China. Can you just comment on how the order trends have gone over there over the last three months? Have you seen any stabilization? And then any words you can give us on distribution inventory as well? Dave Pahl : Yes. Chris, I would say that as we said in the prepared remarks that really all the regions performed similarly with the exception of comms equipment that we talked about. All of our markets were pretty consistent this quarter. Distributor inventories were up a little more than a day sequentially to just a little over four-and-a-half weeks. Do you have a follow-on, Chris? Chris Danley : Yes I do. So a bit of a longer-term question. I will break with [indiscernible] them on the call. If we look at your \"other revenue\", it's like a 8% of sales now and the operating margin has been sort of steadily trending down over the last few years and I think in the most recent quarter was 15%. So it was about 25% below the corporate average. A, why is that operating margin so low? What's going on there? And then B, why not just start shutting down or ending life of those products? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. A couple of things on that. Recently, in this last quarter, we did have a decrease inside of that business within our DLP business but a lot of that was due to this consignment transition that we have talked about. So that's part of what drove the short-term and also maybe some of what the margin issue that you are attributing to. I would also remind you that some of the acquisition charges for example, restructuring charges, that's all in that other piece. Remember, especially on the acquisition charge, that's non-cash. So elsewhere that represents cash that went out the door about eight years ago. So you adjust for that. That maybe gives you a better picture. And lastly, we do have the customized piece there, couple of hundred million still left per year there and over the next two, three, four years that will trend to zero. The rest of the business should be fairly steady and inside of other. Dave Pahl : Yes. And the other comment that I would make, Chris, you can see the seasonality of calculator not only in the revenues but you can see it in the operating margin. So almost all of those revenues come for back to school. So we will see that at the end of the second quarter and the beginning of third. But obviously, the expenses for that business carry out throughout the whole year. So always you will see because that revenue comes in, in that short period of time, the operating margins in those two quarters look much nicer. And the last comment I will make and we kind of joke about, we should have come up with a more creative name for other, like other good stuff or something like that. So those businesses generate lots of cash for us. And they don't take a lot of resources to maintain them. So that's why they remain in the family. So with that, I think we have got time for one more caller. Operator : We will go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Hi. I just had a question on the genesis that some of the inventory related weakness you are seeing. We saw last year some of the tightness of things that TI doesn't sell, like MLCC capacitors and things like that where the lead times got really inflated and clearly that's corrected now. I guess as you look back on that, do you think that that triggered inventory of TI components to get built? And where do you think we are in sort of that cycle playing its way through in terms of shortages of other components that TI can't control? Dave Pahl : Yes. I think Joe that as you are describing it, that's kind of what drives semiconductor cycles, right. I think that if you think of a customer wherever they are in the world and they start to get notified from their suppliers and our peers that their lead times are going out, even though ours aren't going out, they may decide to proactively take their inventory position from six weeks to nine weeks over a 90-day period. And that will drive strength in the business overall and 90-days later they decide to go from nine weeks to 12 weeks of inventory, because things look like they are getting even tighter. And then, once they get comfortable, it moves back in the other way. So as you watch that play out, we had 10 quarters of very strong growth. Most of that was double digit. I think most people when they looked at that would describe that as above trend and what follows 10 quarters of running above trend is a few quarters that will run below. So you have follow-on, Joe? Joe Moore : Yes. And I guess you may have touched on this and I missed it. But any change in your own lead times over the last three months? Dave Pahl : Generally our lead times have remained stable. Even through the period of very strong demand, our lead times had remained stable. I think that you can always find pockets just as you can today where we will work with customers very aggressively to close. And I think another important metric that we track, Joe, is on time delivery and those have remained very, very high. Other customer service metrics remained very high. So meaning that, if someone does come and order products at lead time, are we shipping them to the commitments that we have got and those remained high through that whole cycle. And some of the things that we are doing like building inventory of low volume parts during this peak period of weaker demand, we are doing that to ensure that we can continue to deliver product consistently to customers. That's really what's driving that. That and the visibility that we get through programs like consignment, kind of a combination of those things, we are actually doing other things around inventory positions and order entry and we have summarized that as really the belief that their strategic value in owning and controlling that inventory and keeping it on our balance sheet. So with that, I will turn it over to Rafael to wrap things up for us. Rafael Lizardi : All right. Thanks Dave. Let me finish with a few comments on key items for you to remember. First, as we mentioned last quarter, we will stay focused on what will make us stronger long term and diligent in the short term. Second, we will remain focused on analog and embedded, the best products and industrial and automotive, the best markets. And third, we will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company. A - Dave Pahl : Thank you and good night. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. For today\u2019s call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I\u2019ll be covering the following topics : First, a high-level summary of the financial results for the second quarter and second, some details by segment and end market. Rafael will then review : Profitability, capital management results, and then the outlook, after that we will open the call for Q&A. Starting with the high-level summary of our second quarter financial results. The quarter progressed about as we expected, with revenue decreasing 9% from a year ago due to broad-based weakness. In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 6% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 16% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Both businesses\u2019 year-on-year growth decelerated. Earnings per share were $1.36, including a $0.07 benefit for items not in our original guidance. The benefit includes $0.04 due to the previously announced sale of our Greenock, Scotland fab, with the balance primarily due to discrete tax benefits. With that backdrop, I\u2019ll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. We remain committed to returning all our free cash flow to owners. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 3% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 38.9% of revenue, up from 36.6% a year ago. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $8 billion of cash to our owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners. Moving on, I\u2019ll now provide some details on the second quarter by segment and end market. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue declined 6% due to declines in High Volume, Power and Signal Chain. Embedded Processing revenue declined by 16% from the year-ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. Next, I\u2019ll provide some insight into this quarter\u2019s performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive together declined upper-single digits due to broad-based weakness. Personal electronics declined low-double digits also due to broad-based weakness. In communications equipment, revenue declined sequentially, but was about even from a year ago versus a weak compare. And lastly, enterprise systems declined. In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.36 billion, or 64.3% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $810 million, down about 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 21.1% of revenue, within our expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.57 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our topline over the long-term. Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of this year, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Restructuring charges/other was a credit of $36 million due to the sale of our Greenock, Scotland facility. Operating profit was $1.51 billion, or 41.1% of revenue. Operating profit was down 12% from a year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 43.7%, down from 47% a year ago, and for Embedded Processing was 33.5%, down from 35.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time. Other income and expense was $52 million benefit, up $28 million primarily due to investment gains and tax-related items. Net income in the second quarter was $1.31 billion, or $1.36 per share, which included a $0.07 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we\u2019ve discussed. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.80 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $284 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.93 billion. In the second quarter, we paid $722 million in dividends and repurchased $863 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.59 billion. In total, we have returned $8.01 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 47% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.22 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. Total debt is $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.91%. Inventory days were 143, up eight days from a year-ago, and down one-day sequentially. We\u2019re pleased with the progress we have made replenishing inventory of low volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. Work in both of these areas will continue in the third quarter. We believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory and will manage it with our long-term objectives in mind. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.31 to $1.53, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% for 2019. In closing, we have just completed our third quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. As we stated last quarter, if you look at the last 30 years of history in our industry, cycles are always different, but typically you could see four to five quarters of year-on-year declines before year-on-year growth resumes. Again, we are not trying to forecast the cycle, but simply offer some historical perspective. Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach, and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products Analog and Embedded Processing and the best markets industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, when you reported three months ago, I think things we\u2019re looking somewhat more downbeat. And I was curious, Rafael or Dave, how would you characterize the current environment. Is it similar? Is it better? Is it worse? I'm just trying to put your Q3 outlook which is 3% to 4% sequential growth. It's below seasonal trend, but it's still up sequentially. So, I'm just going to get a better sense of how you're seeing the broader environment versus three months ago? Dave Pahl : Yes, I'll start, and if Rafael wants to add anything, he's welcome too. I think as we stated, the quarter came in about as we expected and that was really across the board. Really all the end markets performed about as we had expected. We\u2019ve just completed our third quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. And I think that if you look at history, things are always different when you look at cyclicality, but I think things are performing as we would expect. Rafael Lizardi : The only thing I would add is we're ready for any scenario. The economy strengthens, we're ready. If it run sideways or if it weakens, we're ready. And that's both a strategic comment on how we position the company, focus on auto and industrial and analog products inside of that, but also operationally with our inventory strategy and other things that we're doing to continue to strengthen the company. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on to that? Vivek Arya : Yes, thanks, Dave. So, for my follow-on, I'm curious the sales to China, how is the environment there? I assume that you don't have a lot of direct specific exposure to Huawei. But what's the demand environment I guess in China and outside of China? But are conditions better outside of China? And within China, how is the demand environment outside of Huawei? Dave Pahl : So, I think we've said before that Huawei is about 3% to 4% of our revenue overall. It's a mix of comms equipment and some handset in there and some other products. And if you look at comms equipment overall, it's 11% of our revenue. We had seen some nice growth in our 5G products, as we've talked about before. And if you look from a regional standpoint, I'd say there's nothing unusual going on. We've talked about that in the past when there was. And certainly, if you look at where we ship product, that's not always indicative of actual end demand or \u2013 and look-through those economies, meaning we may ship into one region and that may get packaged up and shipped to another region before it's actually consumed. So overall, about the regions, they came in as we expected and nothing unusual. We didn't see anything unusual this quarter. So, thank you for that. We\u2019ll go to next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We are here now from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Okay. Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. Guys, based on the comments that you just made, it appears as though your view on the cycle hasn't really changed over the past couple of months. That said, I think you guys decided to delay the new fab. So just curious what kind of thought process went into the decision to push the fab? Dave Pahl : Yes. So just to clarify, we said back in our February capital management call and really have been saying since then, that we planned to begin building that next factory in the next few years, and that hasn't changed. There was a filing and it was a proposed amendment to a local tax abatement schedule that has caused some confusion on that topic. But just to say again, as we said back in February, those plans hadn't changed. Do you have a follow-on? Toshiya Hari : I do. Thanks Dave. And then just going back to the U.S., China situation, I realize your business tends to be very sticky. But has the backdrop impacted your ability to conduct business in China at all? Or have you sensed any \u2013 just the market share in your business? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : No. This is Rafael. No, not at all. Dave Pahl : Yes, and I'd just say that our markets, because they're diverse and you see market share doesn't move around quickly, it's just good quality markets. And one of our competitive advantages being diversity and longevity I think helps us in markets like this in situations like that in particular, so. Okay. Thank you, Toshiya. We'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you very much. I had a question on gross margin flow-through, fall-through and especially as it relates to utilization and inventory. So free cash flow 12 months trailing, which you always point us too correctly, which is kind of in the same ballpark that you had last quarter, but then inventory was down. And the fall through the margins is much higher incrementally, and I know it's not the same every quarter, but I was just curious if there's something going on there. What are the puts and takes that caused the incremental fall through to be higher? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. And I'll take that. From the way you want to think about it is our fall through, as we have said before, is about 70% to 75%. And you want to look at that on a year-on-year basis. And even then, this is sometimes a little less, a little more but that's the right way to look at it, and this quarter is actually right between that 70% and 75%. The other thing I would mention is over the longer-term period, over the last many years and we expect this to continue, you're seeing the benefit of 300-millimeter manufacturing. That is part of our competitive advantage, manufacturing technology. And as we have talked about before, it's just a structural cost advantage because of the geometry of the wafer and the relatively small incremental cost that goes into producing the 300-millimeter wafer versus 200-millimeter wafer. So, we expect that benefit to continue to accrue to gross margins and ultimately free cash flow margin, which is the one that drives value for the owners of the company. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes, I did and this is more blocking and tackling and I know you guys have correctly frame from calling a cycle because everybody's track record, including my owners absolutely wrong on that front, but bookings, cancellations and lead times, where are we on these metrics? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. I think if you look at those metrics overall, I'd say that inventory in the channel, and more broadly, I think you're looking at kind of the cyclical metrics that you looked at. Inventory and channel was down about a day. Still, it's about 4.5 weeks and has been steady at that for a couple of quarters now. Order rates, when we look at those looked normal as they came through. Cancellations were down a little bit from last quarter, but really didn't change much. And then our lead times overall have remained stable. Certainly, they were stable as things got more heated in the industry, but \u2013 and of course there's always areas that we would still be tight on today, but in general, the lead times have remained very stable, so. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Ambrish. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just on Huawei. You answered sort of generally, but specifically, what do you have embedded in your guidance regarding Huawei? Are you still contemplating selling product to them? Or are you not? What's in the guidance regarding that customer? Dave Pahl : Yes. So, I\u2019d say, Stacy, just over this past quarter, we obviously had halted shipments when the order was given. Since then, we've resumed shipments of the products that we've determined we could ship that are in compliance with the U.S. regulations. So overall, in this quarter, things came in as we expected. And as I stated before, that would be inclusive of communications equipment, where Huawei would sit. So, in our guidance, we obviously have that in for the quarter. And if there was something unusual that we are keeping out, our practice has been to call that out and there's nothing unusual that we're planning on. Do you have a follow-on? Stacy Rasgon : Yes, I do. Thank you. Well, the stockpiling and consignment overall strategy that you've been doing, it's been going on for a while. How much do you think that has increased utilization over the last few quarters as you've been rolling that out? And how much longer do you anticipate driving that strategy before it reaches completion? Rafael Lizardi : Let me start, and then, Dave, you want to \u2013 if you want to comment. But we've had an inventory strategy for many years. We just continue to tweak it over time, make it better, stronger. And as the cycle started in third quarter or so, then we deploy some specific tools during that time to then take advantage of that situation and use what we call our wafer starts. We devoted an increasing share of that to the low-volume inventory strategy. We have built a lot of that but it's not complete. But incrementally, it's going to be less going forward than what it was in the last few quarters because you get to obviously diminishing returns at some point in that. Dave Pahl : Yes. And I'll point out, obviously, you saw our inventory dollars were down sequentially. They're actually down year-on-year. Our inventory days were down sequentially even with those planned builds of those low-volume parts, and we feel really good about being able to do that in our operations. The second part of your question there was what is the impact of consignment have on utilization. It really has no impact at all. Basically, it optically and, by definition, just puts more inventory on our books. But even if the inventory didn\u2019t change in the channel, it just would put pressure and optically put pressure on our inventory, and that's going on as well. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. I want to make one more comment on this topic. Remember what inventory is about, right? What is objective inventory? It's not about maximizing utilization or gross margins or anything like that. It\u2019s about maintaining high levels of customer service. So, what we have done is deployed our cash to inventory. And as Dave said, inventory actually decreased. But we think that decrease, we built some inventory of low-volume parts. That now puts us in a great position as we move into the third quarter and beyond. You have that inventory of low volume that is generally difficult to build. We have it ready, so that we'll be able to serve our customers on the other side of this very well. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Stacy. And we will go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We will hear now from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. May I ask a question? I want to stick on the consignment topic, but just a slightly different spin. I think you've said in the last call, last few calls that it's upwards of two-thirds of your revenues go through consignment. That's increased substantially over the last three, five, 10 years. Why do you think your year-over-year revenue performance is so similar to your broader peer group if you're controlling that inventory? I would think all else being equal, you wouldn't have to deal with the distribution channel burning inventory and weighing on your revenues during a period like this. Rafael Lizardi : I'll give you one comment, and Dave, you may want to chime in. What I would tell you is, maybe take into account, in the last four quarters or so, five quarters, we have gone through the next phase of consignment and we have added, let's say, $30 million to $40 million of revenue to that program per quarter during that time, for a total of close to $200 million. We probably still have one more quarter to go where that is \u2013 where that's going to happen and maybe through the end of the year, but it's getting to the diminishing point. But that is revenue that from the P&L we had sort of disappeared, right, but obviously the demand hasn't changed. That end demand really hasn't changed. It's just that now it goes into our inventory and the revenues delayed, but it just puts us in a much better position to then own that inventory, distribute it better where it's needed, work with our manufacturing facilities better to determine what's needed to be built for \u2013to replenish that inventory. So, it's just a better way to operate. Dave Pahl : Yes, and I'll just to add that when you think of one of our competitive advantage, which is the reach of our market channels, this is just one component of what we're doing to have a closer, more direct relationship with our customers. And we think that ultimately servicing them better with product will benefit them and therefore benefit us. Do you have a follow-on, Ross? Ross Seymore : Yes, one that's a little bit more housekeeping, Dave. From an end market point of view, you went through and gave the year-over-years. So, could you give the quarter-over-quarters beyond the comms side? And was there a reason you put industrial and automotive together saying there were down upper single-digits year-over-year? Usually, you split those? Dave Pahl : No. Yes. Sure. So, the first is they performed similarly. Industrial was a little weaker. Auto was a little less weak but in the same zip code, and that was the same for the sequential. Together, they grew low single-digits and that same profile was the same. Personal electronics grew high single-digits with broad-based seasonal growth. Comms equipment, as I mentioned earlier, had declined, and then enterprise systems actually grew sequentially. Okay, thank you, Ross. And we\u2019ll go the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now hear from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at the most recent SIA data, April, May sales were down about 10% year-over-year for the global Analog segment, while you guys were only down 6%. You clearly outperformed the Analog segment last year as well. So outside of the end market mix, i.e., better comm equipment sector. Can you guys help us understand any product areas where you're either capturing market share or seeing strong dollar content growth? Dave Pahl : Well, yes, so first, Harlan, I\u2019d always be careful to read too much into any of those numbers in the short-term. I think when you look at the share gains, they just really need to be even over several year. And I think that's \u2013 even in that case, I think we come out very well. I think especially we continue to do well in industrial and automotive. As I mentioned earlier, that is, we believe that those will be the most important markets to semiconductors and industrial in particular. And we've got a lot of programs and a lot of thought going into how to get better and get stronger to be able to service those markets. Do you have a follow-on? Harlan Sur : Yes. Thanks for the insights there. I know we have to be careful on how we interpret this number, but can you guys just tell us what the book-to-bill ratio is for the June quarter? Dave Pahl : Yes. So, you set me up perfect there, because I always have the preamble that I'll give it. I've debated honestly whether I should continue to give it, but I will. Just because we do, but there is a lot of noise that's in it. So, it was 0.94% and it was 1.06% a year-ago and 0.99% last quarter, so and I'll just remind everyone that we have the majority of the revenue on consignment. So, we don't get orders in advance for that. We've got backlog and the consignment the orders in the backlog are all consistent with the guidance that we gave. So, thank you Harlan. And I believe we will go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear now from Chris Danley with Citigroup. Christopher Danely : Hey. Thanks, guys. Can you just talk about the linearity of orders during the quarter? And I guess more specifically, have you seen any change in customer or channel behavior since the Huawei reinstatement and the \u2013 I guess the threat of $300 billion in additional tariffs was taken away a few weeks ago? Dave Pahl : Yes, Chris. Really no changes on that front, I think when we look at the linearity, it came in fairly normal, minus the stock shipment to Huawei. But once we determined that we could continue to resume most of those products. It really got back to normal pretty quickly. Do you have a follow-on? Christopher Danely : Yes. Given, we're in this \u2013 I guess mildly depressed or sluggish or flaccid or whatever you want to call it kind of environment. Have you guys changed your thoughts on kind of long-term CapEx? Rafael Lizardi : The short answer is, no. We are \u2013 as we said in our capital management strategy, our guide on CapEx is 6% and we'll continue to be 6% and that's without buildings. So of course, as we've talked about, we announced the new factory \u2013 the new 300 millimeter factory that we build in Richardson, Texas in the next few years. Outside of that, we'll be running about 6%. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Chris. And operator, I think we\u2019ve got time for one more call. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Mark Lipacis : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me okay? Dave Pahl : We can, Mark. Mark Lipacis : Okay. Your inventories declined in dollars and days. What do you think happens to your inventories on your balance sheet in the September quarter? And Dave, on the inventory commentary, I believe you said you characterized channel inventory as kind of in a stable range. Would you call them stable in a normal and healthy level? Or would you characterize them somewhat differently? Rafael Lizardi : Let me start, and Dave, if you want to jump in. But let me first step back to the objective for inventory to remind everybody and, as I said earlier in the call, is to maintain high levels of customer service. We also want to minimize obsolesces of that inventory and improve our asset utilization, but the main thing is to maintain high levels of customer service. And our target is 1.15 to 1.45. So last quarter \u2013 two quarters ago, we went above that target, 1.52. But then last quarter, we're at 1.44 in one \u2013 first quarter and then second quarter, we just finished at 1.43, so both of those inside of our target. Dave Pahl : Yes. And I\u2019ll just add again that even outside of those numbers, we\u2019ve made really good progress of executing to building those low volume parts and we believe that's important, so we can continue to service customers well. In the second part of your question, Mark was, yes, it was down a little bit sequentially on the day\u2019s basis in distribution, still at about 4.5 weeks. That is a healthy level. And I would say that, that number will structurally kind of work its way down as we're implementing more of this revenue on consignment, and that's a great thing for our distributors. It's a great thing for our customers and it does require that we\u2019ll be carrying some more inventory on our balance sheet, but we think that, that's a good investment in working capital. Do you have a follow-on, Mark? Mark Lipacis : Yes, please. Thank you. The follow-up is, have you been noticing since the U.S. and China trade debate. Have you been noticing any shift in the supply chain from a standpoint of where things are being manufactured not your own Texas Instruments supply chain, but where you're shipping to \u2013 are you shipping more outside of China or is everything fairly stable? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, I'll take that. It's too early to tell. We read some of the same media reports and anecdotal comments that people make on that front, but it's too early to tell. So, we'll watch how things evolve in that front over the next few years. So, I want to finish with a few comments on key items for everybody to remember. We will remain focused on analog and embedded, the best products; and industrial and automotive, the best markets. We will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy, and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company. And finally, we continue to believe growing free cash flow per share dollars over the long-term is what will maximize value for the owners of the company. Dave Pahl : Thank you for listening. A replay will be available on the web and have a good night. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I will be covering the following topics : First, a high-level summary of the financial results for the third quarter. Second, given the additional weakness we have seen, I will provide some comments about what we are seeing with added insight by segment and end market. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and then the outlook, after which will open the call for Q&A Starting with a high-level summary of our third quarter financial results. Revenue decreased 11% from a year ago and came in below the midpoint of our guidance as we saw most end markets continued to weaken further. In our core businesses, analog revenue declined 8% and embedded processing revenue declined 19% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Both business' year-on-year year growth decelerated. Earnings per share were $1.49, including a $0.09 benefit for items not in our original guidance due to discrete tax benefits. With that backdrop, I will now provide details on our performance. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow to owners. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-months period was $6 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 41% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or if it's returned to owners. For the trailing 12-months period, we returned $7.4 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating our confidence in the business model and our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners. Moving on, I will now provide some details on the third quarter by segment and end market. For the year ago quarter, analog revenue declined 8% due to declines in power, signal chain and high volume. Embedded processing revenue declined 19% from the year ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers. All markets declined across embedded, but the declines were most pronounced in the automotive and communications equipment markets. Other declined by 19% from the year ago quarter due to DLP and custom ASICs. Next, I will provide some comments on what we are seeing in the market and insight into this quarter's performance by end market versus a year ago. As we said, when you look at 30 years of history, semiconductor cycles can vary widely but typically experienced four to five quarters of year-on-year declines before returning to positive growth. We have also said that the current trade tensions could impact the depth and duration of the cycle. We have provided these comments as contexts not as a prediction about the current cycle. With the end of this current quarter, we have now experienced our fourth consecutive quarter of negative year-on-year growth. There is an increasing number of reports of macroeconomic weakness with trade tensions as the primary contributor. Consistent with this, the weakness we have seen in the third quarter was broad-based across all markets and most sectors. Industrial, automotive and personal electronics, all declined upper single digits from the year ago as almost all 28 sectors within these markets declined. In communications equipment, revenue declined about 35% from the year ago and 20% sequentially. We saw weakness across all major customers, regions and technologies. And lastly, enterprise systems declined from the year ago quarter. We have learned over the years that staying focused on building the company stronger, especially in the face of a weak market provides great long term rewards. We continue to invest in and leverage our competitive advantages. The breadth of our product portfolio and channels to market including our direct sales and applications team as well as TI.com provides us the broadest reach to your customer base, a unique advantage. We have been evolving our distribution network over the years and continue to do so today as we build stronger direct relationships with our customers. We remain focused on analog and embedded, the best products. We remain focused on industrial and automotive, the best market. They will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets as they have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and the outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.45 billion or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $778 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 22% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.56 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our topline over the long term. Acquisition charges and non-cash expense were $79 million. Acquisition charges will decline to about $50 million in the fourth quarter and will remain at that level through the third quarter of 2021. Operating profit was $1.59 billion or 42% of revenue. Operating profit was down 18% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 46%, down from 50% a year ago and for embedded processing was 32%, down from 35% a year ago. Despite current weakness, our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time. Other income and expense was a $34 million benefit, up $11 million from a year ago. Net income in the third quarter was $1.43 billion or $1.49 per share, which included a $0.09 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.99 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $149 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-months basis was $6.03 billion. In September, we announced we would increase our quarterly dividend by 17%, marking our 16th year of dividend increases. In the quarter, we paid $721 million in dividends and repurchased $456 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.18 billion. In total, we have returned $7.38 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 48% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.07 billion of cash and short term investments at the end of the third quarter. In the quarter, we repaid $750 million of debt and issued $750 million of debt with a coupon of 2.25% due in 10 years. This results in total debt of $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.99%. Inventory days were 139, up eight days from a year ago and down four days sequentially. We are pleased with the progress we have made replenishing inventory of low volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs. Work in both of these areas is mostly complete. Given the weaker environment, we have reduced wafer starts to align with demand. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 to $3.33 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.91 to $1.09, which includes an estimated $5 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% for 2019, As a reminder, acquisition charges will decline to about $50 million in the fourth quarter and remain at that level through the third quarter of 2021. In closing, as Dave mentioned, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, analog and embedded processing and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which we believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. The first one is on the Q4 outlook. How do we get confidence that this isn't company specific or share loss, because when we looked at some of the SIA data for July and August, it was more positive. So is it anything that is company specific in Q4, because the guidance is substantially below? We understand the macro environment is not that great. But is there anything one-off company specific that is impacting your guidance? Is there any share loss issue? Any other color that you could provide would be very helpful. Dave Pahl : Yes. Vivek, I will take that. I would say, state the obvious, obviously the SIA numbers are more backward-looking versus the looking into fourth quarter. And I think when you judge share and we have talked about this in past, but you really need to judge it over multiple quarters. You look at the diversity of our revenue. We talk about one of our competitive advantages being diversity and longevity. Our biggest the product last year, as an example, was about 0.8% of our total revenue. So just that diversity, I think, has served us well and will continue to serve us well. Do you have a follow-on? Vivek Arya : Yes. Thanks Dave. Somewhat more longer term, there is a lot of discussion of parallel technology in semis ecosystem developing in China as it tries to get more self-sufficient. How well is TI placed from a competitive perspective? Do you think there are substitutes for your kind of analog and embedded products from Chinese vendors over some intermediate timeframe? And what would TI need to do different as a company to react to this new ecosystem? Dave Pahl : Yes. I will start off. I think if you look at the analog and the embedded market, they have got many natural competitive moats that sit around the marketplace overall. I think that we have certainly heard discussions of Chinese customers wanting to ensure that they have alternatives. But it's very different than being designed out. So our customers overall are very pragmatic. They are looking for components with the highest performance, the lowest cost and the most dependable delivery. So I think we will continue to focus on those things. And they have served us well in the past and we believe it will continue to serve us well in the future. Thank you Vivek. We will go to the next caller, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to follow-up on a little bit around Q4. We have been in this environment for a while. I think you had your first guide for cut actually on this call a year ago. But even on that call, you had guided Q4 2018 down about 12% sequentially which was obviously below. We are a later. We have had a number of rounds of cuts. So the base is even lower and now you are guiding Q4 2019 down by 50% sequentially. So it's even worse on a sequential basis than we saw in the year ago quarter when we started. I guess it's and again it's not like things have been weak all along. I guess if you can give us some kind of an indication, maybe what could get immediately worse? Is this your Huawei pull-forward working off? Is this something going on because your distribution strategy is different from your competitors? I guess anything you can give us around the tactical near term environment driving the Q4 guide would be helpful, just given what we have seen over the last year or so in those trends? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Stacy, thanks for the question. Let me take a shot at that. And then Dave will follow-up with other comments. But our sense is that customers are just far more cautious than they were certainly a year ago, but even 90 days ago. And many of them, when talk about the caution, they mentioned the trade tensions that we know have been happening and have been accumulating over the last three or four quarters. And the consistency of that breadth of weakness supports that this is a macro situation that is driving the further weakness that we are seeing. Dave Pahl : You have got a follow-on? Stacy Rasgon : I do. So you have talk about evolving your distribution strategy and relationships. Do you think it's possible that any of those activities as you disintermediate more of them maybe having like a near term negative impact on your revenue outlook because you can rely on them less to do things like demand generation and the like? Is there, I guess, any change you have made recently you think could be having any sort of impact on the near term horizon? Dave Pahl : Yes. Simply in a word, I would just say, no, Stacy. I think establishing a more direct relationship with our customer just yields more rewards than it does the risk. And it gives us greater access to those customers. And you have seen us evolve that over the last several years and we have made investments in order to provide very high levels of service for our customers, especially as we move to a more direct business model. And these investments include the things that you have heard us talk about, the new capabilities and in some cases improved capabilities to our website, e-commerce enhancements for demand creation, inventory consignment programs that we have talked about on the last the last few calls and other things like order fulfillment services. So these improved capabilities combined with our sales and applications organization which by the way is the largest in the semiconductor industry just help us provide great product and great support to our customers. And that's really what we have been focused on. Thank you. And we will go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Pitzer : Yes. Thank guys. Thanks for letting me ask questions. Dave, I just want to go back to the embedded. When I look at how your analog business trending, it's about in line with our expectations and quite frankly, what your peer group is doing. But when I look at embedded, it seems to be demonstrably worse. In fact, if Q4 is down sequentially equally across all segments, you will be down peak to trough this cycle in embedded, more so than you were in the 2009 financial crisis when financial markets weren't working properly and companies couldn't actually get funding for inventory. So I just want to kind of go back and kind of understand why you think the embedded business is doing so poorly relative to overall kind of industry trends? Is that really where the comms weakness comes in? If you can help me understand that a little bit better, it would be helpful. Dave Pahl : Yes. And John, to put it in context, we talked about at the company level, so including analog and embedded that all the markets were week, that when we saw the sectors that make up those markets that most of them were weak. But that weakness was just more pronounced directionally the same but just more pronounced in embedded. And you know, we did see and if you look now just inside of embedded, we saw a more pronounced weakness in automotive and in communications. So again, I think that those types of things need to be measured over longer periods of time. And so I wouldn't judge that business on any one quarter results overall. You have a follow-on, John? John Pitzer : Yes. Just as a follow-up, just going back to the comms part of the business. So I am just kind of curious, not that the macro is all that strong, but to what extent can you quantify, if at all, the impact from bans? Is this way Huawei having ordered a lot more inventory throughout the year than you thought? Is this a certain company or region? Just on the comms side, any color you can give on the weakness would be helpful. Dave Pahl : Yes. I think we can't rule out, obviously, you know customers having built inventory in preparations for builds or concerns with the trade tensions. But the weakness that we saw wasn't limited to any region. That was very broad-based. When we look at the largest customers inside of comms equipment, that was across the largest customers. And again, we talked about that it was across the technologies. So it's really broad-based, the weakness. So not just one customer or not just one technology or not just one region. So hopefully that color helps. Thank you, John. We will go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Ross Seymore : Dave, you gave the year-over-year comments and then the sequentials for the comm equipment. But I think we are all trying to solve the main problem of kind of why is your guidance so weak in the fourth quarter? To the extent it provides any clues, could you give us what the quarter-over-quarter sequentials were by the end markets outside of the comm, which you already gave? Dave Pahl : Sure. Industrial and automotive declined low single digits, Ross. Personal electronics grew midteens and that was based on really just seasonal growth that we would expect to see. We already commented on comms equipment declining about 20%. And then enterprise systems grew in the quarter. You have a follow-on? Ross Seymore : Yes. I guess one on the cash return side of things. I know one quarter doesn't necessarily make a trend, but you guys have been ridiculously consistent in a positive way with your buyback over time. I know you raised the dividend this last quarter. But I think the share repurchase was the lowest since I believe the second quarter of 2012, if my model is right. And the aggregate of the two, the dividend and the buyback, were meaningfully less than the free cash flow in the quarter. I know it's not just one quarter, but is there anything at that explains why the buyback was significantly lower than it's been in any time in recent history? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. I would tell you and that is I will take you back to our capital management strategy and our objectives to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. And as you pointed out, we do that through buybacks and dividends. And on a trailing 12-month basis which is a better way to look at all these things, to give you just a better trend of what's going on, we have returned $7.4 billion of cash and our free cash flow has been $6 billion during that time. So we have returned 122% of free cash during that time. So a pretty healthy amount. And in the last quarter, we returned or we bought back $456 million. As long as the stock price is below our assessment of intrinsic, we will be buying back shares and we did buy a healthy amount in third quarter. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. And I will just add to that, that as Rafael said, it's quite best to look at the free cash flow metrics on a trailing 12-month basis, as there is seasonality. Third and fourth quarter tend to be stronger than first and second on that. So that usually provides a better insight. Thank you Ross. And we will go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore : Yes. I wonder if you could give us more color, I mean you have talked about your customers being more cautious. But to what degree do you think that's demand being softer that's different inventory behavior? And I guess on the flipside, I mean it doesn't seem like you are seeing a lot of inventory accumulation around the tariff activities. But just could you just generally comment on the state of your customers' inventories as you move to the last quarter? Thanks. Dave Pahl : Yes. Joe, I will make a comment and if Rafael wants to add something to it, certainly jump in, Rafael. But you know, when we look at inventory in the channel, it was actually down a little bit sequentially, still at about four-and-a-half weeks. So really not changing much overall. We still have about two-thirds of our revenue supported by consignment overall. So we know that inventory remains at zero because of those consignment programs. So they continue to be in a healthy state. The rest of that, we can't see into our customers' inventories and down channel. So our visibility really ends at that point. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. The only thing I would add, I can sense that you collectively are unsatisfied with our answers and I understand that. We have close to 100,000 different customers and we sell about 100,000 different products. It's difficult to pinpoint any one thing. But the sense we get talking to those customers, getting input from them, from our salespeople and all the touch points that we have is that the weakness is broad-based, is due to macro events and specifically the trade tensions. And if you think about when there is tensions in trade and obstacles to trade, what do businesses do? They become more cautious and they pull back. And we are at the very end of our long supply chain and when the ones at the very front pullback, it becomes a traffic jam. So our sense is that is what's happening in the marketplace. But we will see what other companies will report over time and we will get a clear picture over the next several weeks and really quarters, because this thing we have been in it for now four quarters and it's going to be longer than that. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-on, Joe? Joe Moore : Yes. And thanks for the color. I do appreciate you guys clarifying what's going on. In terms of the wafer start reduction in the fourth quarter, can you just talk about, I guess normally you have talked about a 70% incremental gross margin in both directions, anything kind of different as you think about Q4 because of the fact of that wafer start comment that you made? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Actually, no, not any different to the larger degree. We have talked about 70% to 75% fall through. And that's a guide. It could be a little less, a little more. So that's probably how you want to think about it on a year-on-year basis for fourth quarter. We did lower wafer starts in third quarter inside of the quarter and we are lowering those further into fourth quarter. And that's a capital allocation decision. When we do that we save cash, right. And we have, to a larger degree, built the buffer strategy that we have talked about. So we will save cash as we do that and that makes sense for the owners of the company. There is cash that's freed up for other purposes. That will hit the GPM line, but it will do so about as expected. So as I say, you have seen a fall through that we have talked about in the big scheme of things. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you Joe. We will go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : Hi. Thanks. Q4 OpEx is usually down low to mid singles. I am just trying to see if that's the right number for December that's in the guidance? Dave Pahl : OpEx, well, first remember, the objective of OpEx is to fuel our long term growth and these are long term investments that pay off over many, many years, in many cases decades. So that's how we think about. In this environment, we are cautious and we want to be prudent. But we are not cutting back on those long term investments. On a trailing 12-month basis, OpEx has been running pretty steady at about $3.2 billion for at least a year or so, if you look at trailing 12-month at the end of every quarter for the last three or four quarters. And it is overall is down about 1% versus a year ago. But of course, revenue has been dropping more than that. So then, as a percent of revenue, it's gone up a little bit. So now it's at 20%. And that's well within our expectation, our guide of 20% to 25% for that metric. You have a follow up? Timothy Arcuri : Sure. I guess with respect to the loadings commentary, does it make you rethink the timing on the new 300 millimeter fab, if you can give us an update there? Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Sure. So first, let me remind you, of course when it comes to CapEx, particularly for that fab, it's all about driving long term revenue growth and extending our manufacturing advantage, including 300 millimeter. And that is one of our key competitive advantages. We are now in the process of building a parking structure that will be complete in the first half of next year. Once we build that, that will enable us to build the building for the next 300 millimeter factory. Our plan continues to be to build that building within the next few years. And as a reminder, that will cost $600 million to $700 million over a couple of years as we build that building. And $600 million to $700 million, it is a sizable amount. But the big expense comes from the equipment that would follow. And in fact an even bigger one will be the opportunity cost of not having that available, if there s, or when there is growth on the other side of these things. So we think about all of those things and based on that we have laid our plans at the moment. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you Tim. We can go to our next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from CJ Muse of Evercore. Please go ahead. CJ Muse : Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to revisit comments around China and the potential for pull-ins. If I look back at your June quarter, that business was up about 6% year-on-year where everything else was down 1%. And so I guess as you look back and you think forward, do you have a sense that was in fact pull-ins in the prior quarters and that's perhaps exacerbating what you are seeing into the December quarter? Dave Pahl : Yes. I think that, so first I spent eight years of my career in sales and I like the job. I never once took a double order or saw a customer do a pull-in, right. But so certainly wouldn't rule that out as a possibility. But I think more of what you are seeing there is just seasonality as customers prepare more of the PE products, our products are shipped into China than any other region. So that has an effect that's in there as well. So again, I won't rule it out. But you have got some seasonality that's going on with that. You have a follow-on? CJ Muse : I do. You talked broad based weakness. But I was hoping perhaps you could narrow in on auto and give a little more color on what you are seeing there, either geographically or by sub-segment? Dave Pahl : Yes. So we have got five sectors that are inside of that. All the sectors saw weakness. I made the comment that if you look at the sectors across industrial and even personal electronics, that most of those sectors were down. So automotive was no different from that front. And I would say that from a regional standpoint, we saw weakness across all of the regions. So nothing really significant there to spike out. Okay. Thank you CJ. And with that, we have got time for one last caller. Operator? Operator : Our last question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Please go ahead. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the linearity of the orders? So obviously there's been some weakening. And I am just wondering if you already started to see that this summer? Or was it sort of something more that came later in the quarter? Dave Pahl : Yes. So I would say that it was weak throughout the quarter. It wasn't last couple of week or last 30-day phenomenon. I would also point out we have got two-thirds of our revenue on consignment. So in those arrangements, we get the order and ship them instantaneously at the same time. So revenues and orders really reflect each other for the most part. Do you have follow-on, Tore? Tore Svanberg : Yes. I had a follow-on for Rafael. So you have done a tremendous job on gross margin. Revenues down 12% year-over-year but gross margin only down 90 basis points. And now your inventory days were down as well sequentially. I know you talked a little bit about the factory loadings in Q4. But should we think about some sort of a inventory days target that you want to run the business at next few quarters? Rafael Lizardi : So good question. Let me first step back and remind you how we think about inventory, okay. Inventory, the objective there is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence and improve our asset utilization. We have a guide of 115 to 145, but those are not concrete barriers, right. It's just a guide there. We are going to do the right thing for the business. So for example, in this situation, in the current environment, even though we have decreased those wafer starts, it is likely that we go above the top of that range or it's at least possible that we do just because of where the revenue midpoint is. Now we are not going to go drive the wafer starts in a draconian way to just to stay within those guidelines. That would not make sense in one quarter. But over one, two, three quarters then the idea is to, that guidelines just provide an area where we should aim at and we can achieve our objectives, the inventory objectives I talked about, while deploying and allocating capital in the best way that benefits the interest of the long term owners of the company. Dave Pahl : So with that, let me just finish with a few comments on some key items for you to remember. We will remain focused on analog and embedded, the best products and industrial and automotive, the best markets. Next, we will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company. Lastly, we continue to believe growing free cash flow per share over the long term. It's why we will maximize value for the owners of the company. Rafael Lizardi : Thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call is also available on our website. Good evening. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call to review our capital management strategy on February 4 at 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy. For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll be covering the following topics : first, a high-level summary of the financial results for the fourth quarter; second, I'll provide some comments about what we're seeing with added insight by segment and end market and explain why we would characterize the market as showing signs of stabilizing; and finally, since this is the end of the calendar year, I'll provide a summary of our performance by end market for 2019. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and then the outlook, after which we'll open the call for Q&A. Starting with a high-level summary of the fourth quarter financial results. Revenue was $3.35 billion, a decrease of 10% from a year ago, and EPS was $1.12 per share, including a $0.01 benefit not in our original guidance. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our guidance with a relative strength across all markets. At the company level, our year-on-year decline abated slightly from 11% in the third quarter to 10% in the fourth quarter. While this is only a marginal improvement, all end markets reduced the rate of decline substantially with the exception of communications equipment where the year-over-year decline increased about as expected given the strength in this end market in the year ago quarter. In fourth quarter 2019, Analog revenue declined 5% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 20% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Analog's year-on-year rate of decline went from 8% in the third quarter to 5% in the fourth quarter, and Embedded's decline slightly increased from 19% to 20% over the same period. When we look at the market, since 90 days ago, we moved from the third quarter where customers were increasingly cautious to the fourth quarter where results and behavior throughout the quarter reflected what we believe is best described as demand stabilizing. Based on history, this would imply that customer and channel inventory that built up during 2017 and '18 would now mostly be depleted. This suggests that demand this year will be more a function of our customers' end demand and, therefore, the macro economy, which may continue to be uncertain. Moving on, I'll now provide some details on the fourth quarter by segment and end market. From the year ago quarter, Analog revenue declined 5% due to declines in Signal Chain, High Volume and Power. Embedded Processing revenue declined 20% from the year ago quarter primarily due to Processors, Connected Microcontrollers also declined. Our Other segment declined 24% from the year ago quarter. For the year in total, Analog declined 5% and Embedded declined 17%. Analog and Embedded combined were 92% of revenue. From an end market perspective, in the fourth quarter, all markets declined year-on-year 3% to 4%, with the exception of communications equipment. Communications equipment declined about 50% from the year ago quarter, about as expected as all major customers, geographies and technologies declined. Next, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2019. We break this into six categories : industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for the year, industrial was 36%; automotive, 21%; personal electronics, 23%; communications equipment, 11%; enterprise systems 6%; and other was 3%. Looking at the changes versus 2018, automotive increased by 1 percentage point, enterprise systems decreased by 1 percentage point and the remaining markets were unchanged. In 2019, industrial and automotive combined made up 57% of TI's revenue, up 1 percentage point from last year and up from 42% in 2013. We've established momentum in these markets, and we see great opportunity ahead.[ Next, one of our competitive advantages is diversity and longevity, which can be measured in multiple dimensions. From a diversity perspective, we have over 100,000 customers and tens of thousands of devices. In 2019, almost 2/3 of our revenue came from customers who bought $100 million or less of our products. In 2019, our top 10 devices represented about 5% of our revenue, and the top 100th device was less than 0.1% of our revenue. From a longevity perspective, over 40% of our revenue came from devices that we've been producing for at least 10 years. Our investments are directed to continue to diversify our growth across products, markets and customers, strengthening this competitive advantage. Next, we are announcing today that we will be closing our last 2 6-inch or 150-millimeter wafer fabs, which are both more than 50 years old. This will be a multiyear plan and is expected to be completed no earlier than 2023 and no later than 2025. There are no charges in this quarter's results, and we'll keep you updated as needed in the future. Separately, our plans to build our next 300-millimeter factory in Richardson, Texas, are underway with dirt moving and cranes on site. We expect the building shell to be complete by the end of 2021 and ready to install tools when needed to meet market demand, which will allow us to continue to support growth and strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage. So to wrap up, we remain focused on Analog and Embedded, the best products. We remain focused on the industrial and automotive markets, the best markets and still be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets as they have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion or 63% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 220 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $798 million, down 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 22% of revenue. For the year, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We're pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long term. Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $50 million. Acquisition charges will remain at about $50 million through the third quarter of 2021. Operating profit was $1.2 billion or 37% of revenue. Operating profit was down 18% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 42%, down from 47% a year ago; and for Embedded Processing was 25%, down from 30% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time. Other income and - net income in the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion or $1.12 per share, which included a $0.01 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $163 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.8 billion, down 4% from a year ago. In the quarter, we paid $841 million in dividends, an increase of 17% per share, marked our 16th year of dividend increases. We repurchased $489 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.3 billion. In total, we have returned $6 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the same period, our dividends represented 52% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt was $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.99%. Inventory days were 144, down eight days from a year ago and up five days sequentially. We are pleased with our inventory, and it is positioned to support growth. Now let's look at some of these results for a year. In 2019, cash flow from operations was $6.6 billion. Capital expenditures were $847 million or 6% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2019 was $5.8 billion or 40% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all free cash flow to owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $3 billion in dividends and purchased $3 billion of our own shares, reducing outstanding share count by 1.4% in 2019 and by 46% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $1.14, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our 2020 annual operating tax rate to be above 15%. As usual, details of our expectations for taxes can be found on our IR website under Financial Summary Data. In closing, as Dave mentioned, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages with our manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which we believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : Congratulations on the solid results. I guess, Dave and Rafael, just relative to the March quarter guidance, at the midpoint, you're guiding down about 3% sequentially, which is in line with kind of historic seasonality for the March quarter. But typically, off the bottom of the cycle, you can get some above seasonal. And at the midpoint, the year-over-year is just modestly getting better from December to March. So I'm just wondering what - if there's anything specific in the March quarter as to why it's not a little bit better than seasonal, and specifically, anything around distribution strategy that might be a headwind in Q1. And then I have a follow-up. Dave Pahl : Yes, John, I'll take that, and Rafael can add if he'd like. I think - so to answer the last part of that question, there's nothing in the sequential guidance that would suggest there's any headwinds from distribution. We've talked about before that we would expect as we make the transition in distribution, it will look similar from a revenue headwind as we've seen with consignment. So there will be some there, but we've already got some of the headwinds from the transitions that we've made in consignment. And I think the second part is as we're seeing those signs of stabilization, we talked about that history would suggest that the growth is going to reflect the end demand of the customers and, therefore, the macro economy. So as we go through the year, that's what will be the driving force overall. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. The only other thing I would add is, as Dave mentioned during the prepared remarks, our comms equipment was down year-on-year significantly as there was a tough compare a year ago. Well, 1Q '20 is going to have an even tougher compare on comms equipment. You may recall what was going on in 1Q '19 on that front. Dave Pahl : Right. Was growing pretty significantly year-on-year. Okay, John, do you have a follow-on? John Pitzer : Yes. And then my second question is just around the Embedded business. I know that the SIA MCU data is not necessarily the best proxy for that business. But when you kind of compare your results to that data, up until this most recent correction, you guys were sort of consistently outgrowing the SIA MCU data. Your Embedded business has now gone through 5 or 6 quarters of kind of undergrowing. And I'm just wondering if you could help us talk through maybe potential share loss. And I know you talked about CPU specifically being weak within Embedded, is that specific to an end market like comms? Or how do we think about that? Dave Pahl : Yes. So first, John, I think you're putting in a good context. And as you've stated, we believe share changes just need to be judged over long periods of time. And so if you look at the revenue performance of Embedded over the last several years, we've had that significant outperformance, as you pointed out, in '17 and '18. Last year, we probably gave some of that back. So I just point out that in the most recent quarter, at the TI level, so Analog and Embedded, we saw that - those signs of stabilization but - in every market, so behaving similarly except communications equipment. So thank you, John. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Trying to get to the trajectory and maybe the stabilization in turn. Dave, I know you said it was pretty broad-based on how you upsided the fourth quarter of last year. But can you give us what the sequential changes were by the end markets? I know you gave the year-over-year specifically, but if you could give that for the fourth quarter, that would be helpful. Dave Pahl : Yes, certainly, Ross. So these are all sequential compares. Industrial declined mid-single digits. Automotive was about even. Personal electronics declined high single digits. Comms equipment declined about 20%. And enterprise systems grew in the low single digits. Do you have a follow-on, Ross? Ross Seymore : Yes. I just wanted to think about the - you talked about shutting down the two 6-inch fabs. You told us about starting up the 300-millimeter. So maybe a two parter, if I may. Can you talk about the utilization plans in the first quarter? And how do we think about CapEx? I know you said you're moving dirt and you have cranes there, but out of that $600 million or $700 million cost that you said for the new 300-millimeter fab, how does that fold in, in 2020? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So Ross, you asked a bunch of questions there. Let me try. I'll answer the ones I remember. So first, let me emphasize, yes, we're closing two - our two fabs that still have some 150-millimeter equipment. And they're over 50 years old, and they'll be closed by as early as 2023 or as late as 2025, somewhere in that time frame. We have about $1.5 billion of revenue that run through those factories. And of course, we're moving most of that revenue, virtually all, to 300-millimeter, saw a significant cost advantage, as we have talked about over the years. The new factory, so let me talk about the new factory. Yes, we've got dirt moving, cranes are there, plans are underway. We should have the building finished by the end of 2021. And at that point, we can put equipment as needed to support demand. From a CapEx standpoint, you want to model that at 6% of revenue. We just finished 2019 with CapEx at 6% of revenue, and you should model that going forward at about that same level. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Ross. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Danley, Citigroup. Christopher Danely : I'm going to put the hindsight as 2020 theory to the test here. So now that we've kind of gone through this dip and recovery, maybe just talk about why you think your sales and bookings fell off so sharply in late summer. And then what's - why are the customers a little more, I guess, a little more optimistic right now? And then do you feel better about your business now versus, let's call it, six months ago over the summer? Dave Pahl : Okay. Well, I'll start off, and Rafael, if you want to add anything. I think as we go through any cycle, they're all similar in a lot of ways and different in others. And to put it in context, you'd have to go back to third quarter of '18. Running up to that, we had 10 quarters of year-on-year growth. So you never know as you're going through that you're going to have 10 or 12 or 14 quarters of year-on-year growth, but you expect at some point that the industry would run below. And so as we started that, we thought we were - what we were seeing was mostly an inventory - industry, rather, correction as we're working through that. Certainly, trade tensions, probably elongated that cycle and part of the reasons why we saw that other leg down later last year. And so - and can you remind me the second part - or do we feel better about the business. I think that strategically, we felt that we continue to stay focused on improving our four competitive advantages. We haven't slowed down investments, and we talk about our fabs underway. If you look at the OpEx investments that we have made, those have stayed steady, focused on areas of diversifying our growth in industrial and automotive. So I think we feel just as good today as we did about the business. The cycles will come and go. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. I would just add, as Dave mentioned, strategically, we are well positioned, have been, that hasn't changed. So we continue to feel as good as ever on that front. And then operationally, we just - we've got to be ready for whatever the market throws at us. So if this was - is going to last longer, we've got to be ready for that, if things are going to head south, but we also got to be ready if things turn around, and then we're going to start seeing year-on-year growth. So - and our business model allows us to do that, and we're well positioned for it. Dave Pahl : Great. Do you have a follow-on, Chris? Christopher Danely : Yes. Just a longer-term question on the Embedded Processing business. So if you look at the last couple of years, it has materially undergrown the overall business, and we're still running it, I think it's about 10% lower margins than the corporate average. So what are you guys thinking about? What should we be thinking about sort of the long-term goals or aspirations for the Embedded business just in terms of relative revenue growth or profits? Do we expect it to improve or not improve? And if it's not going to improve, is there anything you could do to change that? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. I'll give you a few comments on that. As far as expectations, you mentioned margin. Frankly, that's not - Embedded is lower margin than Analog, but that is a nonissue. As long as their - Embedded contributes to free cash flow growth, that's the measure in stake. Obviously, the top line has gone through some challenges here that Dave talked about earlier. But longer term, with their focus on auto and industrial, in all of our businesses, but that includes Embedded, we feel confident that, that business will grow longer term. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Chris. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : I was hoping to better understand what you're seeing in the comms business. I appreciate the year ago quarter was a high compare, but the business was down 50%, as Dave you noted. Curious how big Huawei was as a percentage of that decline in Q4. And more importantly, how are you guys thinking about the trajectory for this business into 2020? And then I have a follow-up. Dave Pahl : Sure. Yes. So Huawei last year was 3% to 4% of our revenue. That's really unchanged from what it was the prior year. And I think if you look at comms equipment overall, if you'll just look at the shape of the growth curve, you had the year kind of balanced with strong growth in the first part and followed by very weak growth in the second half. So the way that it's behaving, I don't think is - well, it isn't a surprise to us. As we were going through that very strong growth, we tried to remind everyone at the time that, that market is a market that's just choppy. And it's that way primarily in early phases of technology deployment. I think longer term, as we've talked about on our capital management presentation, we don't believe that, that will be a growth driver for us or for the industry, and that's just based on the number of subscribers that are out in the market and what the capital spending by operators will be longer term. So we really think that growth in our industry will be driven by industrial and automotive, and hence, why we've biased our investments into those areas. Do you have a follow-on? Toshiya Hari : Yes, great. And sort of related to that, Dave, it was encouraging to see R&D intensity or R&D as a percentage of sales pick up in 2019 versus 2018. I mean it had felt like R&D was in decline for a number of years, so it was good to see that pick up. Can you remind us which product areas, technologies, end markets that you guys are focused on? I realize it's going to be industrial and automotive, but if you can give a little bit more color within those two end markets, that would be helpful. Rafael Lizardi : So of course, from an end market standpoint, as you said, is industrial, automotive, that's where we're focusing. From a product standpoint is Embedded and Analog. But of course, inside of that, there's a bunch of pieces. So I'll mention a few. But I mean, at the highest level is - in the case of Analog is Signal Chain and Power. Those are by far the biggest areas. But - and underneath that, there's just a bunch of things. There's the - within Power, there's all kinds of power categories and then within Signal Chain. But Dave, do you want to add something? Dave Pahl : Yes. I'll just say when we think of allocating capital to R&D, there's really three major buckets. And the largest bucket is - goes directly to product - creation of new products. We release 300 to 400 new products a year. The other two is kind of a shared, centralized R&D function that develops our process technologies, packaging tools that our engineers use like SPICE models and those types of things. And then the third category is the Kilby Labs where longer term, higher risk investments are made, new materials, new markets and those types of things. So that's where the R&D has been directed. I describe R&D last year as steady and stable. And I think that even in a down market, keeping those investments stable, keeping focused on investing in our four competitive advantages is really important overall. So thank you, Toshi. Operator : We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Looks like the year-over-year declines have improved quite a bit in auto and industrial, moving from down high single digits year-over-year to down low single digits going from September to December. Of the 18 subsegments within these two end markets or by geography, where do you guys see signs of improvement? Or was it pretty broad-based? Dave Pahl : Yes. So it is the latter. It was very broad-based, which I think continues to be encouraging on that front. And again, just given the diversity of our customers as well as the diversity - the intentional diversity of our investments to have that growth be broad-based, it's good to see that that's the way the business is performing. Do you have a follow-up? Harlan Sur : Yes, absolutely. As you guys mentioned, looks like the team is now shipping to consumption. The guidance for this quarter is for a seasonal decline. But given that Q2 and Q3 are typically seasonally stronger quarters, do you guys anticipate increasing factory loadings here in the March quarter? Rafael Lizardi : We only talk about utilization and factory loadings when there's significant inflection points. And in this particular comparison, fourth to first, we don't expect a significant inflection point. So we're not talking about it. Of course, wafer load utilization is always a function of what we expect for future growth. Dave Pahl : Yes. And we'll vary those based on order patterns and as we see demand come in from customers. So thank you, Harlan. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava of Bank of Montreal. Ambrish Srivastava : I just wanted to peel back the comments on stabilization. Both these businesses, industrials and autos and specifically, industrials, I forget, but I think there's 12, 13 subsegments. So when you talk about stabilization, I'm assuming - well, you never had any channel inventory buildup. Your channel inventory was pretty normal through the cycle and your lead times never extended out. So can you just help us understand a little bit what's the source of stabilization? Is it - it can't be the channel. So it's the end customer, but then you have thousands of end customers. So what's the right way to think to get comfort that you are seeing stabilization in that business specifically? Dave Pahl : Well, Ambrish, yes, so it's reflected in the - stabilization is reflected in the order patterns, the demands that we see through consignment and actually the results themselves. So we went from third quarter where those markets were declining high single digits, 8%, 9%, some of them at 10%, to where all those markets were declining at 3%, 4%. So in those numbers, it suggests that there's a bottoming process. And even though we're holding - in consignment programs, we're holding that inventory on our balance sheet, certainly, our customers have inventory of their products and then they have inventories that are down their channels. So just as the bullwhip effect would suggest that you have a small change in end demand as that moves its way back, that magnifies. So we can see the results of that beginning to abate. Do you have a follow-on? Ambrish Srivastava : I did. Free cash flow margin. So you guys have powered through the 25%, 35% range you had given a couple of years ago. And you just had 40% in revenues down, not getting the math right, but somewhere in the high single digit, and free cash flow is down 4%. So would it be fair to assume that the targets should be moved up when we hear you talk about capital allocation in a couple of weeks from now? Rafael Lizardi : So let me take that. So thanks for the cue on that. So we do have the capital management call coming on February 4. So I expect all of you to sign up for that and join us there. And we will talk about the various objectives there. But I'll give you a preview. We're not changing those objectives and specifically, that one that you talked about, we're not. And the reason for that, yes, we just finished a 40% free cash flow as a percent of revenue, but the focus is not that percent, right? The way we maximize value for the owners of the company is growing their free cash flow per share for a long time to come. So we focus on that, and that's how we drive value. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Ambrish. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore Svanberg : First of all, coming back to the sort of recovery question, I mean, stabilization and eventual recovery. Are you starting to see backlog further out now? Or do you think it's kind of more just in time and kind of just waiting for how macro unfolds throughout the year? Dave Pahl : Yes, Tore. Now just for those that aren't as familiar with us, I'll just remind everyone or just point out that 2/3 of our revenues are supported by consignment where we actually don't carry backlog but we do get demand forecast. And most of the time, that's at least six months of demand that we can see. So - and then there's no inventory. As Ambrish was pointing out in his earlier call, there's no inventory between us and those manufacturing lines for those customers. So that's actually the strongest signal that we will get when we're looking at future demand. But certainly, the backlog pays - plays a part of that. So I'd just say that, in general, that it's consistent with the outlook that we have. And our lead times haven't changed - it hasn't really changed at all. So they have remained stable. So that allows customers to have confidence that they can get product when they need it. So do you have a follow-on? Tore Svanberg : Yes. And I apologize for ending on this topic, but there's a lot of concerns about China in-sourcing, including Analog and Embedded Processing. I was just wondering what the company's strategy is on that topic. I mean is it - is sort of life is normal? Or do you actually have a long-term strategy as it relates to that particular topic? Dave Pahl : Yes. I'll start and if Rafael wants to add anything. And certainly, as we worked through the year with the trade tensions and as that has unfolded, we've certainly heard discussions at Chinese customers, them wanting to ensure that they've got alternatives. But in the end, our customers are just very pragmatic, and they're looking for components with the highest performance, the lowest cost, the most dependable delivery. And those are all areas that we're very, very strong competitively in. With that, I'll turn it over to Rafael to wrap things up. Rafael Lizardi : All right. So let me finish with a few comments on key items for you to remember. We will remain focused on Analog and Embedded, the best products, and industrial and automotive, the best markets. Next, we will be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company. And lastly, we believe growing free cash flow per share over the long term is what will maximize value for the owners of the company. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you for joining us tonight. Good night. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded.At this time, I would like to hand things over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.Given the likelihood of a significant economic recession due to COVID-19, we are changing the format for this quarter's earnings call. In addition to Rafael Lizardi, our CFO, we will be joined by Rich Templeton, our Chairman and CEO. Rich will be covering a broader frame of how we are approaching the current environment. I will then provide a summary of first quarter and Rafael wrap up with the financial details of first quarter and our outlook for second quarter. Our prepared remarks will be longer than usual as we hope to cover a range of anticipated questions.Let me turn it over to Rich. Rich Templeton : Thanks Dave. At the highest level, to understand how we will approach a likely significant recession resulting from COVID-19, I remind you of the three ambitions that for decades have driven all decisions inside of TI. These ambitions are, first, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades, second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing and third, we will be a company that you are proud to be part of and would be proud to have as a neighbor.When we pursue these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and owners will all benefit. These guiding ambitions have served us well for decades, but they are enormously valuable in these times because they help simplify many decisions in an uncertain environment.Like many companies in the COVID-19 crisis, we have acted aggressively keeping our people safe and able to support their families. We have kept operations running to support our customers with special emphasis on our medical customers. And in the communities where we operate around the world, we have provided direct financial support and medical supplies to provide some relief. The list of action is lengthy.So starting with the economic framework. No two economic recessions are identical, but the 2008 financial crisis provides us the most recent significant recession and therefore is the best example to study and inform decisions on operating plans, revenue forecast and investment and spending plans. As a reminder, if you look back to 2008 and specifically to September 2008, all new orders turned off overnight. This led to a 26% sequential drop of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008, an additional 16% sequential decline in the first quarter of 2009 and then a rapid snapback for the next six quarters. By the second quarter of 2010 or within two years of the start of the sharp decline, revenue moved back above the level of the third quarter of 2008.With the benefit of hindsight, our customers overcorrected to the downside and we then spent a year-and-a-half chasing back up to support demand. With this in mind, we are not trying to predict this economic recession and recovery, but instead we want to ensure that we have the highest degree of optionality so that we can deal successfully with any outcome.Therefore, regarding our operating plan, looking at the patterns from pre and post 2008 and the second quarter of 2020 and quite likely the third quarter of 2020, we will be running our factories at about the level they ran in the first quarter of 2020. This will likely result in an increase in inventory during the second quarter but this will be important to support our customers during a time when they have limited ability to forecast. Our product portfolio of primarily long-lived products makes this an easy decision and maximizes our optionality.Regarding second quarter revenue guidance, Rafael will elaborate in a minute, with reduced visibility of customer demand, we have used the historical transitions that I mentioned from 2008 and adjusted for seasonality. We are not implying precision but explaining the assumptions. We are using an expanded range to account for the current uncertainty.Regarding spending and investments. First, research and development spending will be essentially unchanged as these are five to 10-year time horizon decisions. We will continue to make ongoing portfolio adjustments but these are unlikely to make meaningful changes to investment levels.On SG&A, we will maintain critical investments in new capabilities, such as strengthening ti.com because these are important times to gain ground. Where we can minimize expense, we are and we will certainly continue to do so.On capital spending, our plans are generally unchanged because the bulk of capital spending is driven by roadmap capacity needs in the 2022 to 2025 time frame. We will continue with previously announced construction plans that are underway for the next generation 300 millimeter analog wafer fab in Richardson, Texas.Lastly, regarding how we are operating in the current environment. We were fortunately prepared for the unforeseen disruptions that COVID-19 has presented. We updated our customers in late March that our lead times remain short and unchanged and that we could respond to short term demand. This is because we invested in inventory, have robust business continuity plan and invested in geographically diverse internal manufacturing footprint.Our manufacturing teams are operating throughout the world, including countries like Malaysia and the Philippines, where local restrictions have resulted in partial operations. We have adopted protocols quickly to keep our people safe and minimize any disruptions. Our team was prepared and is comfortable getting our work done remotely. We continue to actively work new design wins with customers via virtual selling processes that we instituted several years ago.On most days across TI, we are averaging a peak of 10,000 VPN connections and two million meeting minutes per day, about four times higher than normal. We all look forward to things getting back to normal, but in the meantime we are focused on execution.Let me hand things back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks Rich. I will provide some standard comments of first quarter revenue by end market and then I will add some additional insight about the quarter in light of COVID-19.First, for highlights on first quarter revenue by end market versus a year ago. Industrial increased mid single digit from a year ago quarter and it improved compared to fourth quarter. Automotive declined mid single digits and decelerated in the quarter as our customers' factory shutdowns impacted demand. Personal electronics declined mid single digits, but by sector was a mixed bag. Mobile phones declined low double digits, while by contrast PCs increased low double digits. Communications equipment declined about 50% as expected due to a comparison against a very strong first quarter 2019. Communications was up sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems increased double digits on strong data center demand.For additional insight, the first quarter ran as expected into Chinese New Year, but was slow coming out of the holiday as Chinese factories struggled to come back due to COVID-19. In early March, we saw a pickup in orders from most markets as supply chain disruptions led to increased customer concerns about being able to secure supply.This increase in demand that we experienced in March had continued into early April with the exception of automotive as manufacturers' plant closures reduced consumption. This increase in orders has steadily abated in April but returned to levels we saw in early March. The midpoint of our range assumes that this decline continues through the quarter as customers have reduced visibility to end-demand.Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone. Revenue was $3.3 billion, down 7% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion or 63% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 20 basis points.Operating expenses in the quarter were $794 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 23% of revenue. Over the last twelve months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D. Operating profit was $1.2 billion or 37% of revenue. Operating profit was down 10% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $1.2 billion, or $1.24 per share, which included a $0.10 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed.Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $851 million in the quarter. As a reminder, first quarter is typically the seasonally low point for cash flow from operations due to payout of profit sharing and bonuses. Capital expenditures were $161 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.6 billion.In the quarter, we paid $841 million in dividends and repurchased $1.6 billion of our stock for a total return to owners of $2.5 billion. In total, we have returned $6.6 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 55% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.7 billion of cash and short term investments at the end of the first quarter. In the quarter, we issued $750 million of debt with a coupon of 1.375% due in five years. This resulted in total debt of $6.6 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.81%. Since then, we have repaid $500 million of debt due in second quarter and we have no further debt due this year. We have $550 million of debt due in 2021.Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were flat to fourth quarter and days were 145. Distribution-owned inventory declined again in first quarter by about $50 million, the sixth consecutive quarter of planned reductions, as we continued the transition of our channel to have fewer distributors and bring more customers direct. We had about four weeks of distribution inventory, the lowest since third quarter of 2017. Tactically and strategically, we are very pleased. We have steadily decreased total inventory dollars while increasing the percent of inventory concentrated inside TI and therefore in fewer places. This enables us to maintain short lead times and high availability, which is critically important in an environment where end demand visibility for our customers will be limited.With a recession likely upon us, as Rich mentioned earlier, we are using the 2008 financial crisis to inform our second quarter outlook. To reflect the increased uncertainty, we have also expanded the range. For the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.61 billion to $3.19 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $1.04.Regarding our operating plan for running our factories, we expect that customers in this recession, similar to past recessions, will overcorrect in the short term as their visibility of their end demand drops. We believe it will be an important advantage to maintain consistent lead times and to offer customers high levels of product availability. Our product portfolio of mostly long-lived parts affords us to have a steady hand. Therefore, we will be running our factories in second quarter at approximately the same level we ran them in first quarter of 2020. TI inventory will likely grow during the second quarter, while distributor-owned inventory will likely drain.In closing, we continue to invest in our competitive advantages in making our business stronger. History has shown us that in times like this, is when we can make the most strategic progress.With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. And after our response, we will provide you an opportunity for a follow-up. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question today from Vivek Arya, Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, I understand visibility is low and I understand the way you are predicting Q2. But just a few weeks into Q2, have your orders or bookings played out the same way as it did during the financial crisis? Does your consignment program now provide you better visibility than last time? I am just curious what you have actually seen so far in the quarter so that we can get a better handle on the outlook that you giving? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So let me, I will start and Dave, you want to chime in on that. But as we have said in the remarks, April has, in fact, behaved very differently than 2008 in the comparison, not only April but March. March was strong coming out of Chinese New Year. As we said in the prepared remarks, we came out a little slowly but then things strengthened and into April the things have abated in the second half of April. But we think that is due to the concern that many customers have on supply disruptions.So our range and particularly the midpoint of our range implies an expectation that demand will drop as customers internalize better their end demand and frankly they are going to have very low visibility. We expect them to have very low visibly of demand. That's why the important point here is that we are keeping high optionality throughout this process, so that if things snapback, we can support that. We can support that on the other side of this.Dave? Dave Pahl : I think that's well said. Do you have a follow-on to that? Vivek Arya : Yes. Thank you. You mentioned that you are continuing to run your factory loadings in Q2 at the same level as Q1. I am curious if you can give us some color around what your modeling days of inventory to be exiting Q2? Is there a certain maximum limit to the amount of inventory or in terms of days or dollars that you willing to build before you have to start taking actions? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Thanks for that question. so Vivek, just as you framed them, I am glad you framed it that way, it is a capital allocation decision. So we are allocating capital in the form of inventory. Capital is going to go into inventory instead of going to other places and the inventory will increase, we expect very likely to increase into second quarter. But that's what gives us the optionality that I mentioned, having that inventory on hand. The key thing to remember and you know it very well, the vast majority of our products are long-lived. They are highly diverse. They sell to many, many customers. They live a long time on the shelf and the customers' product lifecycle are very long. So that inventory will not go back. So it's an option. We have a fairly low-cost upfront to have that option. Dave Pahl : That's great. Thank you Vivek. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Next up, we will hear from Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, if I go back to 2008, I think the decline was a lot quicker. But if I look Q3 2008 peak to Q1 2009 trough, revenues fell about 40%. This cycle has been longer, but if I take maybe the peak was Q3 2018 to your guide in Q2 2020, you would be down about 30%. So that suggests that maybe there is still a little more to go for following the same kind of trajectory? And I guess, also if the decline from peak to trough is longer, does that suggest that you might be thinking about the increase off the peak also being longer? Like how do we compare the two situations? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So I will take -- Rich Templeton : Stacy, this is Rich. Given the recollection of 2008, I would be careful of too much precision in where you are trying to draw that to. I do think that valid comparison and I think you know this very well from the history, is that 2008 was a reasonably, 2007 and first half of 2008 were reasonably hot semiconductor markets. It's not overheated, but pretty hot. And clearly 2019 and the first quarter 2020, we are cooler compared to the heat of 2017 and 2018. So when you try to get peak to trough, that's a little more complex. We just tried to basically look through what did we think demand was doing for a couple of years prior and that was what helped inform and help set where we put the operating plans. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. For my follow-up, I know you generally don't have tons of visibility into what true end demand is doing. But do you any way to gauge just given the amount of pull forward that we might be seeing right now whether it's gauging the pace of rush orders or anything like that? Is there anything that you can give us to try to gauge how much of the strong near term demand might be pull forward versus anything else? Dave Pahl : Yes. Stacy, as you would imagine, I don't think we have any precision on that. I think as we saw after Chinese New Year is that we saw strength. We believe that that was due to the customer concerns. It's hard to have any precision around what percentage of that was due to that concern with any degree of accuracy.But, yes, Rafael, you want to add to that? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. I agree. The only thing I would add is that we know, is the channel is clean, the district channel, because as we said, we are four weeks, we drained about $50 million on the channel and we plan to continue draining for the next three quarters or so about another $200 million or so plain drain as we convert more and more customers to go in direct. So the channel, we know is clean and will continue to be clean. But as Dave alluded to, we really don't know the end customers when they pull, how much of that is true end demand versus stocking up for potential disruption. Dave Pahl : Yes. And I might add too that, as you know Stacy, 65%, 70% of our revenue is on consignment. So we are not turning backlog but we see plans that are in our customer' factories. But as they have reduced visibility, all those plans are not updated. So they are being updated slowly, as they are deciding what to build in those factories. So those updated plans are rolling through and that's what's creating the uncertainty as you would imagine.Okay. Thank you Stacy. And we will go to the next caller please. Operator : Next up from Morgan Stanley is Craig Hettenbach. Craig Hettenbach : Yes. Thank you. I appreciate the color on the OpEx side of things. Any additional thoughts around just kind of variable compensation? And as revenue comes, some mitigation in terms of EPS impact over the next couple of quarters? Rafael Lizardi : Sure. So as we said in the prepared remarks, in general, OpEx will be relatively unchanged. So R&D, those are long term investment. SG&A, we also have some investment areas there with ti.com. In other places, we frankly run the company pretty tightly to begin with but wherever we can tighten them more, we do.On your specific question on variable compensation. That tends to be a profit-sharing and bonus. Profit sharing moves according to a formula, so it's very formulaic. So depending on what happens, that adjusts. And bonuses is determined by the Board depending on routing performance on one to three years on several metrics. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-on, Craig? Craig Hettenbach : I do. Thanks. And understanding the different cadence by geography in terms of China was weak, then came back and Europe and North America maybe weaker now. But would just love to get your thoughts just for Q2 how you are expecting kind of things within your guidance from a geographic perspective? Dave Pahl : Yes. I always give caution when asked about geographical revenue. Sometimes we can see distinct patterns, but where we ship our product is rarely where it's actually consumed, as you know. So we ship a product that ends up in a phone built in China, it may end up but in Europe. So if there was something distinct in our guidance that was impacted by geography, we would share that. And we don't have anything specific to share with that right now.But thank you Craig. And we will go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question is Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Hi guys. Thanks for all these additional details, especially with Rich on the line. Maybe one for Rich. In your comments earlier, you said you wanted to use 2008 as a template and that is about as fair a template as I could imagine as well. You also laid out about how the pattern was a steep fall, then a steep rise back. Given that you are behaving, your actions are very different this time where you are keeping utilization flat, et cetera, is that because you view this cycle as being any different, short duration matching the same one as a decade ago? Or is it simply just the optionality side of the equation at the end of the day that you are trying to maintain? Dave Pahl : Let me have Rafael. Rich Templeton : Ross, just to help on that, I think Rafael covered this in some ways. If you think back to 2008 and you know and a bunch of folks know, we were very much different. We had a large wireless business. We had portfolio re-profiling we had to do. We have had a high percentage of our product that wasn't exactly custom, but it behaved a lot like custom. So building inventory was a much more difficult game. And the beauty about where we are today is, as Rafael pointed out, is that a high percentage of the portfolio is long-lived products. We have got our R&D and our resources well deployed in the areas that we want to be long term. And that's what really puts us in the wonderful position where the cost to have maximum optionality is actually pretty low on our particular case in 2020 versus where it was back in October 2008. Ross Seymore : Okay. Thank you for that. And I guess as my follow-up, just switching over to the cash return side of the equation. It looks like you guys had pretty much the second biggest buyback in a single quarter you have had in a decade. Can you just remind us on how you guys are thinking about the ability to return cash? I know your long term policy of returning 100% of your free cash flow and it's not just dictated by any single quarter. I appreciate that as well. But this was significantly above what you guys generated in a single quarter and maybe even in a couple of quarters of free cash flow. So just talk about how much leverage you are willing to put on the balance sheet to take advantage opportunistically of a pullback in your stock when it's below what I guess you view to be your intrinsic value? Rafael Lizardi : Sure. So let me first, you alluded to it but let me just remind everybody on the call, that our objective when it comes to cash return is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. We do that through buybacks and dividends. So for example, on a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $5.6 billion of free cash and we returned $6.6 billion. So obviously all free cash flow there have been returned.And then you mentioned debt and we have debt on their balance sheet as we said on the call, $6.6 billion, we finished. On a net basis, it is $1.8 billion because we have $4.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet. But we use debt to increase the rates of return with some leverage when it makes sense. So that's how we view the returns and the debt for many, many years, as we have talked about on capital management. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you Ross. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Next up is John Pitzer, Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave, I just want to go back to your comments in your prepared remarks about booking swelling as we have been coming to the end of April. Was there any end market distinction you can talk about? And I am particularly interested in kind of understanding how auto and industrial is behaving at the beginning this pandemic versus maybe things like PC, data center and comms? Dave Pahl : Yes. John, I would say that when we looked at the last quarter, it was very distinct but we saw strength. We saw strength in PCs. We saw strength in data center. We saw a distinct slowing in auto as we as we talked about. I would say that the relative strengths in orders that we saw in the quarter that happened in March and continued into April was broad-based generally and was across the board with the exception of auto. And then the slowing, I would say that it is also broad-based.You have a follow-on? John Pitzer : Yes. Just as my follow-on, returning to Ross' question about capital allocation and return. Rich, since you are on the call, you guys have always been good at sort of zagging what everybody else is zigging and you have got a longer duration out there. I am kind of curious about how you are viewing the current environment relative to M&A? And is that sort of an arrow in your strategic quiver as we go through the next couple of quarters, much clear then when you were in recession? Rich Templeton : John, if you think about it and you can even, you have watched us for a long time. You can go back to 2008 and then look at what we did through 2009, 2010, 2011 and such. And clearly if you think about capital allocation, the things that I stepped through, keeping on the right R&D investments, keeping out the right capital expenditures, making the right capability investments on things like ti.com, that's where you get just very excited about. We will be getting stronger during this period and those strengths will help us even as the secular trends of more semiconductors in your life are growing.To the degree that we have an opportunity to buy used equipment or used factories or potentially M&A, as with anything on capital allocation. I think that one just goes down to the it depends type comment, meaning it would have to be probably a more prolonged downturn. If you think about what the mood was in 2009, 2010 and 2011, that mood had to be there for a while before opportunities became available. But we are certainly, we try to just be wise over the long term. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you John. We will go to the next caller, please. Operator : And we will go to Chris Danley, Citigroup. Chris Danley : Hi. Thanks guys. And Rich, thanks for making the cameo. My first question. Rich, do you think or do you anticipate any longer term structural changes in the business, either in terms of end markets or anything you are looking at as a result of this pandemic? Rich Templeton : Chris, I think it's early. I think I know your world tries to get ahead on trying to guess what will happen, I, in general, think that the secular trends that we have seen with semiconductors and more semiconductors coming into people's lives, are going to continue, okay. And I think somewhat as John alluded to in his question, it's obvious in the near term, but server sales and PCs are going to do well as working from home continues. But I just think longer term you look at industrial products, industrial equipment and even automotive, even though on the near term people will see SAAR numbers come down. The secular trend on semiconductor growth inside of automotive is going to make it a great market to be in for the long term.So no, I don't think from that point there will be a big structural change. I do think we have got a great advantage of having structural channel advantage. So the changes that we have been working towards for a number of years of building closer, direct relationship with customers, things that you now see playing out with a higher and higher percentage of inventory being in our hands to where we can be more efficient, that's going to be a fantastic trend and TI is well prepared to take advantage of that with our breadth of channel reach through the industry. Chris Danley : Thanks. So I can follow-up? Dave Pahl : Yes. Sure. Go for it, Chris. Chris Danley : Okay. Thanks. And then Rich, to the extent you can, if you could give us any insight into what the customer conversations are like? What are they asking? What are their big concerns? And I guess at the root of it, you guys talked about and I thought about this, why aren't we seeing this sort of fall off in orders yet? Has everybody just kind of frozen in place out there? Why is that happening? Rich Templeton : Chris, I think if you and Dave, I thought was very direct with what he described as we saw orders rise, starting to peak at first, second week of March. You saw them rise up. You have seen them start trend down. They are still at that level we saw approximately ending February and in early March. I think that's starting to filter through. For us, especially, Dave will have the number where we are 60%, 70% consignment. It takes a while for those consignment feeds to really get updated because companies have got to start getting better numbers on that front. So I think customers are just still processing through what their customers are telling them and we will see that play through. It's why we have made the assumption that May would be down from the April and June down versus April as well for the range. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you Chris. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Next up is Tore Svanberg, Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. And I appreciate the wide range of the guidance in this environment. But can you maybe elaborate a little bit on what the assumptions are sort of at the low end and at the high end of the range? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So I will give you my take. Frankly there is no science on that. As we talked about earlier, we are using 2008 as the model for that. Again, it doesn't imply precision, not even similarity. It's just that it's the most recent exogenous event that we can use. So we are using that. And the midpoint is the closest thing to that adjusted for seasonality. What you normally would see on our first, second quarter transition, now you are seeing a negative 13% at that midpoint. But the entire range and the other reason we widened or the reason we widened the range is to reflect the great level of uncertainty that we have going on.As Rich mentioned, many customers, right now they are still processing what's happening and we have actually heard some of them haven't been able to update their feeds to us, right. So they have got to go through all that process. And so that's embedded in that wide range. The biggest point I want to make and we made it a couple of times already is the optionality that we are going to get based on how we are running the factories, right.So this thing can go multiple ways for second quarter and third quarter and beyond. But we have just great optionality the way we are running the business, both strategically, the type of parts we build and the end product and so forth. But tactically, the way we are running the factories and inventory in second quarter. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Tore? Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you Dave. The other question goes back to what you just mentioned there. So I am sure your customers are probably thinking about this too and maybe they are perhaps building some inventory too to be able to respond to an eventual demand. If that should be the case, how long would you be willing to have this optionality or perhaps run the inventories a little bit longer than normal? Rafael Lizardi : You know, it's going to depend on a number of factors that today we don't know, right. And I think we and the world and the industry will learn over the coming weeks and months and then we will adjust an unnecessary. I think the advantage we have with the way we are set up strategically, with the type of parts we build and the type of customers we have and the type of end markets is that we can afford to have this optionality, right. These parts are not going to go bad. It is very different in a custom part centric world in personal electronics type of centric world. That's not the case with the way we structured in the company. So we have great optionality to go through this beyond second quarter. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you Tore. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : And next from BMO is Ambrish Srivastava. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you. Rich, good to hear your voice. I am sure that nobody really wanted to hear you at this kind of a forum. I had a question back on capital allocation and going back to the 2008, 2009 template or playbook. You raised the dividend in the fourth quarter, back then it was a small person, but it was on a percentage basis was pretty meaningful. So as we compare where we are heading now versus I am sure nobody had any idea what next quarter was going to be, what's the right way to think about capital allocation? Based on the comments you and Dave and Rafael are making, it sounds like no change in 100% free cash flow back, divvy plus buyback, no change to that. So just kind of help us understand the thinking or scenarios that you are playing out that you are thinking through which might lead to a near term modification on that, Rich? And then I have a follow-up. Rich Templeton : Yes. So I will set up and I will let Rafael cover it. The answer is, no change, Ambrish, because we really have tried to have a very thoughtful long term plan. But I think it's helpful for Rafael to summarize some of those plans. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So just to comment and Ambrish, as you said and Rich just confirmed that, yes, there is change in the way we think of our capital management and our long term objectives. So as I said earlier, cash return, return all free cash flow. On dividend specifically, as you alluded to, the objective is provide a sustainable and growing dividend to appeal to a broader set of owners. And as a reminder, on a trailing 12-month basis, our dividend was a 55% of our free cash flow now. Of course, as a backwards-looking metric, I understand that. But it's great place to start. Frankly, few companies are at that level in our industry and in the S&P 500. So it's a great place to start. But that objective of providing a sustainable and growing dividend, it has been and continues to be very important for us. Dave Pahl : Follow-on, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes, I did and this is more to do, I think Chris asked a good question on structural changes. Given that we are working from home, at least those of us who can afford to work from home, how is it impacting the design activity that TI engages in, in multiple geos, multiple customers, so many end markets? What's the right way to think about the changes that you are seeing there? And odes it portend poorly for when we ultimately get to a more \"normal world\"? Rich Templeton : Ambrish, it's why we included in my remarks comments about how we are operating and it's one of these deals produced an update for internal. And basically, I had a bunch of people telling me, gosh, we got lucky on some things. And I explained, there is this great quote that, luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. And we put in place this mass-market selling, really virtual selling techniques starting three years ago. It's an instituted standard process. Our sales teams work at applications, people work at comfortable with customers. And so it's almost been like nothing has changed in terms of where we spend our time working between ourselves and the customers. They all want to do it on the phone anyhow. Our products group connecting in on that.So the readiness that we had to operate in this world is actually enormously high. Having ti.com more capable to support customers' decisions to be able to support online commerce as we are bringing more customers direct, the comfort of our product groups, design engineers and people to work collaboratively because we have always had to do that is really very unchanged. I do think people are working more hours just because the days and hours tend to blend into one another, as I am sure everybody on this call is experiencing. But it's very impressive to watch the team performing and watching what it's getting done. We are even at that point where all the set of customer visits even next week where those customer visits will be virtual as well. So we are just well into the way of operating this way. Rafael Lizardi : I just want to comment on a slightly different topic, but related in the spirit of preparation meeting opportunity. I just want to highlight and we talked about it during the prepared remarks, but we were prepared for the unforeseen disruptions with a combination of our inventory strategy, our business continuity program and our geographically diverse manufacturing footprint, which of course is part of our one of our competitive advantages of manufacturing and technology. So we have in all of those together, we were able and continue to be able to provide our customers with short lead times and inventory availability in this time when they need it most, not now and the coming of quarters when their visibility will be impaired. Dave Pahl : Yes. And I would say that we have had customers actually contact us and they are rather surprised that our lead times are stable and they can get the product that they need. So they are very happy with that.So thank you, Ambrish. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : And next is Harlan Sur, JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and appreciate the additional commentary and Rich being on the call today. I know you guys don't like to talk about sort of specific geographies. But fact of the matter is, China is coming out of this pandemic and starting to open up their economy and throwing quite a bit of stimulus at it. Are you seeing this being reflected in your order rates or consignment forecast for your domestic China customers? And roughly what percentage of your business today comes from domestic China consumption? Dave Pahl : Yes. I will start and please chime in, Rafael, if you would like. So again I will give the numbers of products of where we actually ship the product but always offer the caution that it's where the box ships from. So we have got 50% of our product ships into China. But again, like you know, cellular phones as an example may be built there, may be designed in California and end up in Europe as an example. And yes, we are seeing those factories coming back online as we talked about in our prepared remarks. Yet, I think the uncertainty is how much demand will actually be there as those factories come back online. And I think that that's what's creating that uncertainty.So do you have follow-on? Harlan Sur : Yes. Thank you for that. So IHS in its most recent forecast is calling for global little vehicle production to drop almost 20% this year. This is twice the year-over-year drop as experienced in the 2008, 2009 financial crisis. Outside maybe just the near term inventory correction to kind of normalize to the lower production trends, how is the TI team thinking about your content growth in auto to potentially partially offset significant decline in production this year? Dave Pahl : Yes. I think Harlan, I will make a couple of comments and Rich, if you want to jump in afterwards, feel free to. And I think that what's important for us is just the longer term opportunity in automotive remains unchanged. And we continue to invest in five different sectors inside of automotive. There will be more content per vehicle, as you know, Harlan, as you are pointing to. We will respond tactically to those changes in demand and we know how to do that and take care that operationally. That's not something that we will be able to control, but we will keep our investments steady and be prepared to support that growing opportunity as it arrives.So Rich, you have anything to add to that? Rich Templeton : Yes. I would just, Harlan, amplify as I suggested earlier that the secular growth theme that are embedded in things like automotive or embedded in industrial are alive and well, okay. They are going to be with us. They are not going to offset a 20% SAAR drop in any one year and you know that. I think everybody does. But when it comes to making investments, as Dave said very well, you have got to be looking five and six years out. And we think automotive will continue to be a great average upper of our long term growth and outperformance. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you Harlan. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : And up next is Toshiya Hari, Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the question. I just had one, probably for Rich. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape that you are seeing today, both in embedded processing as well as analog? You guys have been a pretty consistent share gainer over the past five, 10, 15 years. I wanted to get your thoughts on share growth potential going forward. Obviously, you guys are going through this recession which all else equal, I would think would be positive for industry leaders like yourself. You are also going through the go-to-market strategy change. You have also got the trade tensions between the U.S. and China. So we think about those three items, if you can talk to your confidence level around share growth over the next, call it, three to five years, that would be helpful. Thank you. Rich Templeton : Yes. Toshi, I think you have almost answered the question. I think you described a couple of secular tailwinds if we do our job well where the secular headwind depending on trade tensions, but even there, if we do our job well, I think we can mitigate some of that. I think you also and I am sure Dave is smiling, you got to the right context, which is you have got to look at this over two, three and four years. I think we remind everybody all the time. And so you look at the share we gained going into and then the position we were coming out of 2009 downturn and we gained momentum in that and that certainly what our plans are right now. And that is about both analog and embedded. And it's about the markets that we focus on. It's the customers, the products, the technology, the capability like ti.com that we put in place. And it's where all our energy is going on a weekly and daily basis to get better at that. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you Toshiya. We will go to next caller please. Operator : Next up is Timothy Arcuri, UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. I have two. I guess the first one, Rich, is another sort of another how to think about how those things evolve, I guess, move around. And I [indiscernible] -- Dave Pahl : Hello? Hi Tim? Timothy Arcuri : Yes. Dave Pahl : Yes. we are having trouble hearing you. Could you start over please? Timothy Arcuri : Sure. Okay. So the first question really is around how the cycle evolves and how to think about it? And I guess I understand that the magnitude, the peak to trough magnitude is hard to look back at 2008 and to sort of look at that. But it seems like the near term supply chain boost that or the concerns that customers have about that, that's boosting near term demand, it seems like for you that effect is sort of beginning to wane maybe a little earlier than others because of your consignment model. So frankly, you are seeing it first and I wonder if you agree with that that it relates to the consignment model? And I guess the question is, does that agree that or does that argue that you would maybe see it out the other side first as well? Dave Pahl : Yes. Tim, so I don't know, so first of all, we haven't seen what others have reported yet or what they have seen some. So it's probably too early to do that. And we have had theories of us seeing it early and seeing it late, just rather not weigh in on that debate and just report the facts that we have and let others debate it, right.We do believe that by pulling and controlling that inventory, we will get much cleaner signals. But as we talked about before, our customers right now, they are not sure what their demand is going to look like. And so what they are telling us hasn't been updated yet. So even what they are telling us isn't completely clear. So it's going to take a little bit of time before all that stuff is updated.So you have a follow-on? Timothy Arcuri : I do, yes. For Rafael. So I guess on inventory. So if I assume that it's sort of flat to up in dollar terms, obviously your days are going to go way up in June, maybe they are 170 or 180 days like that and possibly they are up again in September. I guess I was just wondering like, can you give us some sense of what the pain point is where you might cut utilization? Is it an inventory dollar thing? Is it days thing? Or is it sort of just duration of recovery thing? Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Good question. First, let me step back and remind you that for us, the objective of inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence while we improve manufacturing asset utilization. The target of 115 to 145, frankly is kind of incidental, right. It's just a calculation. At the end of the day, this is a capital allocation decision. We are going to -- we have $2.0 billion-some of inventory. That's real money that's on the balance sheet that if wasn't there, it would be back in the owners bucket.So we are very thoughtful in how we are going to, how we make those decisions to put potentially more inventory on that balance sheet, right. That's less cash that we have. But we just think it is going to give us great optionality throughout this thing, right. And you know, like any decision when it comes to capital management, it's going to depend, right. So that's the decision we are making now. We have to see how thing develop in the coming months and based on that, we will adjust.The important thing, the inventory lasts a long time. This is inventory that is scrap level. This inventory is very, very low. So the others, well, there's a working capital and an opportunity cost to it, but it is very low given that is highly unlikely that it is going to be scrap. And it gives us just tremendous optionality on the other side. Rich Templeton : Okay. Just to follow-up Rafael and Tim, Rafael said this before, so it's just me repeating his comments. The other thing to keep in mind and you spelled this out is, well, our inventory would be growing in second quarter. We will drain yet again distribution inventory. So we have just got to keep these multiple variables in mind and it just keeps putting us in a better and better position when we are doing that. So our balance sheet may show higher inventory but we love the fact that that channel inventory will be getting leaner and leaner and the inventory will be in one place where we can get the most effective use out of it. Rafael Lizardi : I will go ahead and add, when you and all the investors listening on the call, when you compare us to most or maybe all of our competitors, our balance sheet is very different in that regard because we have many consignment arrangement. Well, 65%, two-thirds of our revenue goes through consignment whether it's through distribution or directly with the end customer. So that puts upwards pressure on that inventory level that we have. We also have our own manufacturing too, including assembly test operation, whereas to a very high degree, about 80% of our output goes through our fabs and maybe 60% or 70% through our assembly test operation. So that's also very different than our competitors. So that's why it's not apples-to-apples when you compare our inventory levels to those of our competitors. But let me make the point out though that we think owning and controlling that inventory is a strategic asset. So we are very pleased we are having those consignment arrangement. Clearly, very pleased with owning our own manufacturing and what that has enabled us to do any time, but particularly in times of disruption like what we just experienced and continue to experience where it just really puts us in a much better position to support our customers. Dave Pahl : Right. Okay, I think we have time for one last caller. Operator : And we will go to Mark Lipacis, Jefferies. Mark Lipacis : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I had one. Our own fieldwork in the supply chain downstream from you guys indicate that inventories are indeed like normal, if not lean levels and as the virus spreads around the world to places like Malaysia and Philippines, that the shortages of components, understanding that your inventories are at the high end of the range and not hearing anything about TI shortages. But basically supply is being disruptive and there is a reticence to give up any excess inventories downstream for you. I am wondering if you could describe what you are seeing on your own supplier base that you want to run your factory at consistent levels here. Are you seeing any of these supply chain disruptions that your customers are seeing at other components? Are you seeing that? And how are you managing that? And there is a risk that you are not going to be able to run your capacities consistently because of your own supply disruptions? That's all I had. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Not a problem. The short answer to that is, we are not seeing anything worth mentioning on this call. Little things here and there. But nothing that we can not manage. Remember, I referred to our business continuity program and we have been -- in this call, we have been mainly about inventory, finished goods inventory that we carry. But that also applies on multiple other angles. So for example, we also carry raw material inventory buffer. We have many dual and triple and quadruple sourcing of key raw materials. And we also have as I have talked about earlier geographically diverse manufacturing footprint in Malaysia, in the Philippines, in Taiwan, in Mexico, in China. So that just really puts us in a very good position. It also gives us leverage to work with the suppliers which by the way, we pay them in 30 days. We make that as part of our thinking to be fair to those suppliers and we don't play games on that. So that's also from a long term relationship standpoint, I think we are in very good shape with all of those suppliers. Dave Pahl : Would you like to wrap this up? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So let me just wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously. History has shown us that it is times like this when we can make the most strategic progress. We will continue to invest in and strengthen our four competitive advantages which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will also continue to pursue the three ambitions rich mentioned. We will act like owners who will on the company for decades. We will adapt in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would be proud to have as a neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners will all benefit. It is these ambitions that will guide our decisions in the weeks and months ahead as we navigate these uncertain times. Our best to you and your family. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Thank you and good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today and we will provide the following updates. First, I will start with a reminder of the framework we described during that April earnings call for how we will navigate the COVID-19 economy. Next, I will provide insight into second quarter revenue results with more details than usual by end-market including sequential performance since it's more informative at this time. And lastly, Rafael will cover financial results, some insight into one-time items, and our guidance for the third quarter. During the April call, we explained that we will use the three ambitions to drive our decisions as they are particularly helpful in uncertain times like we face with COVID-19. For decades, these ambitions have driven all decisions inside TI. They are to act like owners who will own the company for decades. Secondly, to adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And third, to be a company that you are proud to be a part of and would be proud to have as a neighbor. When we pursue these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities, and owners will all benefit. While second quarter did not experience the depth of the decline we saw in the 2008 financial crisis, nonetheless we remain cautious on how the economy might behave over the next few years. As a reminder, in April we provided a broader framework to help you understand how we will operate through this environment. First, we will maintain high optionality with our operating plan so we can support customers, particularly during a time when their ability to forecast will be limited. Next, we will maintain investments in R&D and in new capabilities like those for ti.com, since they are five to 10 year time horizon decisions and critical to building TI stronger. And finally, we will invest to ensure long-term manufacturing capacity, particularly for the 2022 to 2025 timeframe. Making decisions with our ambitions in mind will continue to serve us well, and that coupled with the framework I just mentioned should help you understand our actions. We are particularly pleased with our decision to maintain an operating plan that allowed us to maximize our optionality. During the second quarter, we were able to respond to unforecasted demand. We will continue to maintain this posture in the third quarter. Moving on, I will now provide some insight into our second quarter revenue. There are several key points to summarize what we are seeing in the market. First, overall the weakness was primarily from the automotive market. Automotive was down about 40% sequentially and down over 40% compared to a year ago. To help appreciate this impact, excluding automotive, TI was up 8% sequentially and down 3% versus a year ago. The automotive market appears to have bottomed in May as North American and European assembly plants resumed operations. Next, the industrial market was up about 2% sequentially and also up 2% from a year ago. There are end-markets that are weak and others that are understandably strong, like medical. We do believe that some customers are trying to maintain strong inventory positions to limit exposure to any supply chain disruptions. Personal electronics was up over 20% sequentially and up about 10% compared to a year ago. This can best be explained by work from home trends and TI being in a position to support unforecasted demand in the second quarter. Next, communications equipment was up 20% sequentially, but down 15% compared to a year ago. Within this market, it's important to note that analog achieved sequential and year-over-year growth, while embedded was down in both comparisons following our planned decline in this portion of the business. Enterprise systems was up sequentially and year-over-year. This strength, similar to personal electronics, is best explained by work from home trend and TI being positioned to support unforecasted demand. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Second quarter revenue was $3.2 billion, down 12% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion or 64% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue and gross profit margin was even. Operating expenses in the quarter were $780 million, down 4% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 23% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D. Operating profit was $1.2 billion in the quarter, or 38% of revenue. Operating profit was down 18% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.4 billion, or $1.48 per share, which included a $0.33 benefit primarily for tax-related items that were not in our prior outlook. The benefit included $0.02 of restructuring charges to strengthen our embedded business by focusing investments on the best opportunities for long term growth. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $130 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.7 billion. In the quarter, we paid $823 million in dividends and repurchased $882 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.7 billion. In total, we have returned $6.7 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 56% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we issued $750 million of debt with a coupon of 1.75% due in 10 years. This resulted in total debt of $6.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. We have repaid $500 million of debt due in second quarter, and we have no further debt due this year. We have $550 million of debt due in 2021. Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were up $133 million from first quarter, and days were 166, about as expected. Distribution-owned inventory declined again in second quarter by about $150 million, the seventh consecutive quarter of planned reductions as we continued the transition to have fewer distributors and bring more customers direct. Tactically and strategically, we are pleased. We have held total inventory dollars steady, while increasing the percent of inventory held inside TI and therefore in fewer places. This enables us to continue to maintain short lead times and high availability to meet unforecasted customer demand. For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.26 billion to $3.54 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.34. Regarding our factory operating plan, as we have stated, we will maintain high optionality so we can continue to support customers' demand, particularly during a time when their ability to forecast may continue to be limited. We have informed our customers that lead times on our products remain short and more than 40,000 products are available for immediate shipment on TI.com. Short lead times and high availability are important capabilities that allow us to continue to support customers' near term and unforecasted demand. Our product portfolio of mostly long-lived parts affords us to have a steady hand and therefore, we will take a similar approach to our factory operating plan again in third quarter. In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger. History has shown us that it is in times like these when we can make the most strategic progress. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question I have, you still mentioned that you think some of your industrial customers are trying to build, I guess, inventories and making sure that their own position is still strong. But if your lead times are short and you are building, you have 40,000 products that are ready to ship, why would any of your customers actually have any need to pre-buy anything? And if so, do you think what you are seeing right now is maybe just more indicative of what the actual end demand state might look like? Like how do we square that circle? Dave Pahl : Yes. Stacy, it's a good question. I think you know, as we have talked about last quarter, we saw some unusual order patterns. As we talked about revenue running up really strong into March and things abating, they certainly didn't abate as we thought that they would. We saw supply constraints across the industry, and sometimes as customers' orders, as they look at building inventory, our visibility ends at their dock when we ship them products. So, they may decide to build some finished good inventory, so we don't have visibility into that. So that's really not a number that we can look into a system to provide us that. It's really just more instinct and experience and also just talking to our field teams and getting input from that standpoint. So, when we look at the numbers, that's what it is telling us. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Stacy, just to add to that, a few comments. One, out of our 100,000 or so customers, I will guess 70,000 to 80,000 of those are in industrial., right. So, it's frankly just difficult to draw conclusions with such a huge number of customers that have different idiosyncrasies in the way they behave. The other thing I would tell you is that, if I am a purchasing manager at one of these customers, and I am ordering 200 different parts for a board, are they really going to treat certain suppliers a little differently than others, if they decided to build inventory to stock up and feel safer, probably not, right. So, that's another dynamic that may be you should take into account. Dave Pahl : And not in all cases. Rafael Lizardi : Right. Dave Pahl : Not in all cases. So, there is probably some of that and that's just the caution that that would provide. You have a follow-up, Stacey? Stacy Rasgon : Yes. I guess just to follow-up on that a little bit. So, if I look at kind of the trajectory you have had over the last few quarters, Q1 you are above seasonal; Q2, ex-auto you were above seasonal; your Q3 guide is kind of at the low end of seasonal, but kind of roughly. I mean, so far like at least outside of auto, it doesn't seem like the pandemic is having any real impact on you guys at all. I just find it a little surprising, what are you hearing from your customers, if anything, as to that effect in terms of what they are seeing and the impact that the pandemic is having on the supply chain? Because as far as I can tell, it's not having much impact on you at all, I guess, which is good. Dave Pahl : Well, I will remind you that the number we have turned in was down 12%, right. Stacy Rasgon : Yes. But it was up 8%, ex-auto, right? Dave Pahl : Correct. Yes. And unfortunately, we have to report the numbers with auto in. So well, that is the reality, and auto was down 40%. So, you know, that is real. And the auto manufacturers closed down because of COVID. So, I wouldn\u2019t quite go so far to say that it didn't have an impact. And you know, if you look inside of that, you saw strength in some areas like the work from home trends, like PCs and tablets and servers from the inside of enterprise, right. So, we are seeing some strength that's due to that which is also driving that. So there is some things that are moving around that we saw. And the other thing that if you look longer term, as we entered the year, as you know, I think we described back in January that we were seeing signs of stabilization with the fourth quarter results as we had worked our way through the bottom of the cycle. We are starting to see those signs of stabilization. Now with those signs of stabilization, again, we just turned in a down 12% overall. So, those are the results and we do have to report the numbers all in but I think it is important, we wanted to give the color of auto because that was the driver of the weakness from the year ago. So, thanks Stacy. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We will hear now from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to actually pick up from that point on automotive. I am curious, Rafael or Dave, what you are expecting your automotive business to do in Q3? Because when I look at your auto sales, I think you mentioned down over 40%. They are kind of in line with units. And I know just picking on one quarter is not representative of the trend, but some of your auto peers said they benefited from content growth and so forth. So, my question is, what do you think about just the broader automotive market heading into Q3? And do you think you can start to get back to a point where you get some content growth on top of whatever unit recovery that we might see? Dave Pahl : Yes. Vivek, I think that's a great clarification. So obviously, what we are reporting is just our shipments. When factories close, they stop taking product. You know that for our revenues overall, a large portion of our revenues overall are on consignment. So, there is not inventory sitting between us and those manufacturing lines. In general, I describe the automotive market as being a more mature supply chain. So, those supply chains will react faster than, let's say an industrial supply chain would perhaps. And so, when those factories open back on, they begin to pull those units. So, we won't try to predict what the overall market is going to do. We can measure when customers are pulling that demand. Our confidence in content growth, three and five years from now in automobiles remains very high, but just try to draw the dots of a cyclical recovery, we just won't spend time trying to do that. So do you have follow-on? Vivek Arya : Yes. Thanks Dave. So on the factory plan, I recall, Rafael, you mentioned that you expect your factory plans in Q3 to be the same as Q2 and we saw inventory go up in Q2. What do you think your inventory levels will do in Q3? And what I am trying to do is try to align, your Q3 guidance seems to be seasonal, as was asked before, even the range of outlook seems to be very in line with normal guidance, but your commentary seems to be more conservative, certainly visibility on the macro side seems to be a little more difficult. So I am just trying to get a better sense for what does your plan for production in Q3 tell us about your visibility on to your end customers and the level of demand? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Sure. First, a couple of things. First, the environment continues to be uncertain. So I want to make sure that's clear. We remain cautious how this economy will behave for the next several years, okay. So that is very important. That is part of the way we are looking at this. At the same time, we want to keep our optionality, maximize our optionality. And what that means is, be able to meet unforecasted demand from our customers like we just did in second quarter and we plan to continue that in third quarter and beyond. The reason we can do that, strategically we are just very well positioned. The parts that we sell tends to be the majority of them catalog parts that sell to many, many customers that last a long, long time. So if we end up building inventory, that inventory is not going to go bad. We don't have to scrap it. So that plays very well in our favor. Essentially, it's a very symmetrical bet that we are making where the upside is really high, the downside is limited. So we are going to continue operating that way. Dave Pahl : That's great. Thank you Vivek. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We will hear now from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the execution. I just wanted to go back to performance or performance by segment. Obviously in Q2, it was a significant beat in terms of revenue. And Dave, thanks very much for giving color on a sequential basis and a year-over-year basis. But relative to what you are thinking internally, where did the beat come from? Was it broad-based or was it focused in one or two businesses? Dave Pahl : Well, I think that in general, if you look at the areas of strength that we had, certainly in areas that were driven by the work from home, the PCs, tablets, the servers, those were areas that we saw strength. Automotive, obviously, when things shut down, they shut down. And that had turned off pretty much like a light switch as the numbers would show. And I think that inside of industrial, you have got the numbers of down or the 2% or so from a transition standpoint. So yes, definitely the strength that we saw we had in the work from home areas. You have a follow-on? Toshiya Hari : I do. As you guys know, M&A is clearly topical in the group right now and Rafael, I was just hoping you can remind us what's sort of the criteria is when it comes to M&A for you guys at TI? And sort of a two-part question. Is it fair to say that your posture is a little bit more conservative or cautious, given the current macro and geopolitical backup as well as where evaluations lie? Or is it pretty much business as usual for you guys on the M&A front? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. That's a good question and it's interesting the way you framed it. So let me maybe first remind everybody our framework. Any acquisition that we consider needs to meet two criteria. First, it needs to be a good strategic fit. So that an analog company with catalog parts, differentiated parts that then go into auto and industrial, because that's where we focus as where the content growth is happening and that would align well with our strategy. But the next piece is that price needs to make sense. And that is after, once you make the purchase, in three, four, five years, are you meeting the cost of capital, are you beating the cost of capital. And think of it on a cash on cash standpoint. Invest $100 and my cost of capital is 10%, when am I going to get $10 after tax on that investment. Can I beat that $10 and get $15 or $20 over time? So that is our criteria. That's the one we have had for many years and we continue to have it. On your second part of your question, frankly in an environment like we are going through, this is a great time to make the most of opportunities. So we are not conservative. We are following the same framework that we have followed. And based on that framework, we are evaluating M&A opportunities, but more importantly we are continuing to invest internally. We are making our competitive advantages stronger. We continue to invest in R&D. We haven't scaled back that at all. We continue to invest in things like ti.com and our retail market channels. And of course our manufacturing and technology, where we broke ground on the new facility, the new, the second, RFAB in Richardson and we are going to investing to have that building ready over the next 18 to 24 months. So we continue to do that to strengthen the company and now is a great time to do it. We are very well positioned from a balance sheet standpoint, from a P&L, free cash flow standpoint, a lot better than our competitors. So it's a good time to take advantage of that. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you Toshiya. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We will hear from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Ross Seymore : Hi guys. Thanks a lot for letting me ask a question and congrats on the strong results. I wanted to go into the source of the upside that Dave and Rafael, you guys talked about, the work from home side, I think everybody understands why that was better. But the big question that's still outstanding to me is the sustainability of that. So can you just talk about that the upside surprise, do you think, is sustainable? I know you are not guiding by end markets. You never do. But how do you envision the second half of the year in those same areas that upsided? Dave Pahl : Yes. Ross, I think that when we look at our business longer term, we look at where we are investing for growth. Industrial and automotive is where the investments go, especially industrial. That's where we expect growth to be, you know, when we look at three and five and 10 year growth, perhaps for next couple of decades. So we believe that growth is very sustainable and that's really where we are focused. I will say that some of the growth that we are seeing is due because of the optionality that Rafael talked about how. We have recently updated our customers. We got 40,000 products that we have immediate availability on today. So if that demand is the sustainable in the second half, we have got the products available to ship into any of our markets overall in the short term. But our long term prospects, I think, are really what's more important. Do you have a follow-on? Ross Seymore : I do. Thanks for that answer. I want to switch over to the two product segments, the two main ones, analog and embedded. I just wanted to see if there is any update on your views on the embedded side? I know you said there was a little bit of a restructuring built into that $0.33 gain, I guess as a little bit of an offset. But the big picture question is, you are now down to the lowest percentage of sales embedded has been since at least in my model of 2012. And the year-over-year decline is so much larger than the analog side. So can you just talk a little bit about when do you think that business bottoms out? What sort of restructuring needs to be done? And do you think that business is a growth driver over time for the company? Or is it something that we should just envision as remaining a much smaller part of the company than it once was? Dave Pahl : Yes. I think when we look at the embedded business, the embedded market, as we talked about before, it shares many of the attributes that the analog market does and we believe that it will be, it has been and will continue to be a contributor to free cash flow growth. When you look at that business and look at the share gains that it's had, look at 2016, 2017 and really the better part of 2018, it has had share gains. It gave some of that back in 2019, of course. But here, more recently, we talked about last quarter, you saw some sequential growth out of that business all in. We talked about the fact that without auto, you would have seen sequential growth in that business this quarter. So I think we are seeing signs of stabilization inside of that business. So we have taken action to strengthen that business to dive into that. We have got across microcontrollers and processors, there is eight businesses. Three of them actually, we have increased resources. Two of them, we have actually decreased resources. And three of them have stayed about the same. So that's portfolio management that you have seen us take across our businesses over the years. So we do believe that that business will be a contributor to free cash flow. There is a lot of the work going on to ensure that it is. So, okay. Thank you very much Ross. And will go to the next caller. Operator : Thank you. We will hear from Chris Danley with Citi. Please go ahead. Chris Danley : Hi. Thanks guys. Dave, I think you mentioned that you thought there is some inventory buildout there. I believe you said it was just in industrial. Can you give us a sense of how much do you think that helped? And what gives you confidence it's not occurring in any other product lines? And did you guys notice anything, any kind of strength by certain geographies out there? Dave Pahl : Yes. Chris, you know that you have heard us talk, you have heard me say multiple times in the past that I joked that I have never once taken a double order or an order for an inventory build. And obviously, customers don't mark it that way when they send an order in. So that is something that we can't see. As I have talked about before with 60%, 65% of our revenue on consignment, we don't have inventory of our products sitting in front of the manufacturing line. So our visibility ends right there. So we don't have a system that tells us if customers are building inventory. But just when you look at the numbers and you look at the strength and you add things up, that's what our intuition tells us. So we are just mindful of that. We think it's important just to point that out. So could it be in other areas? It could be. But our belief is, it's not significant but we think it's important to point it out. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. And let me just add to that point. Your question was on the customer side. Let me remind you of the distribution side where we do have visibility, we drain $150 million of distributor-owned inventory. That's on top of the $50 million we drained last quarter. So, so far, year-to-date it's $200 million and we think we will be able to drain another $150 million or so for the rest of the year. So we will probably end up draining $350 million or so of inventory. And that make a lot of sense given the changes in distribution that we are making. We are bringing more customers direct. So then we can control that inventory will be, essentially on our balance sheet as we build more inventory on our balance sheet so we can support those customers direct. The other comment I will make regarding that, given that drain now we only have about three weeks of inventory in the distri-channel, down about a week from the prior quarter. But I will tell you that that metric is already less meaningful than it was before and it will continue to be less meaningful as we make that distribution channel smaller over time. But I just wanted to give the data point, so you have it. Do you have a follow-up Chris? Chris Danley : It's on that last statement. So you said that, you have got three weeks of inventory in the distri-channel. I guess if we look at your days of inventory right now, it's 170. I mean balance sheet looks like the feds from a first glance. Should we expect this to be the new normal going forward, like right around 170 days? Or should this be the same dollar level? Or I guess what should we sort of calibrate our models to, for inventory going forward at TI? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. A few comments. One is, as I just said, the distribution-owned inventory, we have been draining for seven quarters in a row. So if you look at the entire ecosystem, right, including the distribution inventories plus our inventory, over the last couple years, probably seven or eight quarters, is relatively flat, right. So you have to, I think it makes sense, we think it makes sense to think about it that way. And then the other angle, as I mentioned earlier and we talked about it in our prepared remarks, is the great optionality that having that inventory gives us. And we just showed that in second quarter and we will continue to do it because it is an asymmetric bet that having that inventory there is a working capital cost associated with that. But the scrap risk on that is really, really low, yet the potential upside of serving our customers well with very low lead times, in many cases as we said immediate availability, we think that longer term is something customers do and will continue to appreciate. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you Chris. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you very much. Dave, I apologize for the background noise. Economic activity is humming around where I live. Gross margin, the quarter margin was much higher than what a normal fall through model would suggest. So I was wondering, is it just a factor of how low embedded is and that's the mix that's contributing to the gross margin being so strong this quarter? Or is there something else going on? Because your utilization was flat quarter-on-quarter. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. What I would tell you, as we have guided for many years, you should think of revenue coming in and out at 70% to 75%. That's a good guide to use over the entire cycle. Of course, any one quarter could be a little more or a little less. And then over the longer term, of course, 300 millimeter and continuing to add revenue on 300 millimeter has a structural cost advantage that helps our margin just continue to be a tailwind on margins. It has been and will continue to be. Dave Pahl : Do you have follow-on, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes. I do. Back to microcontrollers, embedded, now that you have been looking at the data and I am sure you have been looking at it before. And it's good to see that stabilizing and you are seeing some signs of stabilization, especially, how low it is. Is there some insight you could provide us between the connected and the processor side that would help explain the divergence that we have seen from the overall analog over the last, not three years as you were pointing out first, if we look back at three years, only in the last six or seven quarters? Has it really been diverging from the industry? Dave Pahl : Yes. There is not that much difference in the trend between microcontrollers and the processor business. And really, if you look at the longer trend line and that's really what shares doesn't move around quickly inside of those businesses, whether it's analog or embedded overall and then if you drop down into microcontrollers or processors. So again, if you look at kind of 2016 and 2017 and the three quarters of 2018, those businesses really did have a real strong track record of share gains and the deterioration began to happen in 2019 where it gained some of that back. So again, we are taking the actions to strengthen that business. We believe that what we are doing will get that business performing and having it to be a strong contributor to free cash flow. So thank you Ambrish. And I think we have time for one more caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. There is very slow moving but I think long term relatively meaningful risk as it relates to China trying to develop a domestic strong semiconductor capability. Some might argue that given the current state of affairs, both economically and politically that perhaps there could be some acceleration in that regard recently. And I am hoping you might update us as to what you are seeing from this competitive threat. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So just to give you some thoughts on that. We think of that in a way similar as we think of our competitors, meaning that our competitive advantage has put us in a good place to compete against American, European competitors just as well as the Chinese. And having one, our own manufacturing with 300 millimeter, that puts us, gives us that structural cost advantage. The other one is the broadest portfolio in the industry, close to 100,000 different parts. And that's particularly relevant with industrial and automotive where, in the case of industrial for example, there are probably 80,000 different customers, right. So you want to be able to have the entire suite of parts in the analog space and embedded space. It makes it more likely that they will buy from you, it makes the investment on the sales side more worthwhile and then with the diverse and long-lived positions that results into. And partially because of those advantages and the way that is structured, it's just difficult to go after that space, right. So what we have seen where companies in China, really anywhere, where they first go after is the kind of vertical markets in places like memory or digital spaces that is frankly just easier to go after, easier to get revenue growing quickly and then you can reinvest that and go from there. In the analog space, we have average prices in the $0.30 to $0.40. Embedded is higher than that, but not that much higher. It's just hard. And then the 80,000 different customers that you go after, the 100,000 different parts is a daunting task, right. It's not impossible. So we are very respectful of that and our job is to stay ahead of all our competitors, no matter where they are, American, European, Asian. So we will continue investing in that, in those advantages, in manufacturing, in the broad portfolio, in the reach of channels to make that climb even harder every year. Do you have a follow-up? William Stein : Yes. I appreciate that answer. It sounds like there is no meaningful change recently in this threat relative to any others. I wanted to follow-up on the distribution commentary around, I think, another $150 million of inventory to go. When we think about the $50 million, the $150 million down in the quarter and I think you said $150 million left in the back half. Should we think about that as proportional to the amount or to the percentage of distribution business that's going to transition this year? And is that still on track to finish by the end of the year? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So it is on track to finish by the end of the year. And what happens there is, by the end of the year, we are just going have a much smaller distribution footprint, the number of distributors that we engage with. And at the same time, we will have transitioned a fair amount of customers to shipping direct. So with lesser distribution, we will deal with fewer distributors, then more of our revenue going direct. And that is, yes, I guess it is proportional to that drain of inventory that you are referring to. Dave Pahl : But it also includes reduction in inventory of the distributors that will be with us as well. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. I am glad you mentioned that. So yes, so part of what that reduction is, is that the distributors that we are going to stay with, for the most part, they will be on full consignment. So anything that we sell with them and there's a few exceptions in Japan, for example, but other than that, they will be in full consignment. So really they are going to have zero own inventory for the most part. So that is also reflected in the $350 million. Rafael Lizardi : So I think that was the last question. So let me just wrap up by summarizing what we have said previously. We will continue to invest in and strengthen our four competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will also continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be part of and would be proud to have as a neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners will all benefit. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and will provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter; next, I'll provide insight into the third quarter revenue results with more details than usual by end market, including some sequential performance since it's more informative at this time; and then lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, capital management, and our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020. Let me start with a quick overview with three key points. Revenue was higher than expected and grew 18% sequentially, with notable strength from the rebound of automotive and growing demand from personal electronics. Revenue increased 1% from the same quarter a year ago. In April and again in July, we explained we would maintain high optionality with our operating plan so we could support customers, particularly during a time when their ability to forecast will be limited. This approach has served us and our customers well and we'll continue this posture in the fourth quarter. Finally, while visibility for the near-term demand has improved, we remain cautious as the broader economic impact of the global pandemic could continue for several years. Our approach in an environment like this is to maintain high optionality with our operating plan in the short term, to continue critical investments in R&D and in new capabilities like those for ti.com, and finally, to invest to ensure long-term manufacturing capacity, particularly for the 2022 to 2025 timeframe. We've made these decisions with our overall ambitions in mind, which include running the company with the mindset of a long-term owner. These decisions have continued to serve us well. Looking at our segments, Analog grew 18% and Embedded Processing grew 19% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Analog grew 7% and Embedded Processing declined 10%. Our Other segment declined 19% from a year ago, primarily due to lower calculator sales or COVID-19 impacted back-to-school sales. Moving on, I'll now provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by end market. First, the automotive market rebounded with about 75% sequential growth and returned to levels similar to a year ago. Revenue has grown from the bottom we saw in May as North American and European automotive assembly plants resumed operations. Next, the industrial market was down low single-digits sequentially, roughly a sequential decline and about even from a year ago. Not surprisingly, there were areas of strength and there were areas of weakness. The diversity within industrial results in relative stability, reinforcing the attractiveness of this highly diverse market. Personal electronics was up more than 20% sequentially and up about 15% compared to a year ago. The strength was broad-based across personal electronics, combined with TI being in a position to support unforecasted demand in the third quarter. Next, comms equipment was down about mid-single-digits sequentially and up mid-single-digits from a year ago and enterprise systems was down both comparisons. Lastly, I'll note a housekeeping item. We've simplified our Analog business structure into our power business and our signal chain business. Starting this quarter, our reporting will reflect these changes. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $3.8 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.5 billion, or 64% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin decreased 60 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $793 million, up 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 23% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D. Operating profit was $1.6 billion in the quarter, or 42% of revenue. Operating profit was up 1% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $1.4 billion, or $1.45 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $146 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.2 billion. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 13%, marking our 17th consecutive year of dividend increases. In the quarter, we paid $825 million in dividends and repurchased $15 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $6.4 billion in the past 12 months, or 123% of free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 64% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were down $64 million from the prior quarter, and days were 137. Distribution-owned inventory declined in the third quarter by about $100 million, the eighth consecutive quarter of planned reductions, as we have continued the transition to have fewer distributors and bring more customers direct. As a reminder, as we build closer, direct relationships with our customers, we further strengthened one of our competitive advantages, the reach of our market channels. Tactically and strategically, we are pleased with the progress of the transition and the impact for our customers. For the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.41 billion to $3.69 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.40. Our annual operating tax rate has not changed much, but now rounds up to 14% for the year, and that's what you should use for your models in the fourth quarter. For next year, we expect our annual operating tax rate to remain at about 14%. In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Rafael, Dave, my first question is on automotive. You guys saw very strong results in the September quarter. I think you spoke to a 75% sequential increase in revenue in the automotive end market. What's your view on December as it relates to automotive? And how are you thinking about sustainability into the early part of 2021? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Thanks. Dave Pahl : Sure, Toshiya. Yes, I think that, that 75% sequential obviously was very strong, but it's probably best explained at looking at the previous quarter. And as we talked about last quarter, the majority of the automotive revenue is on consignment. So as the North American and European manufacturers had closed plants, that revenue reacted very quickly and we were down 40% sequentially and year-on-year, and so as those factories opened up, we saw the bottom in May. And we expected revenue to grow, and as they opened up, obviously, that revenue reacted very quickly in the other direction. So that's really the story that we saw in third quarter. Again, as we've given color last quarter on the automotive market and talked about how that was moving pretty significantly in the fourth quarter, we're not breaking out any particular end market or specific color on that front. So there's not a reason to as we look into the fourth quarter. So, you have a follow-on? Toshiya Hari : I do. Thanks, Dave. My follow-up question is on gross margins in Q3. Rafael, you mentioned that gross margins were down 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And I was just trying to better understand what the puts and takes were. Overall revenue, I think, was up 1%. Your mix of businesses improved with Analog up 7% year-over-year, embedded processing down 10%. And 12-inch versus eight, and so I'm guessing, 12-inch was up year-over-year. So I'm just trying to understand what the negatives were on a year-over-year basis that drove gross margins down a little bit. But I appreciate you guys don't run your business for gross margin, but just curious. Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, no, happy to answer that. So yeah, on a year-on-year basis, revenue was up 1%. Gross margin dollars were up, but a little less than that, maybe 0.5% or so. So -- but when you're looking at such a big number that then the delta is so small, it's difficult to look at the pull-through like we normally look at it, right? So in the big scheme of things, revenue was up a little bit and gross margin dollars were up a little bit. But having said that, I would also point out that the mix of personal electronics revenue was higher in third quarter than it's been what it was the same quarter last year or even second quarter. Dave Pahl : Great. Thanks, Toshiya. And we\u2019ll go to next caller please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Yes, thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on the last point on the strength in personal electronics. Really, as you look out to Q4, Dave, how do you feel about inventory versus end demand sell-through? And then as part of that and perhaps other segments as well, how you think about Huawei in terms of perhaps last shipments there and how you're seeing that as you go forward? Rafael Lizardi : Let me go ahead and start, and then Dave can address the Huawei question or anything else. But at the highest level, we are very well-positioned to handle whatever comes at us, whether it's personal electronics or any other market. But personal electronics is one that by having the inventory strategy that we have followed, having that optionality that we have talked about for now, 180 days or so, the last two quarterly releases has put us in a really, really good position. Now that is not just having that kind of tactical strategy, it's also -- or tactical position. It's also having the strategic position of being the supplier of catalog parts that are highly diversified, that sell to many, many customers. We have over 100,000 different customers, sell 80,000 different parts. So it put us in a position where we can build the inventory, have the asymmetric bet, so that if our revenue's strong, we can support it. If it's not, then we hold inventory a little longer than usual. But that's okay, it's just a little working capital. With that, I also want to make the point that inventory, we think, very -- it's a strategic asset. As we have talked about earlier, we're comfortable holding high levels of inventory. And in fact, we're going to update, we're going to give you an update on our range on inventory at the next capital management call in February. Dave? Dave Pahl : Sure. Yeah, I'll make the comment on Huawei. So Huawei was about 2% of our revenue in the third quarter. That was a little higher than what they were in the first half of 2020. So certainly we're in compliance with U.S. export restrictions and stopped shipping to them on September 14th, and they are not included in our fourth quarter revenue guidance. So do you have a follow-on, Craig? Craig Hettenbach : Sure. No, thanks for all the color there. I guess, just how you think about as the business rebounds, just from an OpEx perspective, any puts and takes there for Q4 and into next year? Rafael Lizardi : Nothing significant that I would point to. In OpEx, of course, R&D is a big part of that. It's about $1.5 billion a year. That's a big component of our competitive advantage of having the broadest portfolio in the industry. We continue to put out some of the best products, catalog products that go into automotive, industrial, personal electronics, communication market. So, we'll continue to strengthen that advantage. Another one that goes in OpEx in the G&A portion -- in the SG&A portion is the investment that we're making in ti.com to strengthen the reach of our channels. So, we continue to strengthen that tool, that ability to reach channels, reach customers better and keeping them engaged longer and selling more and more products to those customers. So at the highest level, OpEx has been running $3.1 billion, $3.2 billion a year on a trailing 12-month basis. I would expect for that to run at above that level, maybe over time up 1% or 2% year-on-year, but in that neighborhood. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller please? Operator : We'll take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one, I wanted to touch on the strength from PE. I wanted to know, if you can give us a little more color on how much of that would be PCs versus smartphones? I know that you had talked about some of that strength coming from your ability to satisfy unexpected demand. I assume that was maybe more a PC statement, but any color you could give us on sort of the relative mix and growth of those two sub-end markets would be helpful. Dave Pahl : Yes, Stacy, I'd say that as the pandemic first started back in March and even in last quarter, a lot of the strength was initially driven by PCs and tablets. But we have seen that strength broaden, so even to TVs and smart speakers and other things that are used in the home. So, our best estimate or guesstimate of what's going on is that as people are spending more time at home, they're upgrading the things that they're using more. So, that spend is broadening beyond just the PC. And as Rafael was talking about, our portfolio of products serves us well and puts us in a position to be able to support that demand. Do you have a follow-on? Stacy Rasgon : I do. Thank you. So I know, you're talking about continuing to hold high inventory levels and maintaining high service into Q4 and beyond, and I get that. I just want to know if you could give us any color on what that implies for your utilization and loading going forward. I'm assuming your utilization was up sequentially in Q2 -- in Q3, I mean. Please let us know if that was the case? And what are your plans for utilization, factory loadings as we go into Q4 and the end of the year? Rafael Lizardi : Sure. So Stacy, as you know, we only talk about utilization when there's a big inflection point or something unusual. So we did talk about it in April going into second quarter because most people -- most other vertical competitors decreased their loading. And instead, we kept them flat at that point to first quarter to maintain that option, to have that optionality that frankly has served us tremendously well during these last six months. Since second quarter, we have biased up our loadings, so we did that from second to third, a little higher. And third and going to fourth, we'll probably bias that up -- we are biasing that up higher. It's nothing significant. But it is biased up, so that we maintain that optionality and we can maximize revenue and support our customers with any potential upsides that they have that are -- also, that would be unsupported otherwise. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Stacy. We\u2019ll go to the next caller please? Operator : We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. I guess my first question is on the share buyback. It was quite small, even lower than in the depths of the financial crisis back in 2008. Yet your business has already snapped back a lot. What's the thinking there? You've always been pretty astute about the intrinsic value of your stock, so how should investors sort of read that? Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. No, first, let me step back and remind everybody how we think about cash returns. And we talk about this during capital management every year in February and when we meet with investors. But when we think about cash returns, the objective there is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company via buybacks and dividends. We use both. And if you look at in the last -- on a trailing 12-month basis, which is the best way to look at that, we have generated $5.2 billion of free cash flow and have returned $6.4 billion. So $1.2 billion more than the generation, so well ahead of the generation, the return has been. Do you have a follow-up? Timothy Arcuri : I did, I did. So I wanted to double-click just a little bit on the drop-through in Analog. It seemed like the drop-through in embedded was fine, but you're still a little below where the op margin was back in sort of the late 2018 time frame at sort of similar levels. Is there something going on with mix? Is that maybe the PE mix that you were talking about before within Analog? Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : There's nothing unusual there to comment. Clearly, analog is the biggest segment that we have. So anything that we would comment at the company level applies -- likely came from analog. And they have a fair amount of PE impact, a disproportionate amount of personal electronics, given that embedded doesn't have much personal electronics, so yes. Dave Pahl : Okay. Yes. And embedded is essentially industrial and automotive for the most part. Probably 90% of those two. So that's where that growth would come from. So thank you Tim and we\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution. Can you guys just give us the quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year trajectories by geography? I know they're just shipped to locations, but I think it's still useful as a proxy for demand and overall economic activity, just depending on the breadth of the participation? Dave Pahl : Sure, Harlan. Yes. A year ago, Asia was up and all of the other regions were down. And sequentially, all of the regions were up, and Japan was down. Do you have a follow-on? Harlan Sur : Yes. So you guys mentioned last quarter that there may have been some industrial customers that were building some inventory to potentially buffer against future supply chain disruptions and just prudent business continuity planning. Did you guys continue to see that in Q3? Or are these customers starting to work down these inventories, or just sustaining the higher levels as we head into the winter months and flu season? Dave Pahl : Yes. And, Harlan, I think our comments last quarter were one, just more of an observation of history in our industry, that basically it's taught us that whenever we've seen supply constraints, that customers react by building some inventory. So it's just our belief that it would be naive that this would be the first time that, that wouldn't happen, right? So, I think, that those supply constraints in our industry still exist. So to that extent, that could still be the case. And now our lead times have remained stable. Our product availability is still very high. I think today, you can go to ti.com and get immediate availability of over 40,000 different devices. And that doesn't mean that we don't have pockets of delivery problems. We'll always have that at any time. But, overall, our lead times are very solid. And availability is high, but that's not true for the industry. So, yes, I think it just would be naive to believe that, that wouldn't be the case. So thank you, Harlan. We\u2019ll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask some questions. Congratulations on the solid results. David, if you look at kind of your guidance over the last two quarters, it looks like you sort of rightfully discounted kind of what the bottoms-up bookings was telling us. You said as much when you guided for the June quarter. And just given the magnitude of beat in September, it kind of feels the same way. And that to me seems to make sense in the midst of a global pandemic. I'm just kind of curious, you're guiding the December quarter to plus or minus about seasonal, inclusive of what sounds like a 200 basis point headwind from Huawei. But, I guess, I could argue maybe phone builds started a little bit later this year that should help December. I guess, as you forecast the December quarter, was seasonal kind of the metric you were going for? And are you discounting kind of your bottoms-up in the December quarter as much in hindsight as you did in June and September? Dave Pahl : Yes. No, I think, you've covered a lot of good points, John. And like you point out, in any quarter there's puts and takes. You've got the headwind of Huawei. We've got the unwind of the distributor program, which in fact we've actually wound that up this past quarter, and just with the growing demand and the inventory needs and positions that we've essentially completed that. So we depleted about, as Rafael, I think mentioned, about $100 million worth of inventory in that quarter. So you've always got puts and takes. But I'll tell you that the most important thing that we see and the most important input that we get is the demand that our customers tell us they want. And we get that from the orders in the backlog that our customers provide us as well as demand fees that we get through consignment. And so that is really what drives and informs the outlook that we provide. So you have a follow-on, John? John Pitzer : Yes. Dave, it's fair to say that there's been nothing typical this year, but you and I have talked about this in the past. If you look at the year-over-year growth discrepancy between analog and embedded, it's fairly wide. And I'm wondering now that we're 90 days more into this kind of difference in year-over-year growth, is there a good explanation in your mind? And importantly as we look forward, when do you expect the embedded business to kind of catch up to analog on a year over year basis? Dave Pahl : Yes, sure. I think that certainly, the embedded business isn't performing the way that we would want it to over the last multiple quarters. And I think that if you look over the most recent quarter here, certainly we're encouraged by the progress or the numbers that, that would show. But we've been working very hard on turning that business around and getting it performing like we would like it to be performing. And we're making investments there because we believe that it will be a great contributor in the coming years. So -- and so we're busy building that business stronger, and -- but it will take time. And success in that business will be not measured over this quarter or even over a couple of quarters, but will be measured over time. So thank you for that, John. And with that, we will go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. I wanted to follow-up on that same last question of John's on the embedded side of things. Dave, last quarter where embedded was sequentially weak and year-over-year weak, you talked about the over-indexing to automotive and industrial. But given that automotive was up 75% sequentially, I'm a little surprised embedded was basically the same as analog from a sequential perspective. Were there some offsets in that business? I know you said industrial was down a little bit, but it doesn't seem like it would be enough to offset that over-indexing on the -- excuse me, on the Automotive side? Dave Pahl : Yes. Well, embedded grew a little faster than analog. And essentially just as last quarter as you pointed out Ross, that it didn't have any offsets to the business. Essentially, all you have left is industrial. So it's those two end markets. And so with the return of revenue, it's performing about the same as analog is. So those are the two -- those are really the two components driving that. Rafael Lizardi : So it doesn't have nearly as much PE or in fact hardly any PE, personal electronics. And personal electronics was a big contributor to growth in third quarter, sequential growth. Dave Pahl : That's right. That's right. Do you have a follow-on? Ross Seymore : Great. I guess my follow-up. Yeah. If I can pivot over to the industrial side, just a higher-level question. You guys seem to be flat to up year-to-date in your industrial segment. How do you explain the actual growth in that segment versus the global GDP and the general economic activity dropping? It doesn't seem like the inventory concerns are as high as what you had last quarter, where you first said it would be naive to think otherwise. It seems like some of those concerns have gone by the wayside, but you're still nonetheless outperforming the global economy. If it's not inventory, I guess, what is it? Dave Pahl : Well, the longer-term thesis of course is that content is expanding inside of those markets. And I think if you look below, we talked about there's areas of strength and there's areas of weakness. So if you look at certain markets like aerospace and defense that is obviously weak, people aren't taking deliveries of planes, as an example. There's other areas of strength like appliances. If anyone that's listening on the call that is doing any home renovations like my wife is, you have to wait multiple months to, just to get home appliances. And so we're seeing very, very strong strength in those types of areas. So \u2013 but I think the diversity of that market, coupled with the content expansion, I think just proves out why it's such an attractive market for us. And our products are really tailor-made and well positioned to take advantage of that market. Rafael Lizardi : Right. And the other thing I would add is listen, we have 100,000 different customers, 80,000 different products. The vast majority of those sell in to industrial. That is the most diverse end market. So it'd be impossible for us to know what those customers are doing and what that adds up to. The important part is the way we run the company to give ourselves the highest possible optionality, so that if it is driven by secular trends or asset is driven by the secular trends over the long haul, maybe any one quarter it could, or two quarters it could oscillate. And it could be inventory building. But over the long term, those secular trends are there, and we put ourselves in a good position tactically to have that inventory available to support our customers. And if we have a correction, inventory correction or something of that sort, we'll go through that. And that inventory will not go back. It will not go back. We'll have it in storage for years, and then we'll sell it at the other end of that, of whatever correction we may have. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Raf. We\u2019ll go to the next caller, please Operator : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. I wanted to ask John's question a bit differently. Does it feel like bookings are not going to back to reflecting true end demand? Obviously, this year everything has been abnormal, right? But as I think about your fourth quarter guidance, is it safe to say that bookings are now running very much aligned with end demand? Dave Pahl : Well, Tore, that's always a question that we don't have precise insight to, right? We don't have a system that tells us that. I think you have to even go back to third quarter 2018, where the market had turned. We're going through a classic inventory cycle. We worked our way through that through 2019. And just as we bottomed out and saw signs of inflection, COVID-19 hit. So that kind of changed things, but certainly we started this year with inventories at lower levels. And so that \u2013 certainly, that's where we started the year, right? So \u2013 but inventories and demand are certainly tied together. And \u2013 so I don't believe that they were ever largely disconnected over time. Rafael Lizardi : And so much of our business is on consignment or just-in-time demand, that the bookings versus revenue trend is really not that meaningful. Dave Pahl : That's right. Yes. So it's almost what inventory our customers have that's downstream. And so that's why I think that we, from an optionality standpoint, try to ensure that we've got product available that if things want to continue to strengthen from here, we're in a position to support it. And that's the posture that we're taking. If it doesn't, we certainly know what to do in the other direction as well. You have a follow-on, Tore? Tore Svanberg : Yes, that's fair. Thank you. So I know communications is smaller for you and it may even be less of a strategic end market for you, but it did take a sequential breather. It was still up year-over-year. Directionally, do you have any views on where that market is headed? Dave Pahl : Well, it \u2013 I think that our longer-term thesis is, is that it's not a structural grower, just there's not new subscribers being added to the network overall. We've made investments in 5G, and we'll benefit from it. But as you say, it's just not a very large portion of our revenues.  Certainly, there's noise in this quarter's numbers with Huawei, but growth will resume. And as it always does, I think everyone in the industry describes it as a choppy market and that doesn't make it a bad market, it just makes it choppy. And so we'll continue investments there. It's a good market for us. And we'll continue to make investments in it, and we continue to like it.  And thank you, Tore. I think we've got time for one last caller, please? Operator : We'll take our last question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave and Rafael, I had a question on the industrial business as well. So clearly it's seemingly very resilient if I look back at the past cycles. But is it also because -- and I know you guys look at it very long-term as well.  2019, for four consecutive quarters and for the full year, it was down. So is this because as we -- and I think Dave, you mentioned that in an answer to an earlier question, is that when we entered the year, really it was -- the supply chain was drained out of any excesses because of what you have seen. And so now we are, despite all the problems we've seen and the demand collapsing in certain end markets and industrials, it's held in also because of that factor, that the supply chain inventory was pretty lean? Dave Pahl : Yes. I think we've just completed seven quarters of year-on-year declines. This is the first quarter of year-on-year growth that we've had. So industrial's been a piece of that. I think those year-on-year declines, a good part of that was just our industry cyclicality, as you pointed out. So I -- that -- but structurally, industrial with its breadth and if you look, we've got 13 sectors that we're investing in. All of them are -- have content that's growing. And so we're -- I think we're very positioned -- positioned very well to be able to support that growth. So what we can't call and what we don't know is in the short-term, how the economy is going to behave. And even in a weak environment, that market has done reasonably well compared to some of the other markets. You have a follow-on? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes, just a quick one on the Embedded side. I think last earnings call also, you mentioned that you're encouraged by the signs of stabilization. I just wanted to -- just help us understand what are some of the steps you have taken to ride the business. And as you've said, it doesn't happen overnight. And you talked about investments and I know several years ago, you said that you were going to de-emphasize comms infrastructure, because that's longer term, you didn't see growth there, at least on the comms on the Embedded side. So is the investment profile in this business looking a little bit different as you look forward? And what are some of the other steps that you guys have taken to \"ride\" the business and get it back on track? Dave Pahl : Yes. The -- yes, so you've highlighted a couple of steps that we have taken in the past. I think none of those have been secrets. The decisions on the comms side was something that we had talked about, I think, going back six, seven years ago now, as we didn't believe that comms equipment was going to be a structural grower. And specifically on the Embedded side, we did believe that there was some opportunities on the Analog side, so we took up investments there. And we're enjoying the benefits of those investments on the Analog side today, but that did provide a headwind. We talked about, I think, it was a couple of quarters ago now the -- some of the restructuring that you mentioned inside of the Embedded business. And we've got, I think, eight different product groups and we took down some of the resources in some and took up some of the resources in others. And really just getting resources on to the best opportunities overall and making sure that we have resources into the places that we believe will be the best growth opportunities. And I'd just say in general, what we're trying to do is leverage our competitive advantages, ensure that the products that we are investing in have a broad-based appeal in a customer base standpoint and they'll be products that will generate cash flow for a long time to come. And just taking a step back, again, I'd say that we're investing in that business, because we believe it will be a great contributor when we look at the years ahead, so. And so again, there's a lot of effort going into building that business stronger, but it will take time. So that's success would be measured over years, not just in a quarter or two. So with that, I'll turn it over to Rafael to wrap us up for the night. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave. Let me wrap up by emphasizing what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for our owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. Our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements : A great business model focused on Analog and Embedded Products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages; two, discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities; and lastly, efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. While we strive to achieve our objectives, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When we're successful, our employees, customers and communities and owners all benefit. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to today's Texas Instruments Q4 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn things over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2020 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the Notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call to review our capital management on February 4 at 10 a.m. Central time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insight into our business and approach to capital allocation. For today\u2019s call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. And next, I'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenues results. And as we have done in the past few quarters, we\u2019ll provide details by end market, including sequential performance, since it's more informative at this time. I will also provide the annual summary of revenue breakout by end markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, some insight into the one-time items and our guidance for the first quarter of 2021. So, starting with a quick overview of the fourth quarter. The company's revenue increased 7% sequentially and 22% year-over-year, driven by strong demand in automotive, personal electronics and the industrial markets. Analog revenue grew 9%, and Embedded grew 11% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Analog revenue grew 25% and Embedded grew 14%. Our Other segment grew 4% from a year ago quarter. Moving on, I'll now provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. First, the automotive market continued its rebound following the second quarter bottom, with 19% sequential growth and 25% year-over-year growth. The industrial market was up 7% sequentially and 16% from the year ago. The strength was seen across most market sectors. Personal electronics was up 11% sequentially and up 39% compared to a year ago. The strength was broad-based across sectors and customers within personal electronics. Next, as expected, communications equipment was down 28% sequentially and down 8% from the year ago. Enterprise systems was down 2% sequentially and down 13% from the year ago. And lastly, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2020. We break our end markets into six categories that are grouped by their life cycles and market characteristics. The six end markets are industrial, automotive, personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs, communications equipment, enterprise systems, and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for the year, industrial was 37%, automotive 20%, personal electronics 27%, communications equipment 8%, enterprise systems 6%, and other was 2%. Looking at the changes versus 2019, industrial increased one percentage point, automotive declined 1%, personal electronics increased 4 percentage point, communications equipment declined 3 percentage point, enterprise systems was even, and other declined one percentage point. In 2020, industrial and automotive combined made up 57% of TI's revenue, about even with last year, and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technology to make their end products smarter, safer, more connected and more efficient. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application, which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets. Rafael, will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.6 billion, or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 230 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $786 million, down 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 22% of revenue. For the year, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We\u2019re pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top-line over the long term. Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $47 million in the fourth quarter. Acquisition charges will remain at about this level through the third quarter of 2021. Operating profit was $1.8 billion, or 44% of revenue. Operating profit was up 45% from the year ago quarter.  Other income and expense was $162 million in the quarter due to a one-time benefit related to the signing of a multi-year royalty agreement. Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion, or $1.80 per share, which included a $0.16 benefit that was not in our prior outlook, primarily due to the royalty agreement we just mentioned. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $212 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.5 billion, down 5% from a year ago. In the quarter, we paid $937 million in dividends. We have increased our dividend per share by 13%, marking our 17th year of dividend increases. We repurchased $15 million of our own stock for a total return of cash to owners in the fourth quarter of about $1 billion. For the year 2020, we returned $6 billion, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $6.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt was $6.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 123, down 21 days from a year ago, and down 14 days sequentially. Now, let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2020, cash flow from operations was $6.1 billion. Capital expenditures were $649 million, or 4.5% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2020 was $5.5 billion, or 38% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value. And after accretive investments in the business, the remaining cash will be returned over time via dividends and share repurchases. Over the last 12 months, we paid $3.4 billion in dividends and purchased $2.6 billion of our shares, reducing outstanding share count by 1.4% in 2020. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.79 billion to $4.11 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.66. We expect our 2021 annual operating tax rate to continue to be about 14% and our effective tax rate about a percentage point lower than that. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best market opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on the solid results. David, Rafael, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about just the current demand backdrop. I mean, clearly, we are hearing about lead time stretching out in the semi industry, many of your peers are talking about raising pricing. I guess, specifically to you guys, can you help us understand what your lead times are doing? What you guys are thinking about doing around pricing? And I guess more importantly, given your inventory strategy and the fact that you ran your fabs a little bit fuller last year, do you think the current results represent your ability to gain some incremental share as some of your peers just are having a harder time supplying customers right now? Dave Pahl : Yes, John, let me take \u2013 you covered a lot of ground with that first question. So, let me take some pieces of it. Rafael if you want to add anything and if I miss anything, John, we'll give you a chance for the follow-up. But the first one is certainly we've read the same reports, and seeing the same releases from our peers on the supply constraints in raising prices. The short answer \u2013 we doing that, the short answer is no. And, I think, that that brings us to one of our foundational competitive advantages is manufacturing and technology, and that really provides two benefits. One, is the obvious, which is lower cost; but the second is greater control of our supply chain. So, it's really times like this and really throughout 2020, that greater control of your supply chains really becomes a great advantage. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, I will just add on the inventory angle of your question, John. Remember our long-term objective for inventory, as we have talked about in many capital management calls is to maintain high levels of customer service, while we minimize inventory obsolescence. Now, part of the reason we can do that is that we are strategically positioned the way we run the company, our business model and competitive advantages where we \u2013 our parts are mainly catalog parts that sell into industrial and automotive. Our focus is on those with very long product life cycle, so we can build inventory ahead of demand, we can position that inventory well that served us well in 2020 and will continue to serve us well from a business model standpoint in order to maintain those high levels of customer service with our customers. So, I think, we got most of the pieces, John, you have a follow-up or other pieces we can touch on? John Pitzer : Yes, just a quick follow-up Rafael. Rafael, I know you don't specifically guide gross margins, but I was wondering if you give us some parameters around OpEx for the next couple of quarters. I mean, we're heading into strong cyclical recovery in revenue off of what was kind of an unusual expense year last year with COVID. And so, as we think about the March quarter, can you help us kind of frame the period costs around SG&A and R&D that we should be thinking about? And if you want to give us a gross margin target, that would be great. But I know you tend to avoid that. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, on a gross margin like we have said before, just think of 70% to 75% fall through. So, you figure out what revenue, incremental revenue you want to play in and just follow that through at 70% to 75% and you'll get a good place over the long-term right, any one quarter can be a little higher to the lower, right.  On OpEx, we talked about we can operate between 20% and 25%. In the last three or four years, we have been between 21% and 22% pretty much, right. So, I don't mean to narrow that phrase, but that's where we've been running and I would expect to stay somewhere in that neighborhood. Dave Pahl : Between 20% and 25%? Rafael Lizardi : Yes between 20% and 25%. Dave Pahl : Right. Okay. Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : That will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the strong growth. Just wanted to follow-up on the demand question. And I'm curious, even if you are able to supply because of your very strong, strategic capacity, do you think your customers, especially on the automotive side, might be constrained with other parts of the bill of materials that they get from others and maybe those become bottlenecks? I'm just trying to reconcile the very strong demand backdrop that we are hearing from your results and your outlook, versus all the news around auto supply chains facing more constraints. What is the true sense of kind of supply and demand across your customer base would be very helpful to hear your views? Dave Pahl : Sure Vivek. Yes, I think, that's a great question. We see the same reports that you are seeing. And, I think, the best way to maybe describe what we're seeing in the automotive market is a just in time supply chain that's restarting from essentially a full stop that happened in second quarter. And just as a reminder, what we saw in third quarter was a 75% sequential increase followed by this last quarter with a 20% sequential increase. So, what I'll say is, is that those reports are fairly widespread, but we aren't seeing demand signals that would show us that there is anything that's consistent with any of those constraints that you are pointing out or that are in press releases. Do you have a follow on? Vivek Arya : Yes. Thank you, Dave. Good to see the growth in the Embedded segment and I know you made some changes in that business last year. Do you think we will start to see the benefits of that in 2021, because they also tend to be somewhat stickier markets, so I'm just curious if you could give us an update on what are you doing specifically to regain market share? And do you think we can start to see your Embedded business start to grow in line with your Analog business this year? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes. I'll give you a feel on those ones. So first, we're pleased with the progress we're seeing in Embedded. Our plan has called to first stabilize the business and then start to prove that we can resume our long-term consistent growth. We're leveraging our competitive advantages, particularly building a broad-based, a more diverse product portfolio that can then deliver long-term sustainable growth. I think it was in second quarter of 2020 where we announced, where we had a restructuring charge related to Embedded and we reallocated resources from some product lines, increased investments, some \u2013 we decreased other side about the same and we're seeing the beginning of that stabilization on that front. Okay. Thank you for that. Now we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : We will hear next from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Yes. Thank you. Dave, just following up on your comments around autos, and particularly the just-in-time inventory angle, certainly 2020 was a challenging year for the supply chain and we're dealing with some of those repercussions now. But do you think you'll see some changes to that over time in terms of how they operate from an inventory perspective or something that, it might be difficult for the next couple of quarters, but kind of gets back to that just-in-time? Dave Pahl : Yes, Craig. I don't want to speak for our customers or how they're managing their inventories. I think as you've seen us and how we've managed our business and our operations. We\u2019ve just worked very hard to try to have capacity in place to support our customer's needs. You saw the decisions that we made earlier in the year to try to keep high service and optionality in place. And we'll just continue to try to support our customer's needs, whatever their supply chains look like so and whether that's in the automotive market or the other market. So we will try to make them happy. That's what we're trying to do. Do you have follow-on? Craig Hettenbach : I do thanks. And then just looking at Analog up 25% year-over-year, I know that comes off of a difficult year and coming out of a down cycle. And so that's some of it, but just curious at a high-level just to get your thoughts of just the type of strength you're seeing and how you feel about what the demand is out there? Dave Pahl : Can you clarify that a little bit for me, Craig? Just so I make sure I answer the right question. Craig Hettenbach : Yes. So just with the Analog business up 25% year-over-year, that's coming off of an easy comp, if you will, coming out of the down cycle, so I think that's some of it. But just curious, I know in some of these calls you talked about just your view of just, our supply and demand equilibrium, or how you feel like demand is relative to how your businesses is trending right now? Dave Pahl : Well. Yes. I think that when you look at where that business is, I think that we've just come through a \u2013 from a cyclical indicators and those types of things. You'd even have to go back to 2018 when the industry had reached the cyclical peak then you throw-in, sprinkle on top. COVID-19 and it was really at the beginning of -- or at the end of last year, the beginning of 2020 that we had begun to seeing signs of stabilization before COVID had hit. So, inventories really weren't a problem at that point in time. And we had said at that point in time that our shipments were beginning to reflect what customers were beginning to ship overall. So again, I think that what we are shipping today is reflective of what customers are asking us to ship. We have a good availability of product, because of the decisions that we've made. And our lead-times have remained stable. That doesn't mean, of course that we don't have hotspots that we're working. And we always have hotspots, but that's kind of where we are today. Thank you, Craig. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : We will hear next from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong execution. Amidst the strong demand environment, as we all know, foundry capacity is pretty tight both leading edge and lagging edge. And I know that TI outsources about 20% of its wafer requirements most of it with your embedded products, MPUs, MCUs. So because of the foundry tightness, is the team also somewhat constrained on your Embedded products either Q4 or here in Q1 and also the same thing from an assembly and test perspective, or I think about 40% of your assembly and test requirements are outsourced to the sub-cost. Is this constraining, maybe some of your shipments near term? Dave Pahl : At a high-level, we have long-term agreements with these suppliers like we do with other suppliers. Even though we only outsource relatively small part of our loadings. We're still being a big company that\u2019s still a good amount of loadings raise. So we still get some decent leverage. So we're seeing some hotspots here and there, but to the largest degree we're getting what we need. Harlan Sur : Yes. Rafael Lizardi : And I would say, having 80% of our wafer sourced internally, almost all of our analogs sourced internally and that is a great advantage for us. So overall, as we've talked about the lead times, lead times have remained stable. So that has been a huge advantage for us. Do you have a follow-on Harlan? Harlan Sur : Yes, absolutely. Yes. Thanks for the insights there. Can you guys just provide us with the shipment trends quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year by geography? I know it's shipped to location, but I think it's still useful to kind of understand the breadth of the overall demand profile you guys are seeing ? Rafael Lizardi : Sure. So, in the quarter and thank you for the preamble there, so I won't repeat it. But year ago, Asia was up and all of the other regions were either flat or down and sequentially all the regions except for the U.S. were up. And just as another point of color on where we ship our products, 90% of our revenues come from shipments outside of the U.S. and we've got about 20% of our revenues that are based by customers in China. So just a little bit more color on the comment that you made there earlier. So thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : We\u2019ll hear now from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Rafael, I guess I asked this question last quarter too, but you, again bought back next to no stock, and I totally get that you were running a -- kind of a plan in the first half, and you were certainly a head of the 100% for the full-year, but you also have a pretty strong intrinsic value model for the share repo and you were pretty good at buying back the stock. So I guess maybe I'll ask you again to just sort of comment on that. Is there anything that we can read into that, given that it's the second quarter in a row? Rafael Lizardi : You know, what I would tell you is that as we talk about doing capital management, our goal is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. We generated in 2020; $5.5 billion of free cash flow and we generated $6 billion of free cash flow, so clearly well above the cash flow generation. So following... Timothy Arcuri : Okay. And then I guess, yes, yes, yes, I do. I guess, can you give us an update on the 300 millimeter, the new FAB and sort of the timing around that, and I guess on that, can you qualify for some of these subsidies coming from the government or is that mostly going to be leading edge? Things. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, sure. So the update on the factory is the same, nothing has changed as far as our expectation. The new factory is being built. We expected to be completed in 2022; so next year. In fact, we should have some form \u2013 some level of output in the second half of next year. So that's all going in as per plane. When it's fully equipped, it has the potential for revenue of about $5 billion per year. On your question on the incentives that a lot of that remains to be seen, there are two legislations, one, one that was approved, but was not funded; another one hasn't been approved. The chips, I think is the one that hasn't been approved, but the one that was approved was not even funded, so \u2013 and there's a lot of uncertainties on that depending on how that comes out. So when that comes out, we'll look at it and we'll decide if it makes sense for us. But the biggest or the highest level we think semi-conductor is a foundational technology and anything that the government can do to strengthen that and to keep us at a level playing field companies in the United States versus other countries that would be a good. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Tim. And I think we've got time for one more caller, please. Operator : That will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the results. First question for Rafael, I typically wouldn't ask you this because I know you get a lot of these, but the royalty this quarter was pretty material $162 million. Can you maybe add any color on that and should we expect sizeable things like that going forward as well? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So it was about, inside that $162 million, it was more \u2013 most of that $162 million and we recognize it based on accounting rules. The cash actually comes in, not quite like that. It comes in over time, but it's just \u2013 it's a licensing agreement. We've had those for many years. They have become the minimums in the \u2013 at the highest level, frankly. So I don't expect that to change from a cash standpoint is about $100 million a year. So from the revenue or the income recognition standpoint, sometimes they come in as pops as what you saw, but they've passed, which is really what matters is more stable than that. And again, like I said, it's about $100 million a year and I don't expect that to change much. Dave Pahl : Yes, follow-on Tore? Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you, Dave. So I know your long-term goal is to grow CapEx at 6% \u2013 well to spend 6% of your revenues and CapEx. I think last year you said it was 4.5%; was there sort of any COVID related issues that slowed things down? And as we look at 2021, do you think it will come in close to that, that, that range sort of 6%? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So I'll go ahead and take that. So, yes, our guidance is 6%. Our guidance continues to be 6% CapEx has presented revenue. That's a long-term guidance includes everything that goes into CapEx as far as building and equipment. Now of course that number can fluctuate, right? Like you pointed out, it just \u2013 it just fluctuated down in 2020 to 4.5%. So I wouldn't be surprised if it is a little higher than 6% for a year or two, but for your models I would suggest you stick with 6% out into the future. It's just \u2013 it's simpler that way, and it gets the point across. Tore Svanberg : Okay. Thank you so much. Rafael Lizardi : Thank you, Tore. Dave Pahl : That concludes the call. So let me finish with a few comments and key items that we believe deeply. First, we run the company with the mindset of being a long-term owner. We believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value. Our ambitions and values are integral to how we built TI stronger. When we're successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities, and shareholders, all win. Okay. And thank you all for joining us. The replay of this call will be available shortly on our website. Good evening. Operator : And again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining us.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and will provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter; next, I'll provide insight into the first quarter revenue results with more details than usual by end market, including some sequential performance since it's more informative at this time; and then lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, some insights into onetime items, and our guidance for the second quarter of 2021. Starting with a quick overview of the first quarter. The company\u2019s revenue increased 5% sequentially and 29% year-over-year driven by strong demand in industrial, automotive and personal electronics. On a sequential basis, Analog grew 5% and Embedded Processing grew 7%. On a year-over-year basis, Analog grew 33% and Embedded Processing grew 17%. Our other segment grew 12% from a year ago quarter. Moving on, given the current environment, again this quarter, I\u2019ll provide some insights into our first quarter revenue by end market and then some comments on our lead times. First, the industrial market was up about 20% sequentially and up almost 30% from the year ago. The strength was seen across most sectors. The automotive market was about even compared to a very strong fourth quarter 2020 and up about 25% from a year ago. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 levels the fourth of 2019 our shipments to automotives in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 were up about 25% as we work to help our automotive customers recover from their supply chain disruptions. Personal electronics was down about 10% sequentially and up about 50% compared to the year ago. The strength was broad based across sectors and customers within personal electronics. Next communications equipment grew in the high teens sequentially, and was about even from the year ago. Enterprise systems grew upper single digit sequentially, and was down about 10% from the year ago. Regarding lead times, over 80% of our products have steady lead times, and more than 50,000 parts have off the shelf availability via ti.com. However, the growing demand in the first quarter of 2021 did expand our list of hotspots, which required extending some lead times. We will continue to add incremental capacity in 2021 and the first half of 2022 with additional support from the start-up of our third 300 millimeter wafer fab, RFAB II that will come online in the second half of 2022. As discussed during our Capital Management Review in February, our competitive advantage of internal manufacturing and technology delivers the benefits of lower costs and greater control of our supply chain, which really shows through a market environment like this. Raphael will now look and review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave. And good afternoon everyone. First quarter revenue was $4.3 billion up 29% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion, or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 250 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $811 million, up 2% from a year ago. And about as expected, on a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 21% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, acquisition charges and non-cash expense were $47 million in the first quarter. Acquisition charges will remain at about this level through the third quarter of 2021 and then go to zero. Operating profit was $1.9 billion in the quarter or 45% of revenue. Operating profit was up 56% from a year ago quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $1.8 billion, or $1.87 per share, which included a $0.02 net benefit that was not in our prior outlook, primarily due to discrete tax benefit, which was partially offset by about $50 million of utility costs related to the February winter storm in Texas. Most of this expense is in our cost of revenue and reported in our other segment results. Let me now comment our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $308 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.3 billion. In the quarter we paid $940 million in dividends and repurchase $100 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $4.5 billion in the past 12 months. Over the same period, our dividend represented 56% of free cash flow underscoring its sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $6.7 billion of cash and short term investments at the end of the first quarter. We retire $550 million of debt in the quarter leaving $6.3 billion of total debt with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Regarding inventory, TI-inventory dollars were down $65 million from the prior quarter, and dates were 114. For the second quarter, we expect TI-revenue in the range of $4.13 to $4.47 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.92. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 14%. In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions in order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question after our response we\u2019ll provide you the opportunity for an additional follow up, operator? Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to Chris Danley with Citi. Christopher Danley : Hey, thanks, guys. So Q1 clearly was very strong, well above seasonality and above guidance, however, your sequential guidance is flat is well below seasonality. So my question is, are you guys seeing, cancellations and push outs or why that's such weak guidance after a strong Q1? Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, Chris. Yes, thanks for that question. We aren\u2019t seeing cancellation or push outs. I just say that if you look into, to your observations, Q1 was very strong both sequentially, and year-on-year. So, at the midpoint, second quarter will be a strong quarter from a year-on-year standpoint, you have a follow up. Christopher Danley : Yes, I mean, I guess would just be a follow on to the first question, this would be the lowest sequential guidance you guys have given in some time. So I guess why not? Why not guide for a seasonal or even close seasonal sequential guide? Dave Pahl : Yes, it really Chris it is the best estimate that we have for our revenue for the quarter. And, again, I would describe it as, following a very strong first quarter. It will, it will be a strong quarter again. So okay, thank you. We'll go to the next caller. Operator : And next we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. I want to talk about your inventory strategy. I know you have a strategy to build out inventory for customer service. I guess how do I reconcile that that with the fact that your inventory dollars are down, and you're still getting some pockets of lead time of extended weakens? Is that just a function of demand of the poles is just so strong you can't keep up? And I guess in that light, how do you parse the quality of those orders that you're getting? How do you know? Are you just having to just shipping whatever is being asked for at this point? And I guess, like what are the plans for loadings and inventories as we go into Q2, you're going to try to replenish the inventory that's been drained? Rafael Lizardi : Now, so thanks for your question, Stacy. So first, let me step back and remind everyone inventory our objective there is to maintain high levels of customer service minimize, while we minimize obsolescence and improve manufacturing realization. And as you alluded in the question, we would prefer to have higher levels of inventory. In fact, what 60 days ago a day capital management strategy, we increased the target for inventory to 130 to 190 days up from 115, 145. Prior to that, so yes, we'd like to have more inventory. But in the current environment, we're focusing our capacity on fulfilling demand, not on building inventory, whenever things slowdown, which at some point that will, or and or as we increase capacity, which we are increasing capacity incrementally, we have them will continue to their to the balance of this year into the first half of next year. And then in the second half of next year, we will have a first output from our RFAB II as those things come together, then we will be able to build more inventory. I know you had a couple other parts of that question. But why don't you use your follow up for that if I missed something? Stacy Rasgon : Okay, I'll use the follow up. So how are you parsing the quality of the orders that you're getting? Are you just skipping whatever is being ordered at this point? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, and I'm glad you I'm glad you chose that one as a follow up. I'll just highlight, as you know, we have moved away from distributors over the last couple years, really, it's been more of a 10 year process. But in the last few years, more, we pulled the trigger and actually no longer ship into too many distributors that we used to. And now we're going direct with, with a lot of our customers. To the point where, we exited last year with almost two thirds of our revenue, shipping direct, that has put us in a great position, particularly in the current environment. Because we have, we now have more direct access to those customers who have a better understanding of what they really need. We have, we don't have that intermediary in between frankly, clouding things up. As frankly as the way it happened a lot with the distributor. So, so then we use that information to better allocate our resources, both inventory, manufacturing, etcetera, in order to fulfill demand from our customers. Dave Pahl : That's great. Thank you, Stacy. Now we\u2019ll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And our next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon, guys. I think somebody asked the question, not original but a follow up to the June revenue guide. I'm just curious Rafael; you said did you would be growing supply sequentially from March to June. So the implication is, you might be able to build some inventory in your own balance sheet. I'm just curious, given how lean inventories are across the channel. Why would you wouldn't expect incremental supply that you bring on, not to be used by your customers and actually show sequential revenue growth? Rafael Lizardi : I think you're getting a little new ones in that question and picking some of the things I said. Just I would you, we drain inventory fourth to first, right? So even if we're increasing output, that doesn't necessarily mean that we'll be able to build inventory. What I said earlier, you shouldn't take that as a statement that we're going to build inventory going into second quarter. Rafael Lizardi : And I would add that we're going to add incremental inventory or incremental capacity through the balance of this year, and through the first half of this next year, until RFAB II comes on, which would be in the second half of 2022. So, you've got multiple pieces that are moving there. You have a follow on, John? John Pitzer : Yes. Just it was nice to see in the March quarter embedded at least sequentially, growing faster than analog. And we've talked about this in the past, Dave, about kind of the growth there is kind of lag that of analog, do you feel like within the embedded market, you're turning the corner on it? Can you help us kind of understand how you guys see the design funnel there? And what the growth rate in that market might be beyond kind of the cyclical recovery? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, I'll give you a few comments on that. And, Dave, you want to follow up. But high level, we're pleased with the trajectory of embedded. We're still -- however, we're still in very early phases, right? As we have said before, our goal with embedded was first to stabilize embedded, make some changes that we have made and then leverage our competitive advantages that we have to -- have embedded headed in a better direction. And we're in the early phases, but we're pleased with those early results. John Pitzer : Great. Thank you. Dave Pahl : Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Dave, thanks for the color on lead times. I guess, in the hotspots, maybe 20% or so that's been impacted? Can you just give a sense of what you're seeing there? And maybe your sense of when you would expect that the lead times in certain areas has to normalize? Dave Pahl : Yes. There's just a lot of moving pieces on that to correct that. I think it's probably premature to try to pick that. Our teams are obviously working very hard with customers to close those demand and fulfill those needs. So it really just based on technologies and packages and what those customer requirements are. You have a follow on? Craig Hettenbach : Sure. Thanks. And then, personal electronics, up 50%. Year-over-year, I know there's been some nice tailwinds from work from home. Any more color in terms of some of the segments that you're seeing growth? And how you feel about that business for Q2? Dave Pahl : Yes. So at a high level, what I'd say, we'll give color by end market, if there's something unusual going on. When we look out into a quarter, I can say that there's nothing unusual that we feel the need to call out. When we look back into first quarter, and really in the past few quarters in personal electronics, the demand that we've seen there has been very broad based, both by customer, really across the board that we've seen, as well as by sector. So -- and just as a reminder, in spite of personal electronics, we'll have things like handsets and tablets and personal computers, including laptops, televisions, smart speakers, those types of things. So it's a pretty broad category -- printers. So it's pretty broad categories. I think there is nine, ten different sectors that make up personal electronics. So -- and we've seen very strong demand across -- really across all of those. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. This is Rafael. I just want to go back to the question lead times. Earlier, several people asked about inventory. At the end of the day, things are going to be tied as long as demand is ahead of supply, things are going to be tied, lead times are going to be tied. But the key point here is we own our own manufacturing and technology, right? That is a key differentiator versus our competitors. It is one of our competitive advantages. So we are in a strategically -- in a unique strategic position to be able to have that control that inventory, be able to add to that capacity incrementally for the next year and a half or so. But then more significantly after that when RFAB II is built, and it starts to get equipped. So that's a big difference versus our competitors. It really puts us in a much better position to fulfill customer's demand, both short term and more importantly, over the long haul, as we continue to focus on industrial automotive, all those customers that are in those great spaces. Dave Pahl : Good color. Yes. Thank you. Okay. We'll go to the next caller. Please. Operator : Thank you. And that will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon, Thanks for answering my question. On the extended lead times maybe a different way to ask the question. You also asked about 20% of your wafer requirements, most of it is embedded and you outsource, 40% of your test and assembly. I'm just wondering if this is where you're seeing maybe more of the extended lead times just given the capacity as tight as your outsourced partners? Or is it across both internal and outsourced manufacturers? Dave Pahl : Yes. It's not specifically there, Harlan. It really is more just based on technology or end market driven or package types. So, we've described it as hotspots. So it's kind of a combination of those things when we've got demand that is outstripping the short term supply. But back to Rafael's point. The fact that we do the majority of that assembly test in-house, most of our peers don't do that. Most of our peers have that assembly outside. So even that 60%, 70% is a very large number that we control and do in-house. Also, because we do 80% of our wafers in-house, we can expand that capacity incrementally. Also, we control the cost to a much higher degrees than our peers as well. And those are very important things in times like these. So it\u2019s a tremendous advantage. On top of the fact that 300 millimeter, we're adding capacity. So it's coming in at structurally lower cost in addition to it. So, you have a follow on. Harlan Sur : Yes. No. Thanks for the insights there. So good again to see the year-over-year momentum in the embedded business. And I know somebody tried to ask a question about this previously, but wondering if you could just -- I know you guys refocus some of the sub segments within embedded last year. Just wondering if you guys could give us a profile of embedded relative to the overall corporate profile? I mean, does it have the same end market exposure as the overall business? Or is it more skewed now towards one or particular end markets? And on a go forward basis like what end markets within embedded are you spending more R&D dollars? Dave Pahl : Yes. So, I think that -- what the investments that we have in embedded, we have directed at the best growth opportunities. So, as we took a step back, we wanted to focus them into that direction. They are bias towards industrial and the automotive markets. The largest portion of our revenue are pointed in those two markets as well. We do have a little bit of revenue in communications enterprise and PE [ph] inside of that, but the majority of the revenue is in those two markets. So, again, as Rafael said, we're in the early stages. Our first objective was to get the revenue stabilized. So, we feel very good about the progress that we've made so far. And we're making the investments there because we believe embedded will be a great contributor to free cash flow growth over the long term. So, we believe that several years from now we'll look back and we'll be very pleased with the investments that we've made. We'll be very pleased with the free cash flow growth that embedded will have contributed to the company. So, okay. Thank you, Harlan. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. And that will come from Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you very much. Just a question on the order patterns that you're seeing guys. Many of your peers have talked about no cancellations policies, facets of the business we haven't seen in -- and you could say never. But are you think that that customers are looking for commitments to capacity, and then as a result, you're having to change your clauses with the customers in terms of cancellation policy, or what have you. Are there any changes on that front? Dave Pahl : Yes. So, we don't think that that's a good idea to go down that path to force customers to tell us what they need a year from now. I don't -- you can demand that they tell you what they need in April or May of 2022. But I can assure you, they don't know what they need a year from now. We really want to be in a position where we can supply them what they need, and be a supplier that they can count on as well. Our competitive advantage of manufacturing technology and owning controlling that our manufacturing asset also gives us control of our costs there. So we haven't been in a position where we've had to go in and raise prices as many of our other peers have. So -- and we believe that those two things combined are translating into share gains, right? So, when you look at the revenues in this quarter, we believe part of that is share gains. And I'll quickly also point out that. You got to measure that over time. So don't look at or measure it over just one quarter. But we do believe that will be something that will benefit us for a very long time to come. You have follow on, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes, I do. Just quickly on the capacity and CapEx. So, intensity, we shouldn't be modeling a different intensity over the next few quarters, correct? We should be within the guidance range that you've given as you build the third Fab? And then, is that second half 2022 a pull in versus what you were expecting? Rafael Lizardi : No, it's not a pull in. That's about where we've always expected. But now let me answer the first part of your question. As you as you know very well, you've been following us for a while. We talked about our guide for CapEx as percent of revenue at about 6%. We did that at the capital management strategy meeting. And that is -- that's a valid number over the long term. And it's just a model to help you think about our CapEx. But the reality is that in the short term for two, three years, we're going to run higher than that in absolute terms, and also the percent of revenue as we continue to invest both short term to get ahead of the current situation, but more importantly, longer term as we continue to strengthen our competitive advantage of having our own manufacturing technology, particularly 300 millimeter that as we talked about, provides such a great structural cost advantage in controlling our own manufacturing supply they've been is that early during this pandemic, and cycle has proven worthwhile. Dave Pahl : Okay, Thank you, Ambrish. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. And that question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Dave, I just -- I also wanted to ask about the guidance. I know there's some school of thought that because you control your supply chain, and that your model and inventory would sort of drive some share gains and some more upside given what's going on. And I know that you're typically conservative, and you have a very tough comp on Q1. But I wonder if maybe customers are not pulling your product because of shortages elsewhere? Because it just is, sitting there in consignment anyway, waiting for them? And I guess the question is, are you hearing that from any of your customers that they're not pulling due to shortages elsewhere? And maybe that's contributing somewhat to your June guidance? Rafael Lizardi : Tim, we think that that probably goes on at any point. Though, we don't believe that that's going on at any significant level. So yes, we don't believe that that's a significant factor that's going on in second quarter. You have follow on? Timothy Arcuri : Yes. I do. So I guess last, the same thing that I asked last quarter about the share repo. And I know that you guys always say that free cash flow only matters if it's returned. But you didn't buy back much again this quarter. It's like $130 million over the past nine months. And it's sort of seems like maybe a bit of a pattern now that it's three quarters in a row? So, and I know you have a pretty strong in trinsic value model for your stock. So can you just talk about that? Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, sure. No, thanks. First, stepping back, as you alluded to our goal, our objective is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company over the long term. And if you look at our 15, 16 year history on that front, we have been returning all free cash flow and then some to the owners of the company. And we're going to continue doing that over time. Now over time -- over the long term. That means --that doesn't necessarily mean every quarter, certainly not every quarter, maybe not even every year, right? But over the long term, we're going to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. We do that through both dividends and buybacks. And there are different criteria that we look at for each of those, and we've talked about that. Dave Pahl : Okay. We've got time for one more caller. Operator : Thank you. And that question will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you, and congratulations on the record revenues and earnings. First question. Dave or Rafael, could you just step back just looking at the last 90 days, what is it exactly that changed this last quarter? Did orders continue to accelerate? Does the capacity situation ease? Maybe just walk through exactly what changed? Rafael Lizardi : I'll give you a few comments. Not sure if I have -- perhaps what you're looking for. But demand continues to be strong. We're still in a environment where demand exceeds supply capacity. Now, of course, our revenue has continued growing in that environment, and both year-on-year clearly, but also sequentially, right? And we are incrementally adding capacity while we do that. We're also in the -- while we have done that we have over this entire cycle, we have focused on making the company stronger, right? So we have back, if you look at the first phase of this pandemic, back in February or March, when everybody was pulling back, we built through that cycle. So that was a tactical decision enabled by our strategic position of our focus on industrial automotive, on catalog part with low risk, obsolescence, so we're able to build through that cycle. And be prepared for the other side, once demand started returning pretty quickly as it turned out. We also -- as we did that we also gain a strategic ground, focusing on auto and industrial. So you've seen how we have grown in those phases. And while we have done that we have invested for the long term. And that's invested in competitive advantages, the most obvious one is manufacturing technology. We already talked about that here. But there's also our product portfolio, right? We continue to strengthen the R&D in the best basis. And then the other one is free to have channels, which we really haven't talked about today much. But we continue to strengthen that and may be the most obvious one is the other comp, and everything we're doing there to support our customers with very, very high availability, in fact, immediate availability in a lot of cases with many parts, that's inventory there for customers to buy direct from us on the other comp. Dave Pahl : You have a follow on, Tore? Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. So your operating margin, I think was just very shy of a record 45.2%. Rafael, in the past, you've talked about OpEx kind of being between 20% and 30% of revenue. Now that -- it's pretty obvious that there's so much demand out there and that it's sustainable. Is it safe to say that OpEx ratio is going to change going forward and maybe stay at 20% to 25%? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So what I will tell you on that is in the short term, we run OpEx on a trailing 12 month basis at about $3.2 billion. That's not going to change much in the short term, right? Because it doesn't need to. Right? We feel very good about those investments, we feel very good about where they're going. They're long term in nature. Clearly in R&D, but also, part of SG&A is, is, the telecom example, that's, we think of as an investment, of course, even those it\u2019s in SG&A. So we I don't see that number, in the short term changing much, but over the long term, over many years, the guidance that we have given you of 20% to 25% still apply. So, so you should still think of it in those terms. Rafael Lizardi : Okay, so I think that was the last one. So let me go ahead and wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously, that our core were engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and best metric to measure progress and generate long term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions; we will act like owners who will own the company for decades, we will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we're personally proud to be a part of and would want us our neighbour. And we're successful. Our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results, with more details than usual by end market, including some sequential performance since it's more informative at this time. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, some insight into one-time items and our guidance for the third quarter of 2021. Starting with a quick overview of the second quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $4.6 billion, an increase of 7% sequentially and 41% year-over-year, driven by strong demand in industrial, automotive and personal electronics. On a sequential basis, Analog grew 6% and Embedded Processing grew 2%. On a year-over-year basis, Analog grew 42% and Embedded grew 43%. Our Other segment grew 30% from the year-ago quarter. Moving on, given the current environment, again this quarter, I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by end market and comment on our lead times. First, the industrial market was up mid-teens sequentially and up about 40% from the year ago. The strength was seen across most sectors. The automotive market grew sequentially following a strong first quarter 2021 and more than doubled from a weak year-ago compare. Personal electronics was about even sequentially and up about 25% compared to a year ago. The strength was broad-based across sectors and customers within personal electronics. Next, communications equipment was up low-single digits sequentially and was down upper teens from the year ago. Enterprise systems grew upper teens sequentially and was about even from the year ago. Regarding lead times, the majority of our products continue to remain steady. However, the growing demand in the second quarter of 2021 again expanded our list of hot spots, which required extending some lead times. As planned, we continue to add incremental capacity in 2021 and first half of 2022 with additional support from the startup of our third 300-millimeter wafer fab, RFAB2, that will come online in the second half of 2022. As discussed during our Capital Management review in February, our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology delivers the benefits of lower cost and greater control of our supply chain, which really shows through in a market environment like this. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, second quarter revenue was $4.6 billion, up 41% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.1 billion, or 67% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 290 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $816 million, up 5% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 19% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.6 billion in R&D. Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $48 million in the second quarter and are related to the National Semiconductor acquisition. These acquisition charges will remain at about this level through the third quarter of 2021 and then go to zero. Operating profit was $2.2 billion in the quarter, or 48% of revenue. Operating profit was up 80% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.9 billion, or $2.05 per share, which included a $0.06 benefit that was not in our prior outlook, due to the signing of a royalty agreement. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $386 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.5 billion. In the quarter, we paid $942 million in dividends and repurchased $146 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $3.9 billion in the past 12 months. Over the same period, our dividend represented 56% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $7.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were down $34 million from the prior quarter and days were 111, which are below desired levels. In the second quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire Micron's 300-millimeter fab in Lehi, Utah. This investment continues to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology and is part of our long-term capacity planning. The Lehi fab will be our fourth 300-millimeter fab, joining DMOS6, RFAB1 and soon-to-be completed RFAB2 in our wafer fab manufacturing operations. We continue to believe that our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology will be of growing importance in owning and controlling our supply chain. For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.40 billion to $4.76 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.87 to $2.13. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 14%. In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Rafael and Dave, when I look at the last few quarters, your reported sales have been significantly above your guided range. And I mean, like between 5% to 13% above your original outlook and that\u2019s just making it very hard to distinguish right between how to read your guidance, because even now you\u2019re guiding to a flattish outlook and what suppose to be seasonally stronger quarter. Should we take that to be conservatism? Should we take that to be a peaking in the cycle? And how is that the demand is so strong? You\u2019re increasing supply, but yet your sales outlook is flattish. I think it's a very confusing message and I would love your insights into how to interpret your guidance. Are we reading them in the right way? Dave Pahl : Yes. Vivek, thanks. Thanks for the question. I think, first, I would say perhaps normal seasonal patterns may not be the best measure to look at things, in periods like this. Certainly, the last few quarters, we would all agree have been unusual period that we\u2019ve gone through and as we continue to move through. So, and as you said, the last few quarters have been exceptionally strong. Second quarter was certainly strong, both sequentially and year-over-year. So, if you look at our guidance, it would suggest that next quarter will again be a very strong quarter. So in, as you know, our guidance is the best estimate that we have at this time. So that's what we try to do and try to give you that insight. You have a follow on? Vivek Arya : Yes. Thanks, Dave. So from what you said, I assume that you are, again, implying conservatism unless you suggest otherwise. My real question is, when I look at the share buyback activity, it's been very low in the last few quarters. And there are only a few reasons why that would be, right? One is the simplest reason that maybe the stock is perhaps not attractive at these valuations, or it could be that you're preparing for some M&A, or is it some large CapEx or some caution about macro? And to -- trying to understand why is there such a material shift in terms of your return of free cash flow strategy, right? We understand the dividend part has been very strong, but the share buyback activity has been very low over the last almost a year now. So we just appreciate your views as to why you are not buying back your stock at the pace at which you have historically done so. Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : No, I\u2019m happy to address that one, Vivek. So first, let me take you back to how we think about cash return. And it's very well you follow us for many years. And you've heard us talk about this human capital management, a year in and year out. And our objective when it comes to cash returning to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. We do that through dividends as well as buybacks. Now that that has never meant and doesn't mean that every single quarter or even every single year where that return is going to be exactly 100%, right? If you look at our history, over 15-plus years, it has been actually above 100%. So that shows our commitment to that and that commitment has not changed. We are committed to returning all free cash flow to the owners of the company over time. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And the next caller will be Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had two as well. I guess, one, clarification, Dave. I think when you talked about automotive, you said up sequentially in the second quarter. Did I test that right? Did you not give a specific number of automotive? Dave Pahl : That's correct. It was up low single digits, Toshi. Toshiya Hari : Okay. Got it. Dave Pahl : Do you have follow-on? Yes. Toshiya Hari : Yes. So in terms of gross margins, I realize you guys don't run the business management business for gross margins. But clearly, you had a very, very strong quarter in Q2, and I know you don't guide gross margins going forward. But based on how you're thinking about utilization rates in your factories, given what you know about pricing in your business, both on the analogue side as well as the embedded side going forward? How are you thinking about gross margins and kind of the OpEx leverage going forward in your business? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. No, so first, let me emphasize a point you made. We do not focus on gross margins in how we run the business, just like you said. Our focus is on free cash flow generation. In fact, free cash flow per share, and how we can grow that over the long-term, right, because we think ultimately, that is what drives value for the owners of the company. And you can do that at 67% margin, you can do it at a lower margin, or you can do at a higher margin depends on a number of factors. So - and then to answer your specific question, as we have always guided, over the long-term, not only one quarter or even many one year, but over the long-term, 70% to 75% fall through is the right way to - generally speaking in the right way to look at to model the company as we go forward. So as you put whatever revenue expectation you have there and fall that through, what about that rate and you'll be in the ballpark. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Toshi. I will consider that two questions, if that's okay. And we'll move on to our next caller. Operator : And the next caller is going to be Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. So now you don't think about running the business to gross margins, but I'm going to ask a gross margin question anyways. And you were at 65.2. Obviously, you did very strongly with this quarter. But you said you had $0.06 of royalties that was unexpected. That should have been about 1.4 points of gross margins as I understand it, if I do the math, right? And then I think you had something like $50 million in Austin cost last quarter that should have rolled off this quarter. That would have been another 100 basis points, give or take. So I'm actually wondering why gross margins were -- in fact, if I take out the royalties, they would have been up 60 basis points only with 100 basis points of cost that should have rolled off with a massive revenue increase, like what's going on with what happened with gross margins in the current quarter given all of that? Rafael Lizardi : So, Stacy, I -- let me address one and then I have to ask your question. I don't quite understand part of your question, but \u2026 Stacy Rasgon : Or maybe royalties, working gross margin, maybe they weren\u2019t \u2026 Rafael Lizardi : Exactly, That\u2019s the part I did it. Okay. So you\u2019re assuming royalty? Stacy Rasgon : Okay. Rafael Lizardi : Okay. So let me address that first. We talk about royalty. It used to be in revenue and gross margin. But that was years ago, I think, three or four years ago. We -- yes, we moved that to other income and expense. So that is in that line, other income expenses. So it has nothing to do with margins. It has been for three or four years or so since we -- and the reason we moved that is very de minimis, it's a relatively small amount. It averages about $100 million a year. Of course, in the big scheme of things, given our revenue level is a relatively small amount, and we expect that to be continue to be small going forward. On the other part of your question. So last quarter, we had about a $50 million hit to our gross margins. That was because of the winter storm in Texas. We did talk about that during the call we mentioned and that was all in gross margin. So, yes, you can adjust that. You can -- you guys just, however, you wish for fourth quarter to get the gross margin without that impact, right? And that may make more sense when you look at the trends. Stacy Rasgon : Yes. Rafael Lizardi : Does that answer your question? Stacy Rasgon : Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : I think you have a second one, right? You still have a follow-up, or? Stacy Rasgon : So my follow-up, yes, you're guiding revenues flat, and you're guiding EPS down slightly. So either gross margins are going down or OpEx is going up. Although, I mean, normally optics, I think seasonably into Q3 would be down a few points. I guess on those are you expecting any sort of different OpEx trends into Q3 as you would normally see like in the normal Q3 is there something else going on because normally it's down sequentially? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. And well -- so the reason that EPS is moving at the midpoint is the royalty that we just talked about, right? So you just take out that $0.06 from the EPS that we just delivered. You get to a more normalized EPS without that royalty, and then compare that to the next quarter. And you'll see that there's nothing unusual there. We --, obviously we only give revenue and EPS range. But if there was something unusual in between the lines, we would point it out and there's nothing unusual. Nothing's changing much between the other lines, right, yep. Okay. Thank you, Stacy. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And next we have John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Dave and Rafael, I just want to go back to the revenue guidance, sort of flat at the midpoint with down sequentially. I guess I'm just trying to wrap my head around the fact that your deficiencies kind of increased in the June quarter, you said your hotspots went up? It sounds like demand is still relatively strong. And yet there's a part of your guidance that could be down sequentially, which I'm having a hard time grasping. Dave, maybe you can talk about end markets. Are there any end markets that particularly look like they're cooling off sequentially into the calendar third quarter? Or why the down sequential? I think I have to go back to see, quite a bit of time to see you guys have a flat to down sequential Q3. Dave Pahl : And John, when you say down sequentially, just to clarify, are you saying that part of our range would imply that it could be down and the other part would imply that it will be up. John Pitzer : Yes. Dave Pahl : That's what -- that\u2019s just to clarify that part of the question. I got you. Yes. So yes, John, if there's something that's unusual going on within an end market or region or product area, we've always provided insight into that, to help, understand, an outlook or even something that's happened in a current quarter. I'll just say that there's nothing unusual like that, that we feel that we would need to explain what's going on. I think that, as I mentioned earlier to Vivek's question on the topic, seasonality probably isn't the best thing to be looking at as we've been moving through the last few quarters. And I would say what that range implies, the revenue still will be -- will still be strong. So you've a follow on? John Pitzer : Yes, just as my follow on, on RFAB2, I'm just curious with the proposed purchase of Lehi, should we think about sort of the building going on as planned. The pilot line going on as planned, but capacity at RFAB2 kind of slowed or how do we think about kind of now your mix of capacity as Lehi comes in next year. And what that means for CapEx and the ramp of RFAB2? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. No, let me tell you about that. So first, let me step back remind everyone objective when it comes to CapEx is to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth. And specifically, extending our low cost manufacturing advantage, primarily 300-millimeter, right? So we\u2019ve talked about that for a long time and it's a core part of our strides. One of our competitive advantage is having that manufacturing and technology advantage. RFAB2 will be the third 300-millimeter factory. Lehi will be our fourth 300-millimeter factory. RFAB2 will become operational sometime in the middle of next year, that's when the shell will be completed and then we will be deploying equipment there. And then we're incurring CapEx because of that. So CapEx as I said at the last call, will be higher, both in absolute dollars and as percent of revenue because of that. And then on top of that, at Lehi right, which we didn't have last quarter when we had talked -- when we had the earnings call. So now Lehi is going to be on top of that. That's a $900 million purchase price, which will run through CapEx, but then in addition to that factory, it's ready for production once we qualify it, but at relatively low volumes. We still have to add CapEx at factory to take it to the volumes that we want and that will happen over time. And think of that CapEx is probably going to be -- is probably going to run about half of what RFAB2 CapEx will run. And I'm talking over years, right, as we deploy equipment there. And both of those will add to the strength or will strengthen our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology with two more 300-millimeter factories. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, John. And we will go to the next caller please. Operator : And that will be Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Blayne Curtis : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Actually I just want to ask on, I know you're not going to probably guide December, but just kind of any feel you can for that quarter. Obviously, seasonality has been out the window typically a down quarter. Just trying to get a better handle on the back half year obviously the flattening market, but at much higher levels. Anything you can throw out there for December? Dave Pahl : Yes, Blayne. And certainly, I know there's lots of speculations on how long the strong demand will last and certainly we've read the ranges that it's going to end soon and others that say it is going to continue for quite some time. And obviously as you stated, we are not going to forecast the fourth quarter or even comment on how long the cycle last, because honestly as you know, we don't know, I don't think anyone knows. But I think we can frame how the actions that we've taken and our approach as we've gone through the cycle. And in the first phase, you've seen us accelerate into the widely anticipated decline and that really enabled us to gain ground. And really, in the second phase, we're working to ensure that we gain strategic ground, particularly in industrial and automotive and that -- those gains will reward us for years to come. And independent of that, we are investing for the long-term. So some of the obvious things that you can see are the new manufacturing investments in RFAB2. If you're down here in Texas, you will see cranes up over the building. I think I counted six or seven at the max that were up over that. The additional Lehi, some of the less visible ones are the R&D investments and new capabilities at ti.com and those investments are continuing. So we won't -- we will go through cycles. We won't be able to predict it, but we can make the place stronger. We can continue to invest in our competitive advantages. So do you have follow-on? Blayne Curtis : Thanks. Yes, I just wanted to ask you on inventory levels. Obviously, way down at these sales levels on a days inventory, but your ability to grow that absolute amount and if you're able to do that in the September? Rafael Lizardi : I will start and Dave, you want to follow-up. But inventory levels, first, let me remind everyone the objective there, maintain high levels of customer satisfaction while minimizing obsolescence which frankly is not an issue given our business model. We are clearly below desired levels, just like we said during the prepared remarks, right. We are running about 111 days and our target is 130 to 190 days. That's part of the reason why we have the hotspots that we talked about. At the same time I will tell you, we go back to second quarter last year when the pandemic was starting, in fact, March of last year, everybody, all our competitors were decreasing their inventory levels, slowing down factories. We went the other way right. We maintained and in fact increased our production levels. We increased our inventory levels. They went from about 140 days to 160, some 170 days, almost. And that along with our business strategy, our business model helped to put us in a great position to take advantage of the situation and has helped us do significantly better than our competitors over the last three or four quarters, right. But we have gotten to a point where, yes, things are -- inventory is now below desired levels. We will continue to add incremental capacity as we have talked about, that is in all of our factories, especially RFAB1, but the next bigger tranche of capacity will come in with RFAB2 as we talked about earlier. Once that is operational sometime in the second quarter or next year, then that will -- that\u2019s when we finish and when we produce revenues sometime in the second half of next year, then that will add a significant amount of capacity and then shortly after that, Lehi will also come in line for additional revenue capacity there. Dave Pahl : Yes. And maybe just quickly, what I might add to that, obviously, whenever things do slow, we will then use that period of time to rebuild inventories in those positions to be able to support growth in the future, so. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. And I will just add one more thing. Both RFAB2 and Lehi, those are long-term play, right? These are -- this is to strengthen our manufacturing advantage, owning our own manufacturing, which clearly has proven over the last year and a half, we knew that already but it has proven that how important that is in the current environment. They are going to happen to help in the medium term, most likely, but if they don't, if things slow down and it doesn't work out that way that is completely fine with us. That's not why we are equipping those factor, that's not why we bought -- we're buying Lehi is for the long-term positioning of the company to support long-term revenue growth in both Analog and Embedded. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Blayne. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : And next we will go to Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you very much, Rafael and Dave. I had a question on free cash flow per share. And you guys know I don't look at it on a quarterly basis. So if I look at the last 2 years, if I look at 2020 free cash flow per share, down 3%. 2019 it was flat. And I know that if I look at this year on a trailing 12-month basis, it is up double-digit, but it has lagged -- sorry for the background noise it always happens when I\u2019m on a conference call. If I look at the trailing 12 months and then -- so that's in line with what you have said consistently. But should we expect this to come back to the double-digit on an annualized basis. What's the right way to think about the lag over the last 2 years and how should we think about it going forward? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, this is one -- most financial metrics are this way too, but if you want to look at this over the long-term, right, any one quarter or even any one year, they could be a little choppy. You mentioned a couple of years when 2019 and even 2020 where that trajectory does not represent the longer term. And arguably the same thing for 2021 or the trailing 12 months number that you just quoted, right. So if you want to look at this over the long-term, and that's how we look at it, and that's what's going to ultimately drive value for the owners of the company, right. Ambrish Srivastava : Okay. That\u2019s fair. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow on, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes, I did. With all the tightness and contrast this with the way you guys have managed the business, and the share shift probably show up that quickly because these designs are such long lasting and they don't change on a dime. Are you seeing any discernible change in your design in activity as a result of what we've seen from your peers with the tightness and you managing your lead times and inventory much better than some of your peers? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes, I will start off and Rafael if you want to add. I would say that as you know, Ambrish, we have started on the journey to have closer direct relationships with customers really 8 -- 7, 8 years ago with our investments on ti.com, investments in our sales, applications teams, investments in processes and how we do business and just our structure inside of the company. And last year, you saw a pretty major step of taking more customers direct and operating with fewer distributors as well as transacting business through ti.com. So you kind of mix that together with the pandemic c and our ability to do virtual sales calls. I think all those things have positioned us well strategically, especially in markets like industrial, automotive, those markets where we want to gain that strategic ground. You couple that with availability and like you say things don't move quickly, but the supply shortages really started showing up in the beginning of 2020 took a break in the first or second quarter, when the pandemic hit and then reaccelerated after that. So there are cases that are unusual, but there are cases where customers redesign boards just because of availability. I will describe that as an outlier. But we do see cases of that, but we see more cases where you have designs that are being intersected as they come through. And again, our sales teams are engaged from production all the way back into engineering and that gives that visibility is a great strategic advantage and those benefits again will be things that will pay rewards for us for a long time to come. Okay. Thank you, Ambrish. And I think we've got time for one last caller. Operator : And that caller will be Chris Danely of Citigroup. Christopher Danely : Thanks guys. Hey, Dave, by the way thanks for the other analysts go first and beat you up on the flat guidance. So I don't have to. My question is on the auto revenue. So if we look at the headlines and talk to the folks in the auto supply chain, there's still a lot of shortages etcetera, etcetera out there. And I think your revenue was only slightly up. So can you just explain the discrepancy? It seems like it would be up a little bit more than that if there's all these folks clamoring for parts out there? Dave Pahl : Well, I would point out it over doubled from a year-ago, Chris. So it's a little bit more than up a little bit and I think you're pointing to the sequential. But again, last quarter it was up over 25% from pre-pandemic levels. I don't think we are shipping 25% more cars from pre-pandemic levels, right. So our shipments into automotive are up and up significantly, and we continue to add capacity and continue to -- we believe we are gaining share there as well. You got to measure it over time. But, yes, so we are -- our shipments are up there and up strong. So you have a follow-on? Christopher Danely : Yes. Just, I guess the hotspot question. So you said that you're seeing a few more hotspots last quarter. Do you think that the situation gets a little bit worse this quarter or do you think it gets better? When do you guys think you'll start to get a handle on all these sort of supply issues out there I guess? Rafael Lizardi : Chris, it's going to depend on demand, right. We are on the supply side, as we said, we are adding capacity incrementally. We have been and we will continue to do that. The bigger tranche of capacity doesn't come in until about a year from now right as we just talked about, RFAB2 and then 6 months later we've Lehi. So it will be a while before we\u2019ve big tranches of capacity coming online. So it's going to depend on demand. At the end of the day, we don't fully control there. It is more of a macro situation, but we are better prepared than our peers and have been in both the tactical decisions we have made during the pandemic, but more importantly, our business model and how we run the company, specifically own in our own manufacturing that there has been a key in this whole process and we are just really doubling down on that. We\u2019ve -- what we were doing with all those factories that we just talked about. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Chris. Rafael do you want up first? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. I will go ahead and wrap up. So let me just emphasize what we have said previously. At our core, we are engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing and we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When where successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call.

I would like to turn the conference over to A - Dave Pahl. Please go ahead. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon. And thank you for joining our Third Quarter 2021, Earnings Conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti. com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations.  We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our Chief Financial Officer, A - Rafael Lizardi, is with me today and will provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into third quarter revenue results, with some details of what we're seeing in respect to the customers and markets. And I'll also provide details by end market, including some sequential performance as we have the last few quarters. As sequential data begins to be less insightful, we'll move back to reporting only year-over-year per our normal practice.  And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, an update of our capacity expansion plans and our guidance for fourth quarter of 2021. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter, revenue in the quarter was $4.6 billion, an increase of 1% sequentially and 22% year-over-year driven by demand in industrial, automotive, and personal electronics. On a sequential basis, analog grew 2% embedded processing declined 5% on a year-over-year basis, analog revenue grew 24% and embedded processing grew 13%, our other segment grew 19% from the year-ago quarter.  Now let me comment on the current environment to provide some context of what we're seeing with our customers and markets. Overall, the quarter came in generally as we expected across the product segments and markets and geographies. Lead times for the majority of our products remained stable, but hotspots continued to exist.  However, customers are becoming more selective in them expedite requests, focusing on products that complete a matched set rather than expediting products across the board. This behavior is not specific to any product family and market, or geography.  Discussions with customers confirm a high-level interest in our commitment to expanding our internal manufacturing capacity roadmap, including 300-millimeter wafer fabs, our Fab-2 and Lehi, or what we call LFAB, and the associated assembly test expansions. These investments to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage will provide lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.  And while there is a growing recognition that the near-term supply demand imbalance will end at some point, the secular growth of semiconductor content per system will continue to grow, and this requires a robust manufacturing capacity roadmap for 2025, and beyond. Moving on, I'll provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by end market. First, the industrial market was down mid-single-digits sequentially, and up about 40% from a year ago.  The changes both sequentially and from the year-ago were generally consistent across the diverse set of sectors. The automotive market again grew sequentially, and was up more than 20% from the year-ago. When comparing to pre -pandemic levels of Q4 2019, revenue is up almost 30%. Personal electronics grew low double-digit sequentially, and was up low double-digits compared to a year ago. The strength sequentially and the year-ago was due to mobile phones, PC notebooks, and tablets. Next, communications equipment was down mid-single digits sequentially, and was down upper teens from a year ago. Enterprise systems grew sequentially and from the year-ago quarter. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, third quarter revenue was $4.6 billion, up 22% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.2 billion or 68% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 360 basis points.  Operating expenses in the quarter were $800 million, up 1% from a year ago, and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 18% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.6 billion in R&D.  Acquisition charges and non-cash expense were $47 million in the third quarter and we will go to 0 beginning fourth quarter of 2021. Operating profit was $2.3 billion in the quarter or 50% of revenue. Operating profit was up 43% from the year-ago quarter. Net Income in the third quarter was $1.9 billion or $2.07 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $486 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $7.1 billion.  In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 13% effective this month, marking our 18th consecutive year of dividend increases. In the quarter, we pay $942 million in dividends and repurchased a $139 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $4.2 billion in the past 12 months. Over the same period, our dividend represented 53% of free cash flow underscoring its sustainability.  Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.8 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. In the quarter we've issued $1.5 billion of debt in 3 tranches of $500 million each. The first has a coupon of 1.125%, which is doing 5 years, the second at 1.9% due in 10 years, and the last at 2.7% due in 30 years.  This resulted in total debt of $7.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.6%. Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were up $7 million from the prior quarter, and days were 112, up 1 day sequentially, but still below desired levels. For the fourth quarter we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.22 billion to $4.58 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of a $1.83 to $2.07.  The Lehi acquisition closed last Friday, but the costs are not included in our guidance. We will provide those details when we report fourth quarter results. Just as a reminder, the purchase price was about $900 million, and we expect ongoing cost of about $75 million per quarter through 2022.  We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate for 2021, to be about 14% and our effective tax rate to be about 13%. As you're looking at your models for 2022, without any changes to taxable, we would expect our annual operating and effective tax rates to remain about what they are this year.  With a similar quarterly profile of discrete tax benefits that are higher in the first quarter compared to the rest of the year. In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger. Our investments in our long-term roadmap for capacity expansion, both in L-Fab and R-Fab-2, are great examples. As a remainder, our capex will be higher on an absolute level, as well as a percentage of revenue as we strengthen this advantage.  We are working through detailed plans of our long-term roadmap and we'll have specifics of timing in capex spending in our capital management goal in February. We continue to believe owning and controlling our supply chain will be of growing strategic importance. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question after our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll pause just a moment to let when an opportunity to signal for questions. And we will go first to John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave, I know in this sort of environment seasonality doesn't make a lot of sense, but when you look at the September quarter, I'm just kind of curious. The June quarter came in well above your guidance range. September was well above the midpoint, but still within the guidance range. We're hearing of logistical constraints and supply constraints across the economy.  I'm curious when you look at the lower level upside in the September quarter versus the June quarter. To what extent might have there been supply constraints outside of your control? To what extent do you think its customers just being more selective about what they're pulling from you? Any color there would be helpful. Dave Pahl : Sure, John, and thanks for the question. Yeah, I really think it depends on the customer's bill of material. I think that there are supply constraints that are widely reported across the different, different components.  And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the behavior that we're seeing the different. Our customers are showing up and requesting -- we have meetings with them, rather than showing up with long lists of devices that they're asking us to expedite.  They're really just short lists, so they're looking for particular parts that complete those matched sets so that they can complete those builds for them. It is a different behavior that we're seeing this quarter versus the prior quarters. So follow-on? John Pitzer : As a follow-on, I know you're going to give us more color about ELFAD expenses and RFAB's expenses as we get into next year. But I'm wondering if. Can you just help us set the stage a little bit next year is obviously going to be kind of a capacity build-out year for you?  And, I guess, all else being equal, how should we think about the gross margin impact on calendar year '22, as you layer in these investments? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. I'll take that one. First, as you know, you've known us for a long time. We don't manage the business due to gross margins. We manage for the long-term growth of free cash flow per share, and that's stars we've driving the top line, and that's why we're making this investment, to support revenue growth.  And as we do that is extending our low-cost manufacturing advantage that gives us that great structural cost advantage with 300 millimeters. Any addition to that, we're controlling the supply chain. And specifically, on your question, I think RFAB2, all in, that's about a $6 billion expense, about a billion of that is a building which depreciates over 30 years or so.  The balance of the rest is equipment and we're going to be putting in that equipment starting next year and over the coming years. With LFAB, obviously a 900 million purchase price. And some of that is building, some of that is equipment.  And then on top of that, we'll put about $3 billion of capex over a number of years as we ramp that up. So, we'll give you additional details on that and a bigger longer-term picture of how we're going to support the longer-term growth. We'll give you those details in February of the capital management gulf. John Pitzer : Okay. Thank you. Dave Pahl : Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : And we'll go next to Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Hi, thanks. Rafael, I was wondering if you could talk about pricing. Obviously, you're seeing some increases in your input costs. Can you talk about whether you're passing those onto customers and how ubiquitous any price increases on your side might be? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. What I would tell you, our strategy in pricing has not changed, we regularly monitor that. And our goal is to be competitive and it's really frankly independent of the input cost to the largest degree. But our goal is to be competitive and if prices move higher we're just as overdone, and we have been adjusting those overdone. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-up, Tim? Timothy Arcuri : I did, Dave. Thanks. And I guess I'll ask the same question that I've asked the last I think three calls about share repo, it was pretty low again. I guess is there a sort of -- can you help us think through maybe what the triggers might be for you to start to buyback more stock? Is there a target cash level where maybe you would say that the Balance Sheet is getting a little bit over capitalized and you'd start to buy back more stock? I'm just kind of -- obviously you're not buying back much, but I'm just kind of wondering if you could talk us through what triggers you might be looking for to start that back again. Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, stepping back and just to remind everybody how we think about our returns, our objective is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the Company over the long term. And we do that through dividends and buyback. You look at our 18-year history on that and is really consistent. In fact, we've, many years -- most years, we've averaged well over 100% of return.  During that time, we have, I would remind you we have increased the proportion of the return that comes into dividends. So that also plays into that. But as long as we think the buybacks are creative to long-term owners, we're going to have some buybacks.  And as you have seen, as you pointed out, the last 3 quarters we have. In fact, I don't think there's been a single quarter in the last 18 years or so that we have not purchased the return cash through the owners through buybacks in one form or another. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Tim. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll go next to Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. On finished goods inventory, most of which I assume is sitting at customer consignment hubs, this has come down faster than overall inventories. Finished goods dropped 8% sequentially in Q3, dropped 9% in Q2. They're down 25% from the beginning of this year, and down 33% pre-COVID-19, I assume due to the strong demand profile from your direct customers.  So how far below normal are consigning inventories relative to your customers target levels? And is part of the muted Q4 outlook to replenish these regular inventories or does the demand profile backlog and forecast actually reflect a sequential decline here in the fourth quarter? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. So, I'll start and Dave, you want to chime in after that, but I think where you're going with that -- let me make a step back. Obviously, inventory levels are below desired levels. We're at 112 days, our target is 130-190 days. So clearly, we're well below where we want to be. And inside of that as you pointed out finished goods -- all finished goods, whether it's in consignment or at our product distribution centers, are the ones that are decreasing most.  In fact, even though inventory -- total inventory levels stayed above flat slightly up second to third quarter, finished goods decreased and then whip and raw materials increased a little bit to offset that. Our goal, as soon as capacity increases if there's an adjustment in demand, we will build those inventory levels back up to be at more healthy levels.  And given our business model, it's just a great bet, just given the low obsolescence of our inventory, the diversity of positions, diversity of products that we can afford. Not only we can afford, it makes sense for us to build that inventory, have it ready for the secular growth that we're confident will happen beyond that. And I think, you're going on consignment inventory, frankly, those tend to be pretty lean to begin with.  That's how that process is designed, to just keep a couple weeks, so I wouldn't expect that, by itself, to build significantly. Pure consignment, where I would expect the build to happen at more of our product distribution centers. And that gives us more flexibility to then ship where the demand is most needed. Dave Pahl : Yeah. I think that's well said. I think just tactically where we -- whether we keep it in our hubs where we would prefer it, or if we push it out to a consignment center, that'll just be reflective of our expectation that our customer will pull it.  That's just a tactical decision. I'd also point out that, as you said, Rafael, we do plan to bring on more capacity incrementally, as we have each quarter through this year and through the middle of next year, and in the back half of 2022, RFAB2 will come online and then that'll be followed by LFAB since as Rafael pointed out, we did close on that factory on Friday of last week. And so that is on target to come online in early 2023 to support growth in the future. Did you have a follow-up, Harlan? Harlan Sur : Yes. Thanks. I appreciate the insightful answer. So, exiting last year, the direct business, which includes consignment that was about 65% of revenues. Where does that mix roughly sit today and did the team drive a positive book-to-bill ratio in Q3, if you could maybe quantify? Rafael Lizardi : So, on the book-to-bill, we don't think that's relevant, frankly, and we haven't disclosed that in a while, and we're not disclosing that anymore. On your first question on percent, I think you asked percent of our revenue from consignment, is that right? Harlan Sur : I didn't quite -- Yeah, that's the first part. Dave Pahl : Yeah. Could you just repeat it, Harlan, so we got -- make sure we got it right what you're asking, the first question? Harlan, are you there? Harlan Sur : Yeah, just percentage of the overall direct business. Dave Pahl : Oh, direct business, yes. We left last year with about the 2/3 of our revenues direct. So, we expected that percentage will increase over time. We'll provide an update of what we've done with that this year in our February call, cap management, the call in February of actually what that looks like. But just to say, over time, that we do expect that that will move up slightly over time.  And just the other caller with Rafael talking about book-to-bill. As we've got a lot of our revenue on consignment, we've got ti.com, the actual backlog isn't quite as meaningful as what it used to be. So, as he said, it's just not a number that we look at or measure or we've talked about in some time. So, it isn't quite as helpful as what it used to be. So, thank you, Harlan, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And we'll go next to Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For the first one I wanted to ask you about the near-term micron impact. I know you said $75 million in cost impact in the model next year. Those costs don't go away, right? That $75 million a quarter is people, correct? And does it include the [ inaudible 00 :22:36] or anything else because if its people does it -- how do you think about that like what that incremental costs long term? Rafael Lizardi : Very good, Stacy. Good direct question. So yes, that $75 million is mainly people and direct costs, not depreciation. Depreciation will not start until about first quarter of '23 when we start production just the way the rules work on that front.  And that 75 million that might -- we're still working through the details, but we currently believe that the most likely scenario is that most of that cost will go through its restructuring charges / other line until we start production, right? And that Boeing, the majority of their costs would go to the line.  Now, the costs actually doing pretty is over time as we increased production, right? But I think where you're going is that that happens and those scores, dose plus our then absorbed by revenue. Now, how quick we also are absorbed beyond on the utilization, etc., that just depends how quickly we we've rammed that factory. Clearly, at the beginning there won't be a 100% absorption and we will get to that at some point, but we'll -- we're not going to in 2023.  So, we'll get to that at some point to give you some details. And in February of the capital management call, I think we'll frame it kind of a bigger picture of that along with our other capex investments, and you get a better sense of how that's going to play out. Dave Pahl : A follow-on Stacy? Operator : And it looks like Stacy has disconnected. Dave Pahl : Okay. Rafael Lizardi : All right. Dave Pahl : Okay. If you have a follow-on, let us know, Stacy. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And we'll go next to Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Hey guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave and Rafael, I want to talk about the [ inaudible 00 :24:30] you reported and get into some of the supply demand dynamics. It was the smallest beat to your original revenue guidance, you guys have had in a year.  And I realize that it's been exceedingly volatile in the last year, but I wondered, was that the demand profile changing from those investors, that selectivity changing that you're talking about? Or did supply play a role in there where you just couldn't meet up to the demand? Just trying to get what really changed versus whatever level of conservatism you had built into the prior quarters when you beat by bigger deltas. Dave Pahl : Yes. I think you said demand from investors, I think you meant to say demand from customers, is its right Ron? Ross Seymore : Sorry about that. Dave Pahl : That's okay. Certainly, if any investors want to buy semiconductors from us, we'll be happy to sell them, but yes, I'd just say that overall, the quarter came in as we expected it to, right? And that's a statement as we said in the prepared remarks and we looked across geographies and products and product groups and end markets, those types of cuts, so there wasn't like one area that was underperformed or outperformed what we were expecting. But again, the main thing of what was different this Quarter versus Dave Pahl : last quarter was really where customers are coming in and requesting expedites and upsides from us, and those upsides were much, much narrower and more focused just on a few products. so that was really what the difference was.  If you're looking for what was different this quarter versus last quarter and those types of things, that's what I would point to say what's changed in the last 90 days. Ross Seymore : Thanks for the help on that. This is my follow-up, a similarly toned question. You mentioned that lead times remain extended but are stable, and then you talked about that whole selectivity dynamic. What would you imagine would change the lead times? is it going to be your supply incrementally rising or more so with Lehi or is the selectivity something as you guys look back and are students of cycles, is the demand side and that selectivity side more likely to impact the lead times going forward? Dave Pahl : Well, as you know, you've been through many cycles with us, right? It's always a combination of both. And we will and continue to add the incremental capacity, as we have planned for some time. And certainly, as we go out in time, as we get the bigger tranches of capacity coming on with RFAB2 and then LFAB, we'll be able to make more progress on that front.  And at some point, we know that things will change from a demand standpoint. so, we don't spend time trying to predict that, but we'll be ready for it, we know what we'll want to do, and as Rafael talked about, one of the top things there is we'll want to rebuild inventory to prepare for the next time that the demand strengthens. We have a long list of things that we're doing to invest in the Company to make it stronger. We won't control the timing of that, but we'll be ready very for it, for sure. Rafael Lizardi : And just to emphasize that point, when that adjustment happens, whenever that is, we will continue investing in R&D, focus on the areas, the auto and industrial for the secular long-term growth. We'll continue to invest on CapEx, and to set up the Company for the next 10-15 years, we've a great long-term roadmap and we will build inventory that's what as Dave has mentioned.  Our range is a 130-190 days, frankly, we'll probably end up being at the higher end of that range just because we feel so good about the business model and how good that inventory will be, and how it sets us up for the next upturn on the other side, given the long-lived nature of that in the north. Dave Pahl : That's right. Yeah. Okay. Thank you, Ross. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : We'll go next to Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I just want to get the supply side right. Are customers not ordering as much from you because they don't have enough from you on the component side, or they don't have enough from others that they need to complete the building materials? Dave Pahl : It's both, Vivek. There's -- there are instances of both of those and sometimes it's not even semiconductors, it's the -- may be other components that they may be missing. Yeah, it's a combination of those things. Supply chains are complex. It depends on the building materials and the systems that they're building. So, it depends. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, and the nuance changes, 90 days ago, 180 days ago, they were expanding everything, almost regardless of matched set position. Now, they are more selective in what they're expediting, right? Dave Pahl : You have a follow-on, Vivek? Vivek Arya : Yes. Thank you. Could you talk specifically to the automotive market. This year it's clear the production has not been not that strong, but auto semiconductor sales have been pretty strong. So, as it applies to TI, what do you think has been the interplay between content and mix? Or do you think that there is perhaps inventory stuck in the automotive supply chain somewhere that we should watch out for? Dave Pahl : I'll comment on automotive, I think I'll even extend it into industrial. Those are two markets that we have long talked about that we believe that there is content growth in those markets, content per system. It's easy to sit in cars and well reported on. I know, Vek, in your reports that you've reported on that, the content growth, you can see it in automotive, it's happening in industrial across 13 different sectors, so harder and harder to see.  And we invest in all the markets, but we have a strategic focus on automotive and industrial, so you're beginning to see some of the benefits of that strategic bias that we have. Our channel advantages, the breadth of our products, advantages in those markets as well. So, there's components of that. But that said, anytime that we have supply shortages in the industry, customer behavior is always very consistent and that behavior is that they will want to build inventory to protect themselves. Whether they've already begun that or have already done that, they certainly will want to do that, and at some point, they'll have too much product and that's what creates the cycles in us Dave Pahl : industry. It won't surprise us if the cycle comes to an end at some point, we'll be prepared for that and we'll know what we'll want to do at that point. Thank you for those questions and we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : We'll go to Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk to the hotspots. Is there any particular pattern that's driving which products you have in short supply? And it seems like we see at most in areas like enterprise and some of the personal electronics, higher volume stuff. Is that something that you guys would agree with and do you think is it -- is there more foundry versus internal fabs, is there anything in particularly driving those hotspots? Dave Pahl : Yeah. I wouldn't put it down on any one thing, Joe. Certainly, there's reports of the tightness across boundaries, so obviously we see that as well. There's tightness in some lead frames, so we see that as well.  Other input, raw materials, more compounds that we have testers, in some cases, some process technologies, some particular products themselves that have a large number of customers so in those thoughts move around as our operations teams will sometimes move capacity from one area to the other. So, they're not always consistent or persistent. Sometimes they are, but sometimes they're not and there's things that we can do to mitigate those or actually completely alleviate them. And that's why as we describe them, it's not just one particular product area or one particular product set that -- or even one particular market, or even -- I'd say even one particular customer that would be impacted by that you may see. Rafael Lizardi : And just to highlight something for maybe new listeners. Dave mentioned the foundries, only about 20% of our wafers are -- come from foundries. The vast majority, 80% and growing, we've had investments in 300-millimeter are internal wafers, and that just gives us much better control of our destiny. And for all the reasons they've mentioned, and then the low cost -- the structural low cost that we get with 300-millimeter. Dave Pahl : Yeah, I think that makes it especially clear why we believe that continues to be a strategic advantage for us in times like this. You have a follow-on, Joe? Joe Moore : Yeah, I wonder, also with the hotspots, is there a situation where you can't respond to upside in demand and that's why it's tight, or are there actual areas where -- I know there's always a little bit of this, but on a broad scale where you're not meeting commitments that you would made because of some of those things that are upstream from you. Dave Pahl : I think there's probably both of those that exists. Rafael Lizardi : At 112 days of inventory, it is harder to the respond to upside than if we were at 150, 160, 190 days, of course, so yeah. Dave Pahl : Yes. Yes. For sure. So okay. Well, thank you, Joe. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And our next question comes from Christine Lee of Citi. Christine Lee : Hey, thanks, guys. So, Dave and Raphael you mentioned that the lead times haven't really changed, but expedites are getting better or less bad. Why do you think that is? Do you think that, now your competitors are reducing lead times? Do you think that the supply chain has had a little bit of a chance to build some buffer inventory? What do you think the situation is getting I guess either better or less bad? Dave Pahl : Yes. Chris, I think that's a great question. I don't know that we know the answer, specifically, to that question, so I think we're trying to stick to the fact of we can observe that behavior change, I think you're offering some good theories of why that behavior may be changing, but what we're trying to do is to stick to the facts of what's going on.  There\u2019re multiple reasons why it might be changing, and we'd rather not venture into guessing or predicting or calling what's driving that behavior. So, do you have a follow-on? Christine Lee : Yeah. I guess you can leave the guessing and predicting up to sell - siders. On the -- since you guys don't talk about gross margin, but you do talk about free cash flow margin, I think you hit an all-time high in free cash flow margin in Q3, and it looks like there's some headwinds coming down the pipe I guess near to medium-term. Is there any reason for us to believe that you've seen your all-time peak in free cash flow margin or eventually could it get back above where it was in the most recent quarter? Rafael Lizardi : I'll take that, Chris. And Chris, you know us very well. You follow us for a long time. You know we do not manage to free cash flow margin per cent, right? That are not what drives long-term value for the owners if the long-term growth of free cash flow dollars. And to your point, there, there are some headwinds on that with the capex that we're talking about to set up the Company well for the future.  But of course, we're only doing that because we think that is going to drive even faster growth of the long-term trend of free cash flow dollars. So, we'll continue to focus on that because we think that is -- that is what drives value for the long-term owners. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Chris and we've got time for one more call. Operator : And we'll go to [Indiscernible] Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Thank you for squeezing me in. As far as the question on controlling the supply chain, you talked about 80% outsourced now. I believe that's the more advanced nodes, but should we assume that that 80% is just going to grow and that you're going to rely less and less on foundries going forward? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So, you said 80 outsources, it's 80 in-source just to make sure, 80% Unidentified Analyst : Sort of rationale Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. So, 80% our own wafers. And yeah, that should grow over time as we continue to add these wafer fabs that we're talking about, all in 300 millimeters, which -- the efficiency of 300 millimeter is huge because 300-millimeter wafer accounts for almost 2.3 times 200-millimeter wafer, and these are pretty large wafers where efficiency purposes. In fact, RFAB2 is going to be bigger than RFAB1. So, it's reasonable to deduce that that percent will increase over time. Unidentified Analyst : Very good. And as a follow-up, and I don't want to steal your thunder from February, but in the past, you\u2019ve talked about capacity of $22 billion. Obviously, you're going to go through capacity expansion here for the next 12 months to 18 months. Would you share any new numbers with those, I don't know, 25, 28, anything at all? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. No, so great question. Thanks for the setup for February. We will talk about that in February. Until then, what I would tell you is you've heard us talk about DMOS6 and our RFAB1. Roughly, that's the potential of about $8 billion of annual revenue on 300-millimeter than RFAB2. And this is all depending -- highly dependent on mix.  So, these are not affected numbers, but RFAB2, with that capex, RFAB2 should add another $5 billion of annual revenue, again, when it's full week web price or not, obviously not on day 1. And Lehi should add 3 billion to 4 billion of annual revenue.  So, we're thinking in terms of that, and we're thinking even beyond that. Because as we look at the Company's potential for growth into the next 10 and 15 years, then we're not stopping, just thinking in the next 4 or 5 years, we're thinking 10, 15 years. And we'll talk about that in February in more detail. Dave Pahl : That's great. And I think we can go ahead and wrap up Rafael can you have the mic. Rafael Lizardi : Okay. Let me wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers, and technology's the foundation of our Company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash over share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners, we will own the Company for decades.  We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing and we will be a Company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When we're successful, our employees, customers, communities, and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call for our capital management update on February 3rd at 10 AM Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insight into our business and our approach to capital allocation. For today's call, let me summarize what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll start with fourth quarter revenue results, including some details of what we're seeing with respect to our customers and markets. I'll then provide the annual summary of revenue breakout by end markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, some insights into one-time items and our guidance for first quarter 2022. Starting with fourth quarter results and the market environment. The company's revenue grew 19% year-over-year, driven by strong demand in the industrial and automotive markets. Analog revenue grew 20% year-over-year, and embedded processing grew 6%, our other segment grew 35% from the year-ago quarter. Let me now comment on the current environment to provide some context of what we're seeing with our customers and markets. Overall, the quarter came in stronger than we expected. The strength was across most product families, end markets and geographies. The market environment is similar to what we reported 90 days ago. Lead times for the majority of our products remained stable, but hotspots continue to exist. However, customers continue to be selective in their expedite requests, increasingly focusing on products that complete a matched set rather than expediting products across the board. This behavior is not specific to any product family, end market or geography. Discussions with customers confirm a high level of interest in our commitment to expanding our internal manufacturing capacity road map, including 300-millimeter wafer fabs; RFAB2 and LFAB; our recently announced plans for a multi-fab site in Sherman, Texas; and the associated assembly test expansions. These investments, to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage, will provide lower cost and greater control of our supply chain. And while there is a growing recognition that the near-term supply/demand imbalance will end at some point, the secular growth of semiconductor content per system will continue to increase, and this requires a robust manufacturing capacity road map for 2025 and beyond. Moving on, I'll now provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market for the year-ago quarter. First, the industrial market was up about 40%, driven by broad-based strength across all sectors. The automotive market was up high single-digits with strength in most sectors. Personal electronics was down upper single-digits, off a strong compare from a year ago. Next, communications equipment was up about 25%. Finally, Enterprise Systems was up about 50% off a weak compare from a year ago, driven primarily by data center and enterprise computing. And lastly, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2021. We break our end markets into six categories that are grouped by their life cycles and market characteristics. The six end markets are : industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for the year, industrial was 41%; automotive, 21%; personal electronics, 24%; Communications Equipment, 6%; Enterprise Systems, 6%; and Other was 2%. In 2021, industrial and automotive combined made up 62% of TI's revenue, up about 5 percentage points from 2020 and up from 42% from 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers promisingly turning to analog and embedded technology to make their end products smarter, safer, more connected and more efficient. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content for application, which will drive faster growth compared to the other markets. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.4 billion or 69% of revenue. From a year-ago, gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 440 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $793 million, up 1% from a year-ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 18% of revenue. For the year, we have invested $1.6 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long-term. Restructuring charges were $54 million in the quarter. This expense is driven by the Lehi wafer fab purchase we closed in October. Operating profit was $2.5 billion or 52% of revenue. Operating profit was up 38% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter was $2.1 billion or $2.27 per share, which included a $0.04 cost that was not in our prior outlook, primarily due to the purchase I discussed earlier. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.3 billion in the quarter, which included about $900 million for the LFAB purchase. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.3 billion, up 15% from a year ago. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends. We have increased our dividend per share by 13%, marking our 18th year of dividend increases. For the year, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.7 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was $7.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.6%. Inventory days were 116, up 4 days sequentially and remained below these higher levels. Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2021, cash flow from operations was $8.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $2.5 billion or 13% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2021 was $6.3 billion or 34% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.9 billion and earnings per share in the range of $2.01 to $2.29. We expect our 2022 annual operating tax rate to continue to be above 14% and our effective tax rate about 1 percentage point lower than that. This is based on current tax law and would be about the same as we saw in 2021. Next, let me help you model our expectation for expenses for the LFAB purchase. As we have said, we expect to have about $75 million of cost per quarter until we start production, which is still expected in early 2023. These costs continue to be mostly reflected in the restructuring line on the P& L, so it will be visible each quarter to you and therefore, part of our operating profit results. Once the facility begins production, this cost will move and be primarily reflected in cost of revenue. As I close, let me explain why we're so excited about this capacity investments as they strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage. First, we have significant 300-millimeter capacity coming online with RFAB2 and LFAB in 2022 and 2023. Second, with the announcement of the Sherman Complex, we have a 300-millimeter road map to support growth from 2025 to 2035. Third, customers are excited that our capacity investments are in 45-nanometer to 130-nanometer process technologies that are optimized for analog and embedded and will support their growth in the decades ahead. It is clear that owning and controlling our manufacturing and technology will give us both lower cost and greater control of our supply chain. It is with this confidence, we look forward to sharing with you more details of our plans in our capital management call next week. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Pitzer : Yeah, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on solid results. Dave and Rafael, last quarter was the first quarter you talked about customers being a little bit more selective about their ordering patterns. And that was somewhat reflected in upside in September, which was a little bit muted. You characterized Q4 as being the same, but the upside was a little bit stronger. I'm wondering if you could help me just square that circle as to what drove the magnitude of upside in the December quarter above that of September. Dave Pahl : Yeah, John, I'll take that. Yeah, the upside that we saw in the fourth quarter was very, very broad-based. So as we described it, it was acrossed our product families, acrossed our end markets and geography. So it really wasn't one thing that was driving it and was very broad-based. So that was the difference that we saw between last quarter and this quarter. Do you have a follow-up? John Pitzer : Yeah. Just as a follow-up, notwithstanding, the impressive growth you put up in your Analog business in calendar year 2021, if I comp that against the SIA, it's going to end up having been an unusual year for you guys, because you would have undergrown the industry by a fairly wide margin, at least versus history. And I'm wondering if you can help me understand, is that a function of peers being a bit more aggressive on pricing menu? Is it something that we shouldn't take to the trend, or how do you explain the difference there? Dave Pahl : Yeah. I think whenever we look at the SIA data, regardless of which direction that is trending, and you'll know that I'll always be consistent that I say never look at one quarter, sometimes even one year on specifics. That really needs to be something that is looked at over time, especially we go through a period the last four, six quarters through COVID and the choppiness that's been going on, I'd just be real careful to get too precise on measuring things in this type of time period. So I think with our competitive advantages, with the investments that we're making, we're very confident that we're making progress in the markets that we're making those investments. And we really believe that we've made progress over this time period. Thank you, John. And we\u2019ll go to next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll hear next from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious, how would you characterize the demand environment? Would you call it early, mid or late cycle, or if I ask the question differently, do you think any of your end market is overheated right now in any way? Dave Pahl : Yeah. Vivek, I would say that the demand environment is similar to what we saw 90 days ago. So we had seen strength in orders, and our backlog continue to be strong, those types of things. The upside that we saw, of course, this quarter was very broad-based. And so that was difference here in the fourth quarter. I'd say that we did see the match-set behavior last quarter. And again, we did see it again this quarter. And that's where customers are really looking to complete that instead of expediting across the board. And you could describe that behavior as being symptomatic of growing customer inventory that's out of mix. But as we've talked about previously, we don't have direct visibility into customer inventory. So that's not something that we could measure over time. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek? Vivek Arya : Yes. Thank you, Dave. So the other question is now on the supply side. There is an investor concern that the semiconductor industry is over investing at a time when demand might be peaking. And I know you guys have made it clear that you invest for the longer-term. But how are you thinking about your current acceleration on the investment side? When does that translate into actual useful capacity? And what are you doing to make sure that you don't over invest, right, at least in the next couple of quarters? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Vivek, I'll go ahead and take that. As you alluded to at the beginning of the question, we think of the long-term when we make this decision. So this is not about 2021, 2022 or even 2023. This is over the long-term. And the secular trends in our industry, we're confident of where those are pointing and specifically, in our products, analog and embedded, and the end markets that -- where we put a strategic priority industrial automotive. So on the manufacturing investments that you alluded to, we're very excited about those. As I mentioned during the prepared remarks, they're going to strengthen our competitive advantage on manufacturing and technology. First, we're going to have significant 300-millimeter capacity coming online with RFAB2 and Lehi. That's going to happen actually this year and then going to next year with Lehi. Second, with the announcement of the Sherman Complex, we're going to have a road map that's going to support us out to 2035. And then finally, customers are very excited about our investments specifically in 45- to 130-nanometer process technologies that are optimized for Analog and Embedded and will support the customers' growth for decades ahead. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Vivek. And we\u2019ll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear next from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Your days of inventory came in at 116. And as you pointed out, you're still below where you'd like to be. But to the extent you have visibility into customer inventory, how would you characterize where they are today? And where do you see them going, going forward? Rafael Lizardi : Well, so I'll start, and I'll comment on our own inventories. And Dave, if you want to add to that. But yes, you pointed out is our inventory days are 116. That is higher by about four days from last quarter, but still well below where we want to be. And our goal is to be significantly higher than that. Our guidance on that is 130 to 190 days. Just know that that's a very tactical metric, because it's just based on one quarter. The bottom line is that we want to have more inventory. And in that measure, I would not be uncomfortable at the very high end or even above the high end of that measure at some point, 190 days of inventory. Dave Pahl : Yes. And I think just I'll follow up with -- as I commented before, we just don't have direct visibility into customer inventory. So it's not something that we can measure directly. Yes, go on Toshiya Toshiya Hari : Yes, I do. Thank you. I wanted to ask about OpEx, a fairly mundane item, but you've done an incredible job in leveraging OpEx over the past couple of years, during which revenue has gone up significantly, particularly considering kind of the inflationary environment and the competition for talent. What's driving the flattish OpEx? And how should we think about potential upside to OpEx going forward, given the current backdrop? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So I'll take that. First, yes, we've been running OpEx at about $3.2 billion per year, a little lower, a little higher than that. But for the last five years, eventually, they've rounded. That number has rounded to that. OpEx, most of OpEx is an investment. That's how we think about it. Obviously, R&D continues to strengthen our -- the broadest portfolio in the industry that we have, both analog and embedded. But even inside of SG&A, there are several key pieces there that are key investments. Ti.com is one that comes to mind, and we'll talk more about Ti.com specifically at the capital management call next week. So OpEx fuels our future growth. We don't really think about it from a percent of revenue standpoint. But to help you with that, we have guided that over the long term should trend between 20% and 25%. Of course, we're -- right now, we're at about 18% or so. So that 3.2, I wouldn't expect it to change significantly in the short term. But over time, over many years, it should -- 20% to 25% is probably the right way to look at it. Dave Pahl : Okay. Great. Thank you, Toshiya. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Dave Pahl : We\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear next from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Congrats on the strong result and guide. I wanted to ask about the gross margin side of things. I know one quarter doesn't make a trend, but the incremental gross margin was way bigger in the fourth quarter than expected. And it seems like the first quarter has also guided for the gross margin to perhaps rise again sequentially. So whether it's a short term or kind of a longer-term description or answer, what are the big drivers of the upside that you're seeing in the near term? And how much of that do we expect to continue going into 2022 and beyond? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So a couple of angles on that question on gross margin. First, as you know, you follow us for a long time, we do not manage to gross margin. We manage to the growth of free cash flow per share. We think that's the key driver of value for the long-term owners of the company. And you can do that with higher gross margins. You can do that with lower gross margins. So that's our focus. But specifically on gross margins, our guidance has been and continues to be, think about it on a fall-through basis, over the long term, 70%, 75%. We have been doing pretty well on that front. The key driver, of course, is revenue growth. But then beyond that 300-millimeter capacity, that continues to be a great tailwind as we have more and more of our capacity on 300-millimeter, we had -- has a structural cost advantage and we'll be continuing to add to that with our RFAB2, Lehi and the Sherman Complex. The last comment I'll make is -- and we'll give you more details on that next week on capital management, but CapEx has been going up and will continue to go up over a number of years with those investments that I mentioned. Those are long-term investments. Those are going to set us up great for the next 15-plus years. So I'm very happy about this. I'm pleased with that. We're confident about those. But that does flow through the P&L as higher depreciation. So I expect CapEx to go up, and depreciation will follow. And that will have an impact on gross margins. But frankly, at the end of the day, that's accounting. The investment is happening now. It will happen over the next few years with that additional CapEx, and that will just put us in a great position to grow the top line and have really great fall-throughs over a long tome to come. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Ross? Ross Seymore : Yeah. I just wanted to pivot back to the revenue side. And whether it's industrial or automotive, your two focused markets, they look like they both grew kind of 30%, 35% year-over-year in 2021 as a whole. That's significantly faster than the secular growth rate that you guys have delivered, but not terribly different than the peer group for the year. So I just wondered how do you guys explain that level of growth. You don't seem to see any inventory anywhere. The end markets don't seem to be growing that fast. But whether it's for TI specific or the group as a whole, I wonder -- the sector as a whole, I wonder how you would explain that growth and the sustainability of it? Dave Pahl : Yeah. So I think that it's clear, as we look at those markets over time, we believe that there's going to be content growth. So let me just talk about the long-term prospects of both of those markets. So it's very easily seen in the automotive market that there's content growth. We can see the cars today just have more semi content in them per vehicle than what we drove five years ago and 10 years ago. And it's very clear that, that's going to continue. That same phenomenon, it's just a lot harder to see, is going on in the industrial market, and that's what we love about it. It's not one thing we've got 13 sectors that make up that market. We have hundreds of end equipments that we're working on and tens of thousands of customers that we're working for. And our product portfolio is just positioned perfectly for that. So it's really a strategic focus that's on it. Now is there going to be noise around growth rates in any one given year? And John pointed out with SIA data, the stuff bouncing around, that's going to happen, but we're going to put in place growth and capacity to support that growth for the long-term. And it's because we've got the confidence that those markets are going to grow and those secular trends are going to continue. So thank you, Ross. And we\u2019ll go to next caller please. Operator : Thank you. And now we'll move on to our next question from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you and congratulations on the solid execution here. First question is on customer behavior, perhaps on the ordering front. So I think there's a lot of investors that are worried that inflation is kind of stalling the economies globally. Are you not seeing any change at all in your customer\u2019s behavior from higher prices, because obviously, there is inflation in the semi-con industry, too. So have you not seen any change in order behavior at all sequentially? Dave Pahl : Well, yeah, Tore, I'll start, and Rafael, if you want to add anything. I'd say that the environment that, as we mentioned before, is very similar to 90 days ago. The customer behavior that we talked about with the match set continued. So really not -- in a 90-day period, has there been a change nothing that we could measure on that front. So Rafael, anything to add? Rafael Lizardi : No. Dave Pahl : No. Yes. So you have a follow-on? Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you for that. When we think about your capacity expansion, you talked a lot about the front end. But Rafael, you mentioned you're also doing some assembly and test expansions. Could you elaborate a little bit on that, especially how it would impact the CapEx numbers going forward? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. No, thanks for that question. We -- as you alluded to, a lot of the conversations on CapEx, they tend to be on the fab side. That's because that's where a disproportionate amount of the money goes to, which is very capital intensive. And it's also because the lead times to build those are much longer, the type of structure that you have to build, et cetera. But we're also spending a lot of time internally on the back-end and what we need to do on that front. We're going to give you more details on that next week. But essentially, we do have plans going on at various countries where we already have operations to continue to expand capacity to match that front-end capacity and always be ahead of demand. Dave Pahl : Great. We\u2019ll go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the solid results and execution. As you guys mentioned, relative to your view 90 days ago, it looks like things didn't change all that much from a fundamental perspective, right, selective hotspots, lead time stable, broad-based demand. So how much of the upside was actually driven by an increase in supply availability, both from your internal manufacturing and outsource partners? Because it looks like you guys were capacity constrained starting from about the middle of last year. So just wondering if you're able to bring on some additional supply in Q4, which drove some of the upside? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So I'll start, and Dave, if you want to chime in. But I would tell you, first, as Dave mentioned during the call, prepared remarks and during a couple of questions, the strength was broad-based across geographies and end markets, et cetera. On your specific comment on capacity. As we have said probably for the last four quarters or so any longer, we have been and will continue to bring capacity incrementally. Incrementally, meaning relatively small steps. But nevertheless, those make a difference, especially on a cumulative basis, right? So we have been doing that for some time, and that's obviously helping. I mean you could see not only our revenue has improved during this cycle, but we went from draining inventory to now, the last two quarters, we've actually increased inventory, albeit at a relatively low level, but still much better than draining in inventory. So that gives you an appreciation for what that incremental relations to capacity have done. We expect to continue to increase incrementally, again, relatively small steps for another two quarters, and then RFAB2 comes online sometime in the third quarter of this year of 2022, and that will give us more legroom on those tailwinds. And then about six months later, first Q 2023, we'll have Lehi, LFAB come online once it's qualified, and that will give us also more legroom on that front. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Harlan? Harlan Sur : Yes. Thanks. Thanks for letting me ask the follow-up. So when the team announced the purchase of the Lehi 300-millimeter fab, you noted that Lehi would start off with 65- and 45-nanometer analog and embedded processing products, which is somewhat of a strategic change, right, because you guys have always been focused on 300-millimeter analog product. So is TI bringing embedded in-house because you have some sort of competitive differentiators on the manufacturing side for your next-generation embedded portfolio, or is it just a focus on lower cost versus outsourcing and moving the manufacturing mix towards more in-sourced over time? Dave Pahl : Yes, I'll start, and Rafael, if you want to add, please do. If you look, we do manufacture embedded today and DMOS6. So part of our manufacturing footprint today includes embedded. And so with the Lehi factory, we will be able to build additional products there. And I would say, over time, foundry will continue to be a portion of our footprint. But as our revenue grows as a percentage of revenue, could that move some, but it could. But we will continue to build products, both internally and externally. And I'll just say that, as we invest in 300-millimeter, both for analog and embedded, that brings the same cost advantages to us. It allows better control of our supply chain. And certainly, in periods like this, it shows why that's an important advantage for us. So, okay. Thank you, Harlan. And I think we've got time for one more caller. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in, Dave and Rafael. I had a question on end markets. And specifically in auto, there is a lot of concern. It has been for more than a couple of quarters about semi components going into the industry and the auto units, the big gap. And if I look at your automotive, the year-over-year change, at least a rapid -- I think it was up 2x a couple of quarters ago. That seems to be decelerating. So can you just help us kind of understand -- it seems to be some parts like for the -- the concern is that the supply chain collectively is holding up on a lot of inventory. So just with -- I'd love to get your perspective. And Dave, I think last quarter, you had given us a pre-pandemic level, and you had kind of contrasted what you shipped last quarter versus that number? Dave Pahl : Yes. So, Ambrish, maybe I'll start, and Rafael, if you want to want to add to it. And first, I'll just make a comment that, our team has done a good job supporting customers really across all of our end markets. When we look at that pre-pandemic level of fourth quarter of 2019 and just picking that to fourth quarter 2021, revenue overall is up 40%. And we grew shipments in all of our end markets. So I think that that's important to point out. So we believe inside of that, we've made strategic progress in industrial and automotive that will pay dividends for us for years ahead. But our teams really have done a great job supporting customers across that board. And some of those year-on-year transitions, Ambrish, as you know, some of those really big numbers. I think one quarter, we had close to 100%, maybe even above that. That was more of a function of how low shipments have gotten the quarter before. So that's where I talk about when things get really noisy, you really have to begin to look at it over these longer periods of time. But I think that that's a really good number to look at for our overall shipments. So do you have a follow-up to that, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : I had a separate follow-up, Dave. I've never seen a -- such a broad mention of a TI chip in short as PMIC. And it started with PC. Now we hear from pretty much every end market. Everybody is pointing the TI. The question I get from investors, and I have it myself as well, so I don't want to just say from investors, just how did TI -- you guys are -- at least I hold you at the pedestal in terms of ops, planning, supply chain management. How did you guys get through that point where one part -- and I know it's a small piece of your overall business. But more importantly, how do you convince us that this does not translate into potential share losses when people start to design you out potentially because this time, several quarters, you couldn't supply the part? Dave Pahl : Yeah. Fair question, Ambrish. And I'd point to maybe a couple of things. First, I'd point that we've got the broadest portfolio in the industry. When we engage with customers, it's not unusual for us to have a dozen, two dozen, sometimes three, four dozen different components shipped or on any particular design in any particular system. So it only takes one of those products to -- for our teams to have to work closely with that customer on. And as I talked about before, our teams have really done a great job supporting customers across the board, across those products. And that's what we'll continue to focus on. I think as we look to this year, we've got capacity coming online later this year with RFAB2 and those investments. Rafael talked about, we're putting in capacity. Every quarter this year, we've put in capacity, every quarter last year incrementally. So you see that showing up in our results. And then we've got -- followed that up with the Lehi fab in early 2023. So I think we're in a really good position to continue to support our customers overall. So we'll continue to work really hard at that and deliver the results that follow with that. Dave Pahl : So with that, I'd like to remind everyone of our upcoming capital management call. And it is on February 3rd at 10 AM Central Time and a replay of this call will be available shortly on our website. Good evening. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you all for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please, go ahead, sir. Dave Pahl : Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into first quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our customers and markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for second quarter, including the impact from COVID-19 restrictions in China. Starting with a quick overview of first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $4.9 billion, an increase of 2% sequentially and 14% year-over-year, driven by growth in industrial and automotive, as well as enterprise systems. Analog revenue grew 16%, Embedded Processing grew 2%, and our Other segment grew 27% from the year ago quarter. Now, let me comment on the environment in the first quarter to provide some context on what we saw with our customers and markets. Overall, the quarter came in about as we expected across product segments, end markets and geographies. The market environment in the first quarter was similar to what we've observed for the last several quarters. Customers continued to be selective in their expedite requests, focusing on products that completed a matched set, rather than expediting products across the board. This behavior was not specific to any product family, end market or geography. Moving on, I'll provide some insight into our first quarter revenue by end market from the year ago quarter. First, the industrial and automotive markets were each up about 20% and both were driven by broad-based growth across sectors. Personal electronics was down mid-single digits off a strong compare. And next, communications equipment was up about 10%. And finally, Enterprise Systems was up about 35% off of a weak compare, and the growth was primarily from data centers and enterprise computing. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, first quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.4 billion or 70% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 500 basis points. As a reminder, we had about $50 million of additional utility expenses in cost of revenue related to the winter storm in the year ago quarter. Operating expenses in the quarter were $830 million, about flat from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.2 billion or 17% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $66 million in the first quarter and are associated with the LFAB purchase we closed in October of last year. Operating profit was $2.6 billion in the quarter or 52% of revenue. Operating profit was up 32% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $2.2 billion or $2.35 per share, which included a $0.02 benefit that was not in our prior outlook. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations were $2.1 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $443 million in the quarter and $2.6 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.5 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $589 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $5 billion in the past 12 months. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.8 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt outstanding was $7.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.6%. Inventory dollars were up $150 million from the prior quarter to $2.1 billion and days were 127, up 11 days sequentially but still below the higher levels. For the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.84 to $2.26. This outlook comprehends an impact due to reduced demand from COVID-19 restrictions in China, which are affecting our customers' manufacturing operations. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate for 2022 to be about 14% and our effective tax rate to be about a point lower. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We're going to take our first question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. First of all, I was wondering if you had any feeling for the size of the gap in revenue that's getting impacted by the COVID issues in China. Do you have any view for like what demand would be if you could ship? And like are the customers like getting out of line at all? Is the overall demand and order environment like kind of where it was, you just can't ship. But any color you can give on the size of that gap would be helpful. . Dave Pahl : Yes, Stacy, I'll comment on that. Our assessment in early April indicated that revenue would continue to incrementally grow again in the second quarter. However, it just became clear that we were experiencing lower demand, particularly due to COVID-19 restrictions in China. And just to be clear, customers' behavior wasn't changing as it related to backlog or cancellations. In fact, we continue to see expedites for deliveries. However, we did see that our customers' manufacturing operations were being impacted. So as a result, the approach that we took, we just took a tops-down assessment and just reduced the midpoint of second quarter by 10%, and so from roughly $5 billion at the midpoint to the $4.5 billion that you see. And the second thing we did was we slightly widened the range just to comprehend the higher uncertainty that we're seeing overall. Do you have a follow-up, Stacy? Stacy Rasgon : I do. Thank you. And that's helpful. Just wondering if the fact that you guys have most internal manufacturing and you're trying to go most direct. Does that imply that I mean you have to ship more direct to your customers in China? Do you think that these kinds of issues would impact you more than the broader industry, or do you think this is something that everybody is going to have to be dealing with to the same degree? Rafael Lizardi : Stacy, our sense this is primarily due to issues with our operations that our customers factories. And it is not related to shipping direct or to distribution or anything of that sort. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Stacy. And we\u2019ll go to next caller please. Operator : Absolutely. We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thank you for taking my question. The first one also related to China. Do you think this is something you can recover? Is this demand destruction or is this something you can recover? And then along those lines, how would you characterize demand excluding your China customers where there were no other of these kind of restrictions in place? Dave Pahl : Yeah. Vivek, again, the approach that we took was really just a top down 10% assessment of what the impact would be. So I wouldn't look at that as any precision in choosing that number. Part of the reason why we widened the guidance, I think trying to get into predictions of what could happen as the quarter unfolds. I think time will tell, and we'll see how that unfolds, and we'll report that when the quarter is over. So that's really the approach that we took at trying to assess what was going on. Do you have a follow-on? Vivek Arya : Yes. Thanks Dave. So how are you managing your fab utilization and your inventory? It seems like you're implying gross margins down a few hundred basis points sequentially. So just curious how you're managing fab utilization? Because I thought I heard Rafael say that you are still below your target inventory level. So do you continue to plan and build more inventory during the quarter? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. So a couple of things in that question. Let me try to address most of them. We, our factories are running at high levels of utilization as they have been over the last couple of years really. We've continue -- in fact, we continue adding incremental capacity, as we have said we would. And the next step beyond incremental will be one RFAB2 starts production in the second half of the year and then LFAB in the first quarter of next year of 2023, well, the thing that we're breaking ground later this year for the Sherman factory.  So, we're going to continue running our production high. We are going to build inventory, inventory did build about $150 million in this last quarter we just reported, but we're still below desired level. So, our intent is to continue building that inventory that is -- our objective inventory, as you know, is to maintain high levels of customer service and roughly our target is 130 to 190 days, but we want to be at the high end of that, and we would not be uncomfortable even above the high end of that range. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Vivek, and we'll go to the next call. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll hear next from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore : Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess the China side is weak and I guess 10% is as good a number as anyone could come up with. But to the extent there are shortages across the industry and demand elsewhere, it doesn't sound like it's changed from part of your preamble, Dave. Why wouldn't this allow a little bit of the fungibility of your standard product shipments to just increase to those customers and shortages to make up for the shortfall that you're otherwise going to see in China? Rafael Lizardi : So yes, no, that's a fair question, and that's already embedded in our process to the extent that, that is doable. We are \u2013 our process allow for that redirecting of inventory. But keep in mind, we're talking about 100,000 different parts -- 100,000 different customers, 80,000 different parts, so it never quite fits in a perfect situation where the access in one place can go to the other players in Italy, right? And then the other thing I would tell you, just like Dave stressed a couple of times, this is a tub-down estimate assessment on that adjustment, it\u2019s not meant to imply precision. Dave Pahl : And maybe I will just add to that too, Ross. The behavior that we've talked about now for a couple of quarters that we've been seeing as customers being more focused on match sets and that can be symptomatic of growing customer inventory that's out of mix. So even though, we might have some parts that are available in one region, customers may not need them in the other. So, you've got multiple dynamics at work there. Do you have a follow-on? Ross Seymore : I do. Since kind of we collectively have given you guys some grief over the last couple of years for not really buying back any stock, despite your 100% cash return goals. This quarter, you did, and it seems like you got pretty darn close back to that 100% return. What changed? Rafael Lizardi : So Ross, you've known us for a long time and you know how we think about cash return, but just for everybody else, we talked about this in capital management every quarter, our objective when it comes to cash returns to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. We do that through dividends and repurchases. And we've been really consistent in how we do that and we have a really good track record. So we have done that and are committed to continuing to do that. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Ross. We\u2019ll go to the next caller, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll hear next from Chris Danley with Citi. Chris Danley : Hey, thanks guys. So given all these COVID issues in China and shutdowns, but then no change in the rest of the world. Do you expect the shortage situation at TI and in Semi\u2019s to get better or worse from this, or do you think it will be no change. Dave Pahl : Yes. I'll take a first shot, and Rafael, if you want to add in. I -- we're not trying to predict the cycle or call even the out quarters of what's going on. I think, what we'll continue to do and how -- just how we approach things independent of cycles is just staying focused on building the company stronger for the long term. And that includes things like adding in the new manufacturing capacity that we have, investing in R&D, investing in new capabilities. So those are the things that we can control -- and that's what we'll stay focused on. Do you have a follow-on, Chris? Chris Danley : Yes. So if we take the COVID issues in China outside, how would -- any sort of end market commentary you would make, anything a little better or worse than your expectations, either during the quarter or going forward? Dave Pahl : Yes. The quarter came in, I'd say about what we expected. We were just slightly above the top end of our range overall. The quarter was driven by the industrial and automotive markets. We did see a strong growth in enterprise systems, as we had talked about. That was primarily from data center and enterprise computing. Now, that's a small part of our revenue, but you saw it grow strongly last quarter. And as you look over the coming years, that probably will continue to be a strong grower, but it's just not a very large portion of our revenue. So we continue to be pleased with the growth that we're seeing in industrial and automotive. That -- when you zoom out for a second, that is where the strategic focus has been for the company. And so, we're pleased to see that turn in to grow longer term. So, thank you, Chris, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear next from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could address first in terms of -- you said you're still seeing strong expedite activity. Are the constraints that you guys are still seeing coming from your internal fab capacity from foundry back end? Can you just kind of give us an idea where the bottlenecks are? Rafael Lizardi : So I'll start. First, I want to maybe adjust what your premise a little bit. We are still seeing some experts. But as Dave mentioned a couple of times, customers continue to be selective in how they're expedited. So they're continuing to focus on the match set, okay? So it's not just expedite across the board. Second, specifically on what you said on the second part of your question, what we're seeing is primarily based on the how our customers' manufacturing and operation is -- are being affected in China. Dave Pahl : And we're able to meet many of those expedite requests as well. So I think your question more, Joe, is where we do have constraints, what\u2019s driving those. And that's not specific to any product or any particular area. It can move from one quarter to the other. It may be a process technology. It could be a packaging technology, other things that may drive it, that our teams work with customers on to meet those needs. Do you have a follow-on? Joe Moore : Yes. I also was curious about pricing to the extent that your competition has kind of passed along foundry price increases and has raised prices. How have you guys reacted to that? And do you have -- can you give us any sense for what your pricing has done on a like-for-like basis? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So, a couple of things. First, on the input cost side of veins, part of our -- one of our competitive advantages is manufacturing and technology, we own the vast majority of our manufacturing. In fact, on the front end, over 80%, and our goal is to grow that to 90% over the coming years. So, that puts us in a really good situation to not be beholden to the mercy of what those foundries or subcons do in terms of pricing, right? So, we have a much better way to handle those input costs. So, that's on the input cost side of things. On the pricing in general, we are pricing with our customers. Our process on that has not changed. Our process is to price to market. And as prices have moved up over the last two or three quarters, and that certainly did happen in first quarter, we have moved our prices as well, and growth in first quarter did benefit from the pricing tailwind. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Joe. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : I just wanted to push on this 10% that you talked about the haircut for June. If the lockdown seem like they're already getting a little bit better, they're seeming to kind of loosen up a little bit. So I guess the question is, does the 10% assume that the situation persists through the month of June -- or if it gets better between now and June, will that 10% prove to be conservative? And then I had a follow-up as well. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. And I know maybe it's on site is fine, but I'll just repeat what we said before. This is a top-level assessment. That doesn\u2019t meant to imply precision -- in fact, just like as we said earlier, we even widened the range to reflect that higher uncertainty. So, time will tell. And when we report 90 days from now, we'll see what things land. Timothy Arcuri : Got it. Maybe it's my -- yes, thanks Dave. So, I guess my second question is, this is a question that Ross asked before. But if customers are so tight and if the lockdowns are certainly going to be transitory, I would think it seems like customers would just take the product and they would put it into inventory. So, obviously, during the past three weeks, you opted to take this big cut to guidance. But is that because they're pushing out shipments -- or is it because they just can't accept shipment of your product? I mean it seems like it has to be the latter versus them pushing out shipments or not pulling from consignment because everything is tight and the whole chain is trying to build inventory. Thanks. Dave Pahl : Sure. Yes. And Tim, I think we've talked about now for a couple of quarters that we've observed behavior where customers' behavior really shifted to focusing on those match sets. And as we've talked about, that can be symptomatic of growing customer inventory that's just not a mix, right? So -- and with that, we've got tens of thousands of products that are immediately available on ti.com. So, they can get more product if they wanted and if they're indiscriminate of the types of products that they need. But increasingly, they're trying to find those match sets to complete those bills. Whether that's our product. In some cases, a lot of times, it's our peers products in the industry, and sometimes it's maybe not even a semiconductor product that that they need to complete their system to get it out the door. So yeah, so just to say just because you have a product sitting there, customers just indiscriminately aren't taking product overall. Rafael Lizardi : Let me just add to that. And Tim, if I understood your question correctly, if you're asking tactically of whether the customers -- where is the bottleneck for the customers in China not being able to run their operations. We're seeing cases where factories are shutdown, and they just will not accept -- they cannot accept deliveries. In other cases, the freight forwarders will not take our parts from our distribution centers to ship them to the factories in China, particular in the Shanghai area because those are shutdown. So tactically, that is what's keeping the primary reason but we took this adjustment because that's keeping our parts from being delivered to\u2026 Dave Pahl : Or you run staff or other reasons are going on that's reducing that demand. Okay. Thank you, Tim. We\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : And so we'll take our next question from William Stein with Truist Securities. William Stein : Great. Thanks. The last question is very similar to mine. And I just want to ask it maybe a little bit more of a detailed fashion. When we talk about the disruptions in China, are you -- maybe you can just provide a bit more detail. Are you not shipping to the region as a whole, or are you taking this on a customer-by-customer basis in terms of what you're choosing to -- in terms of what you're able to ship? And then the follow-up is related to that, we've heard at least one large automotive OEM talk about having opened up their facility recently and ramping with a vengeance. And I wonder if you see this among customers more broadly, or is that an exception? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. So I'll give you my take. It is case by case. There's at least just a report, dozens if not hundreds of factories that are shutdown, but there are other hundreds that are operating at different levels, right -- some -- and some cities are affected more than others. Obviously, Shanghai, we've all read in the news what's going on there and factories in that area affected more. But there are restrictions beyond Shanghai. But it's case by case. Their factor is operating at zero, like complete shutdown, there are others operate at 20%, 50% and so forth. Do you have a follow-on? William Stein : Perhaps you can talk about changes in delivery patterns by channel; in particular, I'd be curious if you saw any slowdown in orders at ti.com, which I think is somewhat of a different channel from your typical direct business? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yeah. I would say that in the quarter, as we described the environment in first quarter, we would describe it as similar to what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And just order rates and cancellation -- order rates remain strong, cancellations, reschedules and those things that customer behavior is consistent. Those things are low and consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of quarters, and that's across those different channels and inputs. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. The other thing I would add is, as we have seen in other cases during the entire pandemic, but being able to ship direct and have the direct relationship with customers, it's just a huge advantage, especially when you face these type of challenges just not having an intermediary that, kind of, frankly, most of the time gets in the way, and it's not optimal for your relationship with the customer, but also there's the tactical operational delivery of products. So whether it's ti.com or non-ti.com legacy shipments are going direct, it's a huge benefit, being able to do that, now close to 70% of our revenues directly. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Will. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : Hey. Thanks for filling me in. I want to ask you on the CapEx plans, you're pretty clear about your plans of the capital allocation today. I guess, the spend in March is a little bit kind of flat at that kind of base level, you are fairly high. I guess, you were talking about adding capacity in the second half. So maybe refresh us if you're still going to spend kind of $3.5 billion and if the capacity is still coming in line in the second half? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So a couple of angles on your question. First, no changes to our plans. These are long-term plans. So our -- in terms of CapEx. So our $2.5 billion per year for the next four years that is intact. We're very excited about those. I'm very excited about those. We are -- RFAB2 will ramp production in the second half of this year. Lehi will qualify and ramp production in the first quarter of next year. In just a matter of weeks or a month or so, we're going to break ground in Sherman. So that's all very exciting and that is not changing. Maybe the first part of your question, on the CapEx, short term, just keep in mind that the fourth quarter CapEx had the Lehi numbers there. So that's why that number was higher and now you're seeing that number come down in first quarter. That's just, you had about $800 million -- close to $900 million worth of CapEx. But our plans, the $2.5 billion run rate per year for 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, of course, that's just an average. But that is still -- that is in place, and we're very excited about that. Dave Pahl : Yes. That's just math. Blayne, do you have a follow-up? Blayne Curtis : Yes. Well, I guess, 400 times 4 is not 3.5%. That was, I guess, the question, but I guess you're still sticking to that forecast and as you go up. Rafael Lizardi : Well, just remember, just an average, the $3.5 billion is an average. So it's not going to be every year, $2.5 billion. We'll likely run below -- very likely run below 2.5 in 2022, which, of course, means we'll run higher in the next three years. That's just the math on that, right? Blayne Curtis : Right. And then, I guess, just for the guide, I want to make sure I understand the mechanics. It sounds like utilization stays high. The mix has been kind of industrial and auto, that all favorable on gross margin, you did hit 70%. I think, a lot of companies have signaled that maybe gross margins would tail off through the rest of the year as kind of pricing comes down. I\u2019m kind of curious of your perspective on, kind of, gross margins at this level being sustainable for the rest of the year. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Our focus is not on managing gross margins. Our focus has been and will continue to be on growing free cash flow per share for the long term. So gross margin will be what it will be, but we'll continue to make our investments on CapEx to support our revenue plans and generate long-term growth of free cash flow. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Blayne. And we've got time for one more caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you, Rafael, Dave. I had a question on -- I just wanted to make sure I understood this. From a top down, I got that perspective. But -- then Dave, I thought, I heard you mention that cancellations have not changed. Why shouldn't cancellation change if you're taking your numbers down by 10%, should that lead to cancellations changing versus what they have been in the last couple of quarters? Dave Pahl : Yes. So just to explain that. Customers that where their operations are being impacted, they would still like that product. And so they are not canceling those orders, they'd still like to be in line and get that product as soon as they can take it. So that's what they're communicating to us from that. So that's why we're not -- that's not showing up as a cancellation though we are seeing the demand being impacted at this point. Ambrish Srivastava : Got it. But that metric is usually for that one quarter or -- and I should know this answer, but I don't that metric is usually for the quarter that you provide us or is for more than -- is it for longer than a quarter? Dave Pahl : Well, yeah, the cancellations, as we look at them, are the cancellations that we would receive in a quarter it could, of course, be for demand that might be outside of either in the current quarter or even a longer period of time, if a cancellation comes in, right? A customer could say they want to cancel an order for next week and also for six months out as well. So -- but if they canceled it, we record it as a cancellation in the quarter that we received the cancellation, so. Ambrish Srivastava : Got it. Dave Pahl : Well, with that, we'll go ahead and wrap up, Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Okay. So let me wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously at our core, we're engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we'll continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we're personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When we're successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you all for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Dave Pahl : Welcome to Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. I\u2019m Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. Today, we\u2019ll provide the following updates. First, I\u2019ll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I\u2019ll provide insight into second quarter revenue results, with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our customers and markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for third quarter 2022. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $5.2 billion, an increase of 6% sequentially and 14% year-over-year, driven by growth across markets. Analog revenue grew 15%, Embedded Processing grew 5%, and our Other segment grew 19% from the year-ago quarter. Now let me comment on the environment in second quarter to provide some context of what we saw with our customers and markets. As we spoke about in our last earnings call, April started out weak from COVID-19 restrictions in China. As those restrictions began to ease towards the latter part of May and into June, customers began to pull product generally consistent with their prior demand forecasts at the start of the quarter. Moving on, I\u2019ll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by market from the year-ago quarter. First, the industrial market was up high-single digits and the automotive market was up more than 20%. We saw weakness throughout the quarter in personal electronics, which grew low-single digits. Next, communications equipment was up about 25%. Finally, enterprise systems was up mid-teens. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, second quarter revenue was $5.2 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.6 billion or 70% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 240 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $836 million, up 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.2 billion or 17% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $66 million in the second quarter and are associated with the LFAB factory that we purchased in October of last year. Operating profit was $2.7 billion in the quarter or 52% of revenue. Operating profit was up 23% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $2.3 billion or $2.45 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $597 million in the quarter and $2.8 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $1.2 billion of our stock. In total, we have returned $6.2 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. We retired $0.5 billion of debt in the quarter. Total debt outstanding was $7.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.7%. Inventory dollars were up $139 million from the prior quarter to $2.2 billion and days were 125, down two days sequentially and below desired levels. Accounts receivable for this quarter ended at $2.2 billion, up from $1.6 billion a year ago. This increase primarily reflects the higher proportion of shipments made near the end of the quarter, as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted in China and customers began pulling product. For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.90 billion to $5.30 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $2.23 to $2.51. This outlook comprehends the weaker demand we see, particularly from customers in the personal electronics market. We expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be about 14%. Lastly, we and our customers remain pleased with the progress of our expansion of manufacturing capacity, which was outlined in our February Capital Management Call and will support the long-term secular trend of increased semiconductor content per system. We broke ground on the Sherman manufacturing complex in May and work continues at RFAB2 and LFAB to prepare for production output. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we\u2019ll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I guess, I wanted to ask about gross margins. So, they declined -- they were very strong objectively, but they declined sequentially from Q1 to Q2 even as revenue grow and then I know you don\u2019t guide gross margins for next quarter, but if I sort of like squint at the math, they seem to be being guided down probably a little more than revenues. I\u2019m just wondering if something is going on, whether on the cost line or on the pricing line in this environment that may be influencing gross margins at all? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. Stacy, I\u2019m happy to address that. So first, as you pointed out, our gross margin in second quarter was about 70%. We are pleased with that performance. The fall through on a year-on-year basis was almost 90%. I would also point out that you can see this on our cash flow statement, depreciation increase sequentially by about $30 million and that\u2019s a direct result of the investments in manufacturing capacity. On your second part of your question on a go-forward basis, as expected, depreciation is going to increase. We\u2019ve talked about that in the February call. To help you, I\u2019ll tell you that for 2022 expect depreciation to be about $1 billion for the full year. Do you have a follow up? Stacy Rasgon : I do. Thank you. It sounds like you had a surge in demand at the end of Q2, as everything opened up. So I guess that\u2019s leading into Q3. I\u2019m just wondering if the shape of the revenue the linearity through Q3 kind of looks the reverse of what we saw in Q2, we had a weak start and a strong finish in Q2, do you think we have like a strong start and then maybe a weaker finish into Q3, just given that, I guess, the demand surge that we\u2019ve got going into it? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. Stacy, this last quarter, obviously, was unusual in it because of the COVID restrictions that we had talked about, right? So those shipments were scheduled earlier in the quarter. So really were reflective of the restrictions lifting and our ability to and customer\u2019s ability to be able to receive that product. So you have that noise going into it. But as we said, in the prepared remarks that we did see weakness in the personal electronics market and that weakness is comprehended in the guidance in third quarter. So, thank you, Stacy. We\u2019ll go to the next caller, please. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. First one, I think, you mentioned, Q3 is below seasonal, because of pressure on the consumer. I\u2019m curious, what about the other segments, automotive, industrial, comm. equipment, enterprise and so forth? Do you see their demand is seasonal or different than that? Dave Pahl : Yeah. Vivek, I would say that as you know, we don\u2019t forecast the out quarter by market, with the exception when there\u2019s something significant that\u2019s an outlier and hence that\u2019s why we\u2019re highlighting personal electronics. So I would just leave it at that. That\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing really most of the weakness. Do you have follow-on? Vivek Arya : And my fellow -- yes. Thank you, Dave. So my follow-up is actually on free cash flow. If I go back to calendar 2020, TI\u2019s free cash flow was 38% of sales, last year it was 34%. Now on a trailing 12-month basis, it\u2019s just 30%. And then you\u2019re guiding down Q2 through below seasonal and Q4 and Q1 are tend to be below that also and then you mentioned that you\u2019re committed to your CapEx plans. So is this a fair representation of how you think about free cash flow margins that we should just expect free cash flow margins to be at the lower end of the target range for the near- to medium-term? Rafael Lizardi : I\u2019ll take that question to a few angles, first, tactically second quarter, as we pointed out was, the revenue came in late in the quarter or a disproportionate amount of the revenue came in late. So that means that a lot of the cash was stuck in accounts receivable, as I talked about in the prepared remarks. So that\u2019s going to distort some of your trends from cash -- from a cash flow standpoint a little bit. Beyond that big picture, we are very excited about these investments in manufacturing and technology. They\u2019re going to continue to position us well for the long-term, given us the manufacturing platform that is needed to support revenue growth and that will have CapEx increase, as we have talked about in February. In fact, at that time, we talked about for the next four years, from 2020 to 2025 and average CapEx, that\u2019s an average of $3.5 billion per year. For this year, it looks like we\u2019re going to be coming in at about $2.5 billion, about as expected it could come in a little higher than that. And then, obviously, since the average is $3.5 billion, you would expect the subsequent years to then come in higher than that number. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Vivek. We\u2019ll go to the next caller, please. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. I wanted to ask about the supply side of the equation, you have a bunch of new facilities that are coming online. You talked about breaking ground in Sherman. But before that you have RFAB2 and then you have LFAB. So can you just talk to us about when does that capacity come online where it can be a tailwind to revenue and how should we think about the depreciation from those rolling in -- acknowledging, of course, that Rafael, you just told us we\u2019re going to have $1 billion for depreciation for this year as a whole? Rafael Lizardi : Correct. Correct. So, first, as I talked about earlier, we\u2019re very excited about these investments, RFAB2 and LFAB. We\u2019re going to have RFAB2 sometime in the second half of this year supporting production and LFAB early 2023. And then we -- on Sherman, we just broke ground on that a couple of months ago and we expect Sherman facility, the first factory there support revenue in 2025. So that\u2019s you want to think about it. From a depreciation standpoint, I just gave you the $1 billion for this year. Beyond that and I had already given you in February, to expect about $2.5 billion of depreciation by 2025 and then from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, you can roughly approximate that linearly between the end of 2022 to 2025 together tomorrow how the appreciation will likely come in. Dave Pahl : Do you have follow-on Ross? Ross Seymore : Yeah. Thanks for that color. I guess the final topical side, the Chips Act in the equivalent thereof in Europe. All the numbers you just gave, I assume are exclusive of those government policies? How should we think about TI taking advantage of those policies or not and maybe lowering some of those impacts financially on your company? Rafael Lizardi : So correct. The numbers that we have given you over the last six months or prior did not include any benefit from any of those bills. On the Chips Act specifically, is great to see strong bipartisan support of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing that will boost domestic chip production and improve the industry\u2019s ability to remain competitive. This provision will be meaningful and support our manufacturing roadmap. That bill hasn\u2019t passed yet. So as it -- when it passes, we\u2019ll be analyzing that and as we have said, the benefit that we\u2019ll get from that and we should be a beneficiary from both of the grant portion and the investment tax rate portion, but as we have said that in more detail we will provide you benefit -- updates as appropriate. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Ross. We will go to next caller. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Moore, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. I guess going back to the guidance that you had given in April when you talked about kind of maybe demand to support $5 billion in Q2 and then but you were taking it down to $4 billion or $5 billion, because of China lockdown. Can you just give us some sense of how much of that $500 million? Did you end up capturing how much of this upside reflects upside in other regions? Just put this in the context of that original adjustment? Dave Pahl : Yeah. I would say, as we said in the prepared remarks, Joe that customers were generally pulling with their original demand forecasts, right? So meaning that as we looked at what was going on, we started the quarter, we\u2019re tracking lower. But as we talked about last quarter, customers weren\u2019t canceling orders. They weren\u2019t rescheduling. They still wanted to have that product. So that\u2019s really what made up the majority of that, where we came in for the quarter. Does that help? Joe Moore : Yeah. That does. And then if you could just characterize your customers kind of mentalities around inventories at this point. Obviously, we\u2019ve been dealing with hotspots and tight conditions for a while, do you feel like your customers in industrial, automotive markets are looking to build buffer stock inventory, so that this is tempered? Again, just kind of how are people thinking about that? Dave Pahl : Yeah. I think many have reported and we can see in the filings that our customers have had, that there\u2019s clear signs of inventory being built over the last several quarters. And there is discussions on how much inventory do they hold more permanently and those types of things. We\u2019ll see how that behavior changes over time. I think there\u2019s some places where that probably will stick and probably some places where it won\u2019t. But I think the most important thing when we look at it, because we won\u2019t manage our customer\u2019s inventory, but we can manage what we do. And we\u2019ve long believed that owning and controlling our inventory is really a strategic advantage. So you\u2019ve seen us take those actions over time. We finished the quarter with just a little over $2 billion of inventory. So whenever things do weakened, we\u2019ll take that time to replenish inventories that will keep lead times stable and low. And those are the best things that we can control and what we\u2019ll do as we move through the next few quarters. So thank you, Joe. We\u2019ll go to next caller, please. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Danley with Citi. Please go ahead. Chris Danley : Hey. Thanks, guys. So, with the weakness in PE, but also the strength in auto and industrial, are you or can you take some of that capacity from the weaker parts and allocate it towards the stronger parts and if so, how long does that take? Rafael Lizardi : We -- of course, we do that constantly. At the highest level? Yes. We, the capacity is relatively fungible. There\u2019s always some nooks and crannies that are a little different for each technology or each particular part. So but at the highest level, yes. We are -- we have been adjusting our capacity over the last two months the things I\u2019ve been tied to deploy that to the best uses and support our long-term strategic roadmap. Dave Pahl : Do you have follow-up, Chris. Chris Danley : And for -- yes, for my follow up, sort of going along with that line of questioning. You guys have talked about shortages and extended lead times all year. Are we seeing any improvement or do you anticipate any improvement there before the end of the year? Dave Pahl : Yeah. I\u2019ll comment and Rafael if you want to jump in, please do. Our lead times haven\u2019t changed much from last quarter. I think as we look in the out quarters, it really depends on how demand begins to shape up. We will have capacity coming online as we\u2019ve talked about, but in any given quarter, sequentially, that\u2019s not going to make a huge difference. But we lap a year or several quarters and it really will make significant difference in the capacity that we\u2019ve got available. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. And I agree, it\u2019s all about increasing our supply. That\u2019s what we can control, right? So we\u2019ll be increasing that with RFAB2 coming online soon. LFAB shortly after that and then in 2025, the first of the four factories in Sherman, so that will increase our ability to supply the market. And by the way, as you can see, just -- we just put out $5.2 billion of revenue and grew inventory again, for I believe, the fourth consecutive quarter. So that gives you also a sense of the increased ability that we\u2019re developing to supply the market. Dave Pahl : That\u2019s right. Rafael Lizardi : That\u2019s a good point. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Chris. Now we\u2019ll go to the next caller, please. Chris Danley : Thanks, guys. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Toshiya Hari. Please go -- with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : Hi. Thanks so much. I had to as well. First, on your pricing strategy going forward, just curious with RFAB2 ramping and LFAB ramping over the next 12 months to 18 months and your peers much more supply constrained than you are and they\u2019re all sort of facing inflationary pressures from their foundry partners. Is there an opportunity for you to be a little bit more aggressive than then historical trends and for you to pursue market share or would you look to follow suit and raise pricing along with your peers going forward? Dave Pahl : Yeah. Yeah. Toshiya, thanks for that question. I would say, as you\u2019ve seen us behave in the past, our approach to pricing hasn\u2019t changed. These pricing decisions are made at the product line level. We\u2019ve got about 65 different product lines. They\u2019re close to customers, close to the market, understand what their peers in the industry are doing. So, and to your point, many of our peers in the market that are outsourced, they do have to take action, when they see pricing increases from their suppliers. So I think that just emphasizes the competitive advantage we have in manufacturing and technology, and continues to highlight that, part of the reason why we\u2019re continuing to invest to strengthen that competitive advantage. Do you have follow-on? Toshiya Hari : I do. Thanks, Dave. So on OpEx, I think, over the past four months, your OpEx budget is barely up, I think, it\u2019s up 1% -- 1% plus in what\u2019s been a very inflationary environment. Just curious what the offsets have been over the past four months and how should we think about sustainability in your model, OpEx being up kind of low singles, while revenue growing strong double digits? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. No. Happy to address that. We are pleased with how we\u2019re allocating our investments to R&D and SG&A to the best opportunities and that is primarily industrial and automotive. As we have talked about also initiatives, such as Ti.com that ultimately strengthen our competitive advantages and maximize our ability to grow free cash flow per share over the long-term. On the last part of your question, on an absolute basis, I would expect to increase investments over the next several years as we continue to see strong market opportunities. Dave Pahl : Thank you. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Appreciate it. Dave Pahl : We will go to next caller, please. Operator : We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking my question. On unfinished goods inventory, which is where your direct customer consignment inventory is resides. They are still 30% below pre-pandemic levels. They\u2019re down 3% versus last year. They are down slightly sequentially. Is it fair to assume that this is a reflection that your direct customers continue to pull at a very strong rate just given their demand profiles and can you guys get to your target inventory days exiting this year especially with RFAB2 ramping? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. What I would tell you, the given our manufacturing process, the process at web, then they go to kits, then they go to finish good. Overall inventory has been greatly pointed out over the last four quarters, this last quarter $140 million. Harlan, as you said, finished goods is still lean. Our goal is for inventory to continue to grow. We have talked about a target of $130 to 190 days and as I have said before, I will not be uncomfortable to be at the high end of that range, because ultimately that inventory gives us just tremendous optionality, puts us in a really good position to support customers and just given our business model, they lessens risk on the inventory is nil, because that inventory goes to support products that sell to many, many customers and have very long lives. So we feel comfortable increasing inventory for that reason. Dave Pahl : Yeah. And let me just add that, Harlan, part of your question was, is that a reflection of direct customers and just remind that we have 70% reductions last year, around 70% of our revenues direct, that includes\u2026 Harlan Sur : Right. Dave Pahl : \u2026 revenue going through TI.com, which we still believe is going to be a significant strategic asset for us as we move forward. And what goes through distribution to my prior combat, we long believed that owning and controlling that inventory is important. We\u2019re probably running two weeks or less than that inside of that. So, when we ship revenue, because we\u2019re owning and controlling that inventory, it really is reflective of what customers want inside of that quarter. So you have a follow on? Harlan Sur : Yeah. Thanks for the insights there. So I know it\u2019s shipped to location, but wanting to know what the year-over-year profiles look like for the different geographies? Thanks. Dave Pahl : Yeah. So inside of the quarter compared with a year ago, all the regions were up. That\u2019s the year-on-year and sequentially they were all up as well. So we did see those trends in both year-on-year and sequentially. So, thank you, Harlan, we\u2019ll go to the next caller, please. Harlan Sur : Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, revisiting an earlier question around the $560 million revenue beat versus the midpoint of your guide for June and the $500 million haircut that you took when you initially guided? So I\u2019m curious, given that you started to see recovery in May? Is it safe to say that maybe you went above and beyond kind of the run rate, and therefore, you recaptured all of that $500 million or was it just a portion of that? And then as part of that, where do you see upside relative to where you guided before, was that isolated to industrial or auto or any particular end market? Dave Pahl : Yeah. C.J. can you help me with the first part of your question? I\u2019m not sure I quite got it. Could you just ask it\u2026 C.J. Muse: So if I look at the midpoint of your guidance versus what you actually did, it was about $560 million better and in your initial guidance\u2026 Dave Pahl : Yeah. Yeah. C.J. Muse: \u2026 you told us a $500 million China uncertainty haircut. So really trying to understand, how that $560 million came in better? Was it all China or were there other drivers within that? Dave Pahl : Yeah. I would say that, as we talked about, right, that the haircut was, so to speak, using that that term was primarily due to the COVID restrictions. So, yeah, that -- as they loosened up, again, customers were pulling to those original forecasts, so we really didn\u2019t see anything different than what we would have expected at the beginning of the quarter, with the exception of the weakness that we talked about inside of personal electronics. Do you have follow on. C.J. Muse: Yeah. Please. On the depreciation guide for the year, roughly up 35% half-on-half and considering for RFAB2, you\u2019re going to start to depreciate the equipment when you actually qualify the wafers and begin revenuing, is that kind of a ballpark kind of estimate? And maybe it comes in more like $925 million, $950 million or just trying to understand the moving parts there given that it\u2019s qualification of wafers -- revenue of wafers, which sounds like it\u2019s really going to be later Q4 that really starts? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. It is an estimate and it could come in on a little lower or a little higher. But right now, I would say, $1 billion is a fair estimate. And as I said earlier, just to go beyond that, you can think about it roughly linear from that point in 2022 to $2.5 billion of depreciation in 2025 and then you can easily get the -- a good model for 2023 and 2024. C.J. Muse: Thank you, Rafael. Dave Pahl : Thank you, C.J. And we\u2019ve got time for one more caller, please. Operator : We\u2019ll take our last question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Securities. Please go ahead. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you very much. David I had a question. David and Rafael, I had a question on pricing. Industry pricing has been up high single-digit, low double, last couple of quarters. Did the second quarter see a similar benefit from pricing, Dave? I know last quarter you had acknowledged that you did see the benefit from pricing. So I was wondering, what was the impact and do you expect that to continue over the next couple of quarters? Dave Pahl : Yeah. We did see a benefit in second quarter, Ambrish. And again, our pricing practices haven\u2019t changed. So, we\u2019ll continue to price aggressively. And to ensure that we\u2019re gaining share and so no changes from that standpoint. So we\u2019ll just see what happens in the marketplace. Ambrish Srivastava : Dave, just a sorry, just a clarification. As imperfect, the SIA data is, is it the reasonable proxy to use to ascertain what pricing advantage TI got from whatever the SIA data spits up? Dave Pahl : Yeah. Yeah. So we\u2019re just cautious to give a specific number as we look at it. We\u2019ve got -- if you just took units and divided by revenue that would give you an average price, which is what SIA is doing. We\u2019ve got our customers that are buying through TI.com. They\u2019re enjoying the convenience of having product that\u2019s immediately available and in some regions we\u2019re doing shipments more than once a day to the docks of those customers. So there\u2019s a convenience that they\u2019re enjoying. They pay a higher price for that. But so you\u2019ve got that mixing in. So there\u2019s other factors besides that, there\u2019s mixing the types of products that we ship. We have products that we sell for a couple of pennies and products that we ship sell for thousands of dollars each and depending on either end of that spectrum, it can move your ASP or your average selling price around. So, but that said, in an environment like we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters, just in price increases that customers for like-on-like product that we have seen that that benefit as well. I am sorry I can\u2019t give any specific. Do you have a follow up or that makes it fine. Ambrish Srivastava : Okay. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thanks, Ambrish. Ambrish Srivastava : Thanks. Dave Pahl : So let me wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously. At our core, we\u2019re engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that\u2019s ever changing. And we will be a company that we\u2019re personally proud to be a part of and would want us our neighbors. When we\u2019re successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I am Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations and I am joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today\u2019s call is being recorded and you will be able to get it via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Today, we will provide the following updates. First, I will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I will provide insight into third quarter\u2019s revenue results with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our customers and markets. And lastly, Rafael will come to results and our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022. Starting with a quick overview of the third quarter, revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $5.2 billion, an increase of 1% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Analog revenue grew 13%, Embedded Processing grew 11%, and our Other segment grew 20% from the year ago quarter. Now I\u2019ll provide some insight into third quarter revenue by market. This quarter, I will focus on our sequential performance as it\u2019s more informative at this time. First, personal electronics declined mid-teens as we continue to see the weakness we described in the second quarter. Industrial was about even sequentially as we saw weakness begin to broaden in the industrial market. The automotive market remains strong and was about 10%. Next, communications equipment was up high single-digits. And finally, enterprise systems, was up mid single-digits. Turning to our expectations for the fourth, we expect that most of our end markets will decline sequentially with the exception of the automotive market. Lastly, we and our customers remain pleased with the progress of our expansion of our manufacturing capacity, which was outlined in our February capital management call and will support the long-term secular trend of increased semiconductor content per system. Customers especially value the geopolitically dependable footprint of our manufacturing additions. We are now in production in RFAB2 and expect production in LFAB later this year. In addition, construction of SM-1 and SM-2 in Sherman, Texas continues as planned. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave and good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned, third quarter revenue was $5.2 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.6 billion or 69% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 110 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $862 million, up 8% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.3 billion or 16% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $77 million in the third quarter and are associated with a LFAB factory that we purchased in October of last year. These charges will move to cost of revenue as we start production. The assets associated with the acquisition of the factory will begin to depreciate at the same time. Moving on, operating profit was $2.7 billion in the quarter or 51% of revenue. Operating profit was up 16% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $2.3 billion or $2.47 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.02 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $790 million in the quarter and $3.1 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $1 billion of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.1 billion in the past 12 months. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 8%, marking our 19th consecutive year of dividend increases. We also increased our share repurchase authorizations by $15 billion. These actions reflect our commitment to return of free cash flow to our owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. In the quarter, we issued $700 million in debt. Total debt outstanding was $8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.8%. Inventory dollars were up $205 million from the prior quarter to $2.4 billion and days were 133, up 8 days sequentially and below these higher levels. For the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.83 to $2. This outlook comprehends the market conditions that Dave previously mentioned. We continue to expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be about 14%. As you are looking at your models for 2023, without additional changes to tax law, we would expect our effective tax rate to remain above what it is in 2022 with a similar quarterly profile. Let me now make a few comments on the CHIPS Act that was recently signing to law. The combination of the investment tax credit, the grant as well as funding for research and development will help make the U.S. semiconductor industry more competitive. We accrued about $50 million on the balance sheet in third quarter due to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. factories. This will eventually flow some statement as lower depreciation and we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : Hi, thanks. Dave, I wonder if you can sort of go into any detail within distribution versus consignment? Maybe what I am trying to get at is sort of any differences in demand pull as measured by bookings inside distribution or demand pull from the consignment segment, is one better than the other? And also is there any cancellations inside of \u2013 into distribution? Dave Pahl : Yes. So on the first part, Tim, we didn\u2019t see really anything different between the direct business back going through distribution. As you know, we have had an effort over the past few years to have direct \u2013 close to direct relationships with our customers. So the amount of revenue going through distribution is much lower today. So probably only about 30% of our revenue actually goes through distribution. We did see cancellations increased in the quarters just as customers work to align the backlog to their needs. Do you have a follow-up? Operator : So we will take the next question from Vivek Arya, Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one, it seems like consumer electronics is your biggest area of headwinds in Q3, I think you said down mid-teens. And I imagine about the same kind of double-digit down in Q4. Do you think are we past the worst of the consumer or should we be expecting the seasonal decline again for consumer in Q1? I know it\u2019s a little bit further out, but I just wanted to check what you are seeing in terms of consumer right now. And I guess the bigger picture question there is, is TI more exposed to the cyclical downturn versus your peers, because you have the highest consumer exposure? And if that is the case, do you need to do something different, given that mix headwind? Dave Pahl : Yes, Vivek, thanks for that question and the opportunity to clarify. So, personal electronics last year was 24% of our revenue. If you look at the market overall, personal electronics, a little more than 50% of the semiconductor market without memory. So we have less than half of the exposure there. If you look at industrial and automotive, that makes up 62% of our revenues. And inside of the market, that\u2019s 26% of the market. So we are really highly exposed to both industrial and automotive and that\u2019s not by accident, is probably more than a decade ago, we began allocating more of our resources to automotive and industrial and the emphasis there. So we are very pleased with our exposure. And we believe that, that will be where there just will be more content added into those systems. Now that said, there is great opportunities inside of personal electronics, communications equipment and enterprise systems in the decades ahead, but we will just have those secular tailwinds more than average inside of industrial and automotive. Do you have a follow-on Vivek? Vivek Arya : Yes. Thank you, Dave. So kind of similar question, but on automotive, which you suggested grew 10% sequential in Q3. And interestingly, you are suggesting it can grow again in Q4. What\u2019s your sense of kind of the supply-demand balance in automotive among your Tier 1 and then the auto OEM customers? Many investors are concerned that the kind of rolling correction that we are seeing in semi is going to eventually hit automotive, which has been a very strong area over the last 1 to 2 years. So what\u2019s your sense of what kind of the supply-demand balance is in this automotive end market? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes. I\u2019d say first, I think when you look at the secular trends inside of automotive, I think all of us know that it will be a great grower for us and we are investing very broadly. So we are just thrilled with the position. If you look at the second quarter of 2020, our growth there has, off the bottom, been very, very strong. Will that market eventually roll over? It will. I mean, that\u2019s just what happens. And we are not trying to predict when that will happen, we will continue to ship product to customers as they request it. And we are really focused on making sure we have got capacity in place for them over the long-term. So we are not really trying to worry about when that will happen. So thank you, Vivek, and we will go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next question from Joshua Buchalter from Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Joshua Buchalter : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to double-click on the industrial market. Did anything change materially through the quarter? Anything you can give us on linearity or by geography? As we think about what\u2019s baked into the guide, is it more, I guess, conservatism on the macro or was there really a material change in your customers\u2019 order patterns? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes, Josh, thanks for that question. I would say if you look at the third quarter results across the board and also inclusive of industrial, the quarter came in as we had expected. If you look at \u2013 and even sequential is not unusual inside of industrial, that\u2019s about what we were expecting. But as we described, the weakness began to broaden into that. So there wasn\u2019t one place that we could put the finger on to say it was one thing or one group of customers, but we did see just different signals inside of there that is leading us to that conclusion that it is \u2013 that weakness is broadening. And in fact, we expect that weakness to broaden into most of the other markets as well as we move into fourth quarter, of course, with the exception of auto. So that\u2019s really what we are seeing, it\u2019s order rates. If you look at order rates quarter-to-date, they are of course consistent with our outlook, but they are weak quarter-to-date. And so it\u2019s those types of signals that are leading to the outlook. And really, those are the types of signals that really best inform what our shipments in the quarter and in the short-term are going to be. Do you have a follow-up, Joshua? Joshua Buchalter : Yes. Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful. I also wanted to clarify the comments on the CHIPS Act. You mentioned $50 million was accrued on the balance sheet. Was that from the investment tax credit only? Because I know there is a second bucket for manufacturing incentives. And if not, when should \u2013 when would you expect to, I guess, get more clarity on how much you\u2019ll be able to accrue for the manufacturing incentive portion of the CHIPS Act? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So first, let me step back. Big picture, the combination of the investment actually the grant as well as the funding for research and development will help. U.S. semiconductor are more competitive. We accrued the $50 million that we talked about in the prepared remarks that you referred to, that was for the 25% investment tax credit that is for manufacturing assets that will go into service in 2023 and beyond. And that is \u2013 that was for $200 million. So quarter of that is what we accrued that we will receive from the government at some point in the future as lower taxes. But in the P&L, it flows. It will flow through lower depreciation. I think maybe what you\u2019re referring to when you talk about manufacturing is the grant portion. Is that what you\u2019re referring to? Well, maybe answer them. But if you are talking about the grant that is part of the CHIPS Act, but it\u2019s separate from the investment tax credit that remains to be seen as more. We will apply for those, the application window doesn\u2019t open until February. So we will apply for those. And as we learn more, we will let you know. And big picture, when we get to February, the next capital management call, we will talk about the chipset, the overall investment will try to quantify that and what benefit we will get. At the same time, since the last capital management call, our confidence around the long-term growth prospects in our industry, the secular trends that Dick talked about earlier. That confidence has only grown, so we feel really good about that. So we will tell you about the net impact between those two, the benefits of the chip stack and the growing confidence at the next capital management call and any changes to our numbers based on that. So I think you dropped off. Dave Pahl : Thank you. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : We will take the follow-up from Timothy Arcuri, UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot Dave for let me come back in. So my follow-up was on China. And I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about your business there. Are you seeing any signs of pull-ins or push-outs as a result of some of these bands. Are you seeing any changes sort of in the linearity around the bands getting announced? And I think also, you had talked about China being like high teens of consumption of your product. Is that still where you see it? Thanks. Dave Pahl : So \u2013 and Rafael, maybe you want to add to it. But on the bands, that the recent changes in some of the bands, there were companies added to the entities list overall. We don\u2019t expect that there is really much, if any, impact due to those changes really to that or in any of the restrictions from overall from that. Anything to add on that? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, correct. 99% of our parts fall on the very lowest category of restrictions, just given the nature of the types of parts that we sell. So we don\u2019t have restrictions on those. Of course, there are restrictions specific to entities. There is the entity lease that you hear about, the FDP, that\u2019s another list. And we, of course, follow all the regulations when it comes to that. So when an entity goes listed in there, we take that into account and restrict shipments as according to the law. But given how that works, we don\u2019t expect any meaningful or significant impact to our revenue with those export loss. Dave Pahl : Yes. And that was the first part of your question, Tim. The second part you had mentioned high teens, it\u2019s actually about 25% of our revenue comes from customers that are based in China. So that\u2019s the number. Thank you, Tim. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Next one from Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first one, I just wanted to verify, are there any changes to the trajectory of the near to medium-term CapEx plan just given changes in the current environment? And I guess related to that, the Lehi headwinds that are coming, do you have any of those embedded in Q4? Because you said it\u2019s coming online starting in Q4. And I\u2019m getting implied gross margins down a few hundred basis points sequentially. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So let me answer the first one \u2013 the last one first. So you see on our P&L, about $77 million of restructuring charges in third quarter, that is all because of \u2013 those are the Lehi costs that we chosen to put in there before it qualifies once it qualifies that cost will move to cost of revenue. So it will move to gross margin. Stacy Rasgon : Is that in Q4, though? Does that happen in Q4 or Q1? Rafael Lizardi : Well, it will happen during Q4. Of course, not changing. It doesn\u2019t affect EPS. So it\u2019s just going to move \u2013 and we don\u2019t guide the specific lines, right? But if it qualifies in December 1, third of that will go into COR and then all of it will be there for first quarter, right? If you qualify December 31, then all of it will be in restructuring in fourth quarter, and then all of it will move in first quarter. Dave Pahl : Just to clarify, that\u2019s already in profit. In third quarter, it\u2019s been there. It\u2019s just moving above the lines into the gross profit. Rafael Lizardi : Into gross profit. It\u2019s being in profit from operations the entire time all of this year. The first part of your question, big picture, we will give you an update in about 4 months at the capital management with all the puts and takes. But what I would tell you is that \u2013 well, short-term, we expect our change \u2013 our CapEx expectation for 2022 have not changed. That is $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion for this year; depreciation, about $1 billion for this year. I\u2019m talking 2022. Bigger picture, as I said earlier, the CHIPS Act, great legislation. We\u2019re very excited about that. That is going to decrease on a net basis. our investment because we\u2019re going to get a 25% reduction from the investments that qualified and manufacturing investments in the United States. But on the other hand, as I alluded to earlier, our confidence around our long-term growth prospects have only grown over the last 6 to 12 months based on the secular trends based on input from our customers. So we feel really excited about that. The net effect of those two and whatever that does to our CapEx plans, we will tell you about that in February. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-on, Stacy? Stacy Rasgon : I do. Thank you. I wanted to ask about OpEx. So it\u2019s been running in the $800 million range, plus or minus, for quite a while. And frankly, people are wondering how you\u2019ve been keeping it there. in such an inflationary environment. It is now ticking up, but it\u2019s picking up as revenues are falling. I guess why is it increasing now where is it did increase before and what happens going forward? Because if I would just hold it flat on the revenue guide going forward to do something like 19% of revenue, so it is still below your kind of what you\u2019ve talked about in terms of long-term targets for OpEx. So how do we think about that? Why is it growing now versus before? And how do we think about where the range might go going forward? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So here\u2019s how we think about it. Step back, for the last 5.5 years, really, we\u2019ve been running OpEx on a trailing 12-month basis, which is how I prefer to look at it at $3.2 billion. Pretty consistently, we\u2019re really steady hand over that time. Our hiring has been very consistent during that time. And that is underpinned by our long-term expectations on growth. And inside of that, R&D has actually moved up. SG&A has moved down inside of that $3.2 billion, but it\u2019s been really consistent on that. This last quarter for the first time, it ticked up to $3.3 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. And I would expect that to continue ticking up over the next many quarters and years as we continue stepping up our investments. And that is a, driven by the higher investments, but inflation is playing a factor. It\u2019s clearly wage inflation. We\u2019re not immune to that. So that is also affecting and will continue to affect those trends. Dave Pahl : Okay, thanks, Stacy. We will go to the next caller. Thank you. Operator : We have Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Blayne Curtis : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had two. Maybe just a clarification, though, on Stacy\u2019s question because you said, but I didn\u2019t hear anything negative to net off of two positives. So I\u2019m just kind of curious, and I guess we will see what March brings, and I\u2019m happy if you want to comment on that. But it seems like at least personal electronics is back to where you were in \u201819, \u201820. It seems like industrial is going to kind of get back there. And at that point, you\u2019re building inventories. You had more capacity than demand. So if we do go back to those levels and you\u2019re adding more capacity, I\u2019m just trying to understand is still the view that you\u2019ll build inventory like you do in \u201819 and \u201820 and still roll out the capacity for the long-term. Rafael Lizardi : Let me try and answer that. Frankly, I didn\u2019t fully understand. You threw in several premises there. But let me just address the best way I can enable and capacity. So capacity, we\u2019ve been adding capacity incrementally for a number of quarters. Now our Fab 2 is in production. Lehi is about to start production within a few months. So clearly, our incremental capacity is going up. At the same time, we\u2019ve been increasing inventory very slowly. And now more recently, we added $200 million of inventory in this last quarter, but we are still below these higher levels. Okay. Keep in mind, our business model is such where we are targeting the vast major of our parts sell to many, many customers. So they are very broad in nature. The product life cycles of the parts is decades in many times, the products themselves last 10 years in inventory, most of them. So the risk of selection for the inventory is very, very low. The potential upside of having that inventory ready is very high. So that\u2019s why we prefer to have more than less inventory. So I would not be uncomfortable, as I said before, adding another $1 billion, $1.5 billion of inventory over the next several quarters to get us well positioned for the next upturn that invariably comes at some point. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-on, Blayne? Blayne Curtis : Thanks. And I just want to ask you specifically on the auto segment. You said that\u2019s the only one that\u2019s not down. And obviously, it\u2019s very well known that it\u2019s been so tight. But just any more comments on why that market is taking a bit longer than, say, industrial to correct? Dave Pahl : Yes. I think \u2013 as well documented, I think as we went through the pandemic, it had the deepest correction from a starting point standpoint. The mix of auto manufacturers to the high end. You\u2019ve got EVs that are inside of those mix that are all adding to that to those secular trends. So I think that we\u2019re well positioned as we make investments across our businesses. We\u2019re investing in powertrain, which would include electric vehicles and hybrid. We\u2019re investing in ADAS systems. We\u2019re investing in infotainment systems. We\u2019re investing in body and lighting. That doesn\u2019t get talked about a lot on conference calls where we get excited about turn signals, as we do about BMS systems. And then we also invest in safety systems. So we are growing very broadly. We\u2019ve got close to 1,000 different automotive OEMs that we service. And we really believe that we\u2019ve got probably decades of growth ahead of us that we\u2019re preparing for. So, thank you, Blayne. Now we will go to the next call please. Operator : We have Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Thanks for let me ask q question. A high-level one on your Analog business. Year-to-date, I think it\u2019s 15% year-over-year with the midpoint-ish of your guidance. It seems like this year might be up about 10%. That\u2019s roughly half of what the broader market is running at. Can you guys explain a little bit about why you would be undergoing the market as defined by SIA? And if you are, is that something that you expect to mean revert? Because you don\u2019t \u2013 you lose this amount of share in a year unless there is something unique going on. So any help in explaining that would be great. Dave Pahl : Yes, sure. I think that whenever I\u2019m asked that question, and it\u2019s always a lot more comfortable to be answering it when were up twice the rate of the market. You really need to look at it over a longer period of time. So look at the rate of growth of us versus the industry from fourth quarter of \u201819. I just picked that because it\u2019s a pre-pandemic number. And we look very, very good against those numbers. So we were, as you remember, as we went into the pandemic, we continued to build inventory. So the numbers initially looked very, very strong as customers pulled product from us. So when you look some of the sequentials were harder, and that\u2019s not making excuses. But when you look at our manufacturing footprint and how we are positioned, you look at the customer excitement around that manufacturing footprint and customers look at where that addition is coming and the geopolitical dependable locations of where that footprint is coming on. We are very confident in where the trajectory of our market share is going longer term. So, you got a follow-up, Ross? Ross Seymore : I do. I just want to revisit the gross margin side. Not going into whether the Lehi charges are moving into COGS or not. But are there any other moving parts? Because it appears at the midpoint of your revenue guide and your earnings guide if OpEx is roughly the same sequentially that the gross margin would have to go down, better part of 2 points or 3 points. I just wanted to know if there is any other unique aspects implied in that guidance. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. No, I would tell you, we are very pleased with our gross margin performance. On a year-on-year basis, the third quarter that we just finished is \u2013 the fall-through was 12%, and that is actually higher than the guidance that we have given $70 million to $75 million. What I would point you to is, as you can see in the cash flow statement, depreciation is increasing sequentially, has increased sequentially actually for a number of quarters. So, this last quarter, $20-some million. Of course, that is a direct result of the CapEx investments that we are making. And so you should expect depreciation to continue ticking up. I said earlier in the call, we expect this year to be close to $1 billion. So, you can obviously then do the math and get fourth quarter depreciation there. But clearly, that is picking up and the bulk of that depreciation goes into cost of revenue. Ross Seymore : Thank you. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Ross and we will go to the next caller please. Operator : Next One is Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Joe Moore : Yes. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about if the lead time environment has changed? I know you have talked about there being hotspots in the past few quarters. Has that gone now, or your delinquencies kind of back to below normal levels, or where are you out with that? Dave Pahl : Yes. So, we still do have hotspots, in any market environment we have got hotspots. But we still do have them probably still most pronounced inside of automotive. Lead times didn\u2019t change much second quarter to third quarter. And at the same time, as we have talked about before, customers can get immediate availability of products on ti.com. So, you have kind of all those dynamics going on. Do you have a follow-up, Joe. Joe Moore : Yes. Thank you for that. We are hearing from some of your industrial and automotive customers desire to hold higher safety stock than what companies have historically held. Is that something that you guys see? Is that \u2013 I mean do you think it might affect TI? And just how do you think about that going forward? Do you think that\u2019s a normal state of affairs? Dave Pahl : Yes. We have seen and heard and been in those discussions before. We know that some customers that are really taking a hard look at their supply chains, where their product is coming from, what technologies they are being built on, ensuring that they have got supply of those technologies. That\u2019s part of the reason why, when they look at product being built and the capacity we are putting in place at the 45 nanometer to 130 nanometer. They know they need that capacity for decades to come. So, they get excited about when they see that capacity overall. But to change supply, the supply chains is really hard work. It will take a long time to be able to do it. And it\u2019s not oftentimes just as simple as carrying more inventory on the balance sheet. So, there probably will be some of those customers that do that hard work and restructure the supply chains. And there probably will be some that once we get supply and demand imbalance, so it just kind of fall back into normal practices. So, I think time will tell as that plays out. And Rafael, do you have\u2026 Rafael Lizardi : Yes. No, I will just add. At the end of the day, customers will do what they want to do, right. And of course, if they want to hold more inventory, they are welcome to do that. What we believe is that for us to hold more inventory, we are in a great position to do that, given the nature of that inventory that it\u2019s catalog in nature that can sell to many, many customers. So, we are all better off, and our customers will be better off when we hold more of that inventory, and we can direct it where it\u2019s most needed. So, that\u2019s why, as I said earlier, we \u2013 our goal is to continue growing inventory. We are still below these higher levels, and we will add significantly more inventory over the quarters to come, be ready for the next upside. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Joe and we will go to the next caller please. Operator : We will take William Stein from Truist Security. Your line is open. Please go ahead. William Stein : Hi. Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about ti.com. In past quarters, I think maybe even a quarter ago, you talked about how percent of revenue from that channel had gone from less than 1% of sales to over 10%. I think that occurred in about a 1-year timeframe. You just mentioned a moment ago, Dave, that this is the channel where customers can go for the immediate availability. So, I would assume that they get that availability at a price and that when things start softening as you are alluding to on this call that perhaps that channel sees a more precipitous decline. Did we see that during the quarter? And do you anticipate that to happen in the coming quarter or two quarters? Dave Pahl : Yes. And we did see a decline there. And we will finish up the year and provide an update on our capital management. And how it did for the year, won\u2019t be something that we will be reporting out on a quarterly basis, but there was a decline there, and not that it was unexpected, so. Rafael Lizardi : Now, longer term, it\u2019s a fantastic channel to engage customers on a number of levels and customers are very pleased. So, there will be fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, maybe even year-to-year. But over the long-term, we are very pleased with that channel and what it\u2019s doing to get us even more directly engaged with customers. Dave Pahl : Absolutely. Do you have a follow-on, Will? William Stein : Yes. Sort of along the same lines, there has been some speculation in the press, for example, that this has been a channel for companies that you might call brokers or some people call it the gray market of distribution to get their hands on TI product, and that perhaps there is still inventory that was acquired by such parties that is still sort of floating around and waiting to be sold on to end customers. I wonder whether you have found a better reason to maybe track that and measure it, and any observations you have made with regard to that? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes. And well, as you know, I spent 8 years in my career in sales, and there have always been brokers in our market. And as Rafael talked about, we have long believed that owning and controlling our inventory is a strategic advantage. So, in having policies of like non-cancelable orders and things like that, as customers take product that they don\u2019t need, that\u2019s typically the source of that product going out the back door for brokers. So, can brokers go on to ti.com and get products, they can. But that\u2019s pretty minimal in comparison to other sources that they might be able to get it. So, overall, the majority of customers that we service are customers that we have large engagements with directly. Thank you and we will go the next caller, please. Operator : We will take C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a question on end markets into December. If I adjust the down 12% sequential for the strength in auto, it looks like all your other businesses are tracking at least down kind of mid-teens. So, curious what parts of the market are down seasonally? I would think the other \u2013 the calculators would be one. And what are \u2013 what\u2019s maybe more down cyclically in terms of the correction that you are seeing? Dave Pahl : And C.J., just to clarify, you are talking about the fourth quarter guidance? C.J. Muse: Yes. Dave Pahl : Yes. So, again, we are not trying to provide guidance by quarter or by each market inside of that. We are obviously, with the guide overall, it is a weaker fourth quarter than a typical fourth quarter. So, with the exception of auto, as we have talked about, that we will continue to see weakness inside of personal electronics, but we will see the other markets weaken as well. So, we are not trying to get specific on that. So, we will finish up the quarter and report that out. But we do expect the weakness to broaden across those markets. Do you have a follow-on? C.J. Muse: Yes, please. I guess as a follow-on question to China and obviously, you talked about very little impact from the embargo on your business. But curious as you contemplate China\u2019s ability to invest in the lagging edge and I am assuming it will take years, if not decades, to try to compete in high-performance analog. But just curious how your thoughts are evolving for China as a competitor to you in the coming decades? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, I will start. Dave, you want to chime in. But I would tell you, at the end of the day, it all comes down to our competitor advantages, right. And it starts with the broad portfolio that we have in the analog and embedded space, you need a huge portfolio to compete effectively, particularly in industrial and automotive. And we have 80,000 or so parts that we sell to 100,000 different customers. So, you need that type of diversity. Then second is manufacturing and technology. These investments that are positioned 300-millimeter, first, but then all the investments that we are making are just building on that, right. So, we have RFAB2 coming, that just came online. Our new factory in Lehi and the mega site that we just broke ground in Sherman that\u2019s going to have four factories, each one the size of RFAB2. So, that really puts us in a very strong position to compete against anyone, whether it\u2019s in the United States or in China, okay. Dave Pahl : Thank you, C.J. With that, we will wrap it up, and Rafael? End of Q&A: Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So, let me wrap it up. At our core, we are engineers, and technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that\u2019s ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s event. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Dave Pahl : Welcome to the Texas Instruments' Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the \"Notice regarding forward-looking statements\" contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. First, you likely saw last week we announced that Haviv Ilan will become President and CEO on April 1st and that Rich Templeton will continue as our Chairman. I'm sure you'll want to join me in congratulating both of them. Secondly, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. Next week on Thursday, February 2nd, at 10 :00 a.m. Central time, we will have our capital management call. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insights into our business and our approach to capital allocation. This will include an update of our 300 millimeter capacity expansion plans to support the increasing confidence that we have in our long-term growth. Moving on, today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results, with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our customers and markets. I will then provide an annual summary of our revenue breakout by end market. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for first quarter of 2023. Starting with a quick overview. Revenue was $4.7 billion, a decrease of 11% sequentially and 3% from the same quarter a year ago. As expected, our results reflect weaker demand in all end markets with the exception of automotive. A component of the weaker demand was customers working to reduce their inventories. In first quarter, we expect a weaker than seasonal decline, with the exception of automotive, as we believe customers will continue to reduce inventory levels. Turning to our segments, fourth quarter Analog revenue declined 5% year-over-year and Embedded Processing grew 10%. Our Other segment declined 11% from the year-ago quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. I'll focus on sequential performance again this quarter, as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down about 10%. The automotive market was up mid-single digits with strength in most sectors. Personal electronics was down mid-teens with broad-based weakness. Next, communications equipment was down about 20%, and finally, enterprise systems was also down about 20%. Lastly, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2022. We break our end markets into six categories that are grouped by their life cycles and market characteristics. The six end markets are industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for 2022, industrial was 40%, automotive about 25%, personal electronics 20%, communications equipment 7%, enterprise systems 6%, and other was 2%. In 2022, industrial and automotive combined made up 65% of TI's revenue, up about three percentage points from 2021 and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technologies to make their end products smarter, safer, more connected and more efficient. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application, which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave. And good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was $4.7 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.1 billion, or 66% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, increased capital expenditures and the transition of LFAB-related charges to cost of revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 320 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $863 million, up 9% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.4 billion, or 17% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $48 million in the fourth quarter and were associated with the LFAB factory preproduction costs. As production started at the beginning of December, these costs then transitioned to cost of revenue, where they will be reflected moving forward. In addition, depreciation has begun on these assets. Operating profit was $2.2 billion in the quarter, or 47% of revenue. Operating profit was down 13% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter was $2.0 billion, or $2.13 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.11 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.0 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.0 billion in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion, down 6% from a year ago. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $848 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.9 billion in the past 12 months to owners. We also increased our dividend per share by 8% in the fourth quarter, marking our 19th year of dividend increases. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. In the quarter we issued $800 million in debt. Total debt outstanding was $8.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.93%. Inventory was up $353 million from the prior quarter to $2.8 billion, and days were 157, up 24 days sequentially. Next, to summarize the benefits of the CHIPS Act, we accrued about $350 million on our balance sheet under long-term assets in fourth quarter, in addition to the $50 million accrued in the third quarter. These accruals are due to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. factories. This will eventually flow through our income statement as lower depreciation, and we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future. Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2022, cash flow from operations was $8.7 billion. Capital expenditures were $2.8 billion, or 14% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2022 was $5.9 billion, or 30% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.17 billion to $4.53 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.90. We now expect our 2023 annual effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll first hear from Chris Caso of Credit Suisse. Chris Caso : Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess, the first question is, if you could just maybe characterize what you're seeing going to Q1, you're talking about that being worse than seasonal. Is that also broadly based in terms of the decline as you've seen in Q4? And I know you don't guide by segment, but any kind of color you could provide by segment as to what you're seeing and the extent to which customers are burning inventory as you know into the first quarter? Dave Pahl : Yes, Chris, thanks for that question. I'd say that the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter will continue into first, meaning that we expect our end markets to decline with the exception of automotive. So automotive is continuing to be resilient. And we do believe, as you just said, that the customers are continuing to work to get their inventories lower. So you have a follow-on? Chris Caso : I do. Thank you. I wonder if you could speak about the pace of depreciation expenses as you go through next year. You spoke about RFAB and I know it started production and it's hitting depreciation now. Is there additional incremental depreciation coming from RFAB as you go through the year. What happens to LFAB as you, I guess, maybe the timing of that when that starts production and start hitting depreciation? And then how should we think about some of the benefits that come from CHIPS Act that tend to decrease depreciation over time. I'm sure you're going to speak about that on the Capital Day coming up as well. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Let me take that, and we're going to go through all of that, both the CapEx, depreciation and ITC and the CHIPS Act in great detail next week. For now, what I would tell you is, as you said, RFAB2 is in production, Lehi is in production. So both of those are running that cost now is in cost of revenue, and they\u2019re both depreciating and that that is a function of the \u2013 when the equipment is placed in service, it starts depreciating, right? So as both of those ramps, the equipment goes in service starts depreciating. But big picture, what we told you last year on depreciation was that it would ramp roughly linearly to about $2.5 billion in 2025. And again, we\u2019ll give you an update on that next week, but I do want to say just as I said 90 days ago, that since we talked about this last year, our confidence surrounding our long-term growth prospects have only grown. And if you alluded to, we\u2019ve had the CHIPS Act also since last year that, that legislation pass in August. So we\u2019ll \u2013 next week, we\u2019ll give you the \u2013 all the puts and takes between those trends and we\u2019ll paint a clearer picture at that point. Chris Caso : Yeah. Dave Pahl : And maybe just add a small piece that linear ramp will go from about $1 billion a depreciation that we had this year at about $0.5 billion a year till we get to $2.5 billion, so just kind of doing the math for you. So thanks, Chris, and we\u2019ll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll hear from Chris Danely of Citi. Chris Danely : All right. It\u2019s the Chris Brothers. Hey guys, so Dave, I believe you said that your confidence in the long-term growth rate has only increased. Maybe just share with us what you\u2019ve seen in the last three months to six months that\u2019s giving you that confidence. Do you expect the, I guess non-auto markets to bounce back this year? And conversely, would you expect auto to cool off or to remain strong all year? Dave Pahl : Yes. I \u2013 and I \u2013 again, that\u2019s \u2013 thanks for the question, Chris. It \u2013 the longer-term growth rates are really we\u2019re speaking to how things are going to grow over the next three and five and 10 years. And that higher confidence comes from the higher semiconductor content growth that we\u2019re seeing particularly in industrial and automotive. And the fact that that those two markets now make up two-thirds of our revenue. So just as that structurally grows faster than the rest of the market, we\u2019re convinced more than ever that that will continue to drive our top line and also the products that we have inside of those markets. And I\u2019d say also the strong customer response we\u2019re getting to our geopolitically dependable capacity. So since we\u2019ve shared publicly our plans last February in capital management call, I just say that, that the response has been very, very strong. So those are really the three things that are adding to our confidence. You have a follow-up? Chris Danely : Yes. One on inventory. So it\u2019s bouncing up towards your long-term target. Can you talk about when you would start to ease back utilization rates to maintain that inventory? And then maybe spend a little bit of time on the mix. I know there\u2019s still shortages out there. How do you think \u2013 how long do you think it\u2019ll take to, I guess, balance out your inventory this year to achieve some sort of ideal mix? Dave Pahl : Yes. So let me take that. And first, big picture let me point you to our scorecard. The one that we used for capital management when we talked about the objectives in \u2013 when it comes to inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, keeping stable lead times while minimizing inventory obsolescence, our strategy and our portfolios such that it\u2019s long-lived a very diverse, our customer base. So the risk of obsolescence is very low. So that\u2019s a part of the equation. And the other part is the upside that we get by having that inventory both short-term and long-term to support customers. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable holding higher levels of inventory. I\u2019ve been talking about from current levels we could add a $1 billion to $2 billion of additional inventory. And the timing, that all depends on revenue trends. So if they\u2019re higher, then it\u2019ll take longer. If those serving trends are a little weaker, then it\u2019ll be a little faster to get there. On the mix is a number of angles on that, chip stock versus finished goods, we have a mix of both of those. In some cases, it makes sense to have more of one than the other, but they\u2019re both very low risk. So that\u2019s how we think about it. Chris Danely : Great. Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes. We\u2019ll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hey, how\u2019s it going? Thank you so much for taking the question. Dave, hoping you guys could talk a little bit about trends in China, what you saw in Q4, if there was any choppiness toward the end of the quarter, and more importantly, how you\u2019re thinking about Q1 and beyond. I guess, there\u2019s hope out there that China as an economy bounces back in 2023. Are you guys seeing any early signs of a recovery in terms of end consumption of your products? Dave Pahl : Yes, I\u2019d say, some of the disruptions that we saw earlier in the year, we didn\u2019t see any of that here in the fourth quarter. And so nothing exceptional to report with China as a region versus the other regions. And we long held the practice that we call it out if there\u2019s something going on. So really nothing exceptional. And certainly, as that economy comes back and consumption increases in China, obviously helping the world GDP, but that would obviously help us as well. It was what we would expect. So you have a follow-on? Toshiya Hari : Yes, I do. Your analog business in the quarter was down 5% year-to-year and obviously you guys are the first to report. So it\u2019s hard for us to compare and contrast. How you guys did relative to your competition or your peer group. But it feels like you may have underperformed in the quarter, and I realize it\u2019s only one quarter. What\u2019s the competitive landscape like today? What kind of pricing trends are you seeing as demand patterns start to soften? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes. I\u2019ll take that question and Rafael, if you want like to add. But I think certainly looking at any particular quarters we\u2019ve talked about before that our performance is just best measured over time. And I think that that\u2019s the way the markets behave and even looking at one year or even longer, you\u2019ve got to look at three and five and 10 years of performance especially when you go through choppy times like we\u2019ve been through in the last 18 months or so. And so pricing just to comment on that, I\u2019d say that there\u2019s nothing unusual going on with pricing. As you know, pricing doesn\u2019t move quickly in our markets, our practices and pricing though I know that they\u2019ve changed with many of our peers, our practices have not changed. We just continue to price aggressively in the marketplace, but pricing isn\u2019t the reason why customers choose our product. There\u2019s usually not the top few reasons why they choose our product. So really no changes on that front. So thank you for those questions, and we\u2019ll go to the next caller. Operator : Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Harlan Sur : Hello, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In the last earnings call, the team talked about seeing increasing cancellations. Did cancellations continue to increase through Q4? Did they level off? And then we are consignment-based business, what are the aggregate trends that you are seeing within your customers six to nine months, sort of rolling forecast? Dave Pahl : Yes. Harlan, so the first question is, in a weakening environment, not too surprising. The cancellations were up in the quarter. So we did see an increase there. And from a consignment versus classic backlog, customers really not much difference there. Their visibility \u2013 even though we\u2019ll get visibility out six months, their visibility to their demand can change, as we know very rapidly within the 90 days or certainly even within 30 days as those windows move a long time. So I would say that there\u2019s not much changed in that. And oftentimes if customers aren\u2019t canceling orders, what they\u2019re doing is rescheduling them back out in time. So certainly seeing that happen as well. Do you have a follow on? Harlan Sur : Yeah. So embedded drove 10% year-over-year growth in the second half of last year, it also drove slight sequential growth in the fourth quarter. So the business is holding up relatively well versus analog. And I know that the team seems to have moved past some of the headwinds in this segment as you\u2019ve sort of focused investments on selective markets and opportunities, right? Is that refocusing, like helping the near-term trends in embedded? And with all of the restructuring, how do you think about the forward opportunities and growth outlook for embedded over the next few years? Dave Pahl : Yes, yes. Thanks. Great, great question. Thank you for it. Yes, first I would just say that our efforts having impact, they are. And I would just say that we\u2019re  pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making there with embedded. And we believe that progress in those results just need to be measured again over time. So, we continue to work on that business and we\u2019ll continue to do that. When we think about the market opportunity for embedded and analog, we think that both of those markets have about the same growth opportunities. So in time the growth rates will converge, though they could be \u2013 you could see differences in any given quarter. But longer term, we believe that they can grow at the same rates. So thank you. And Harlan will go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Dave, I had a question about just the analog business generally, both with respect to share and margins. The margins are quite a bit lower than in early 2021 on quite a bit more revenue. I guess, is that all just still supply chain related costs? And do we get that back at some point? And then on share, just in that same point, the share, we don\u2019t know what the \u2013 all of the calendar fourth quarter looks like, but it\u2019s pretty clear that the share is going to be down about 150 basis points this year, and you\u2019re kind of back to 2012 levels. So I just wonder kind of what\u2019s going on there? Is there some pricing issue that might explain why that share would be down so much? Thanks, Dave. And then I have a follow up. Rafael Lizardi : Let me go ahead and start. Yes, let me address first on your margin question. Analog is a huge portion of the company. So anything you\u2019re seeing in analog is what you\u2019re seeing at the company level. And when it comes to gross profit, we\u2019re very pleased with the results you came in about as expected. And decreases, as we said in the prepared remarks, it decreased primarily due to lower revenue, the transition of LFAB-related cost to a cost of revenue, as well as the cost related to increased investments over the last several quarters that are now flowing through the P&L. And those are long-term investments that are going to position us very well for top-line growth for many, many years to come. And on this, the second part of the question, I think Dave already answered, you go to look at this over a long time, not any one quarter and particularly during choppy times. So, stay tuned on that. Dave Pahl : Yes, and I\u2019ll just add that I think our approach to building closer relationships with customers has served us well. As you know, we\u2019ve moved and taken more of our revenue direct as well as providing services through ti.com. So it\u2019s provided a lot of advantages including, as being better able to see and respond to changes in demand. And you know as customers are reducing their inventories now, we haven\u2019t employed any long-term sales agreements or non-cancelable, non-reschedulable contracts, really just focused on customers, and trying to meet their needs and service them well for the long-term. I think all those things has us in a position where we do believe that we\u2019re able to grow the top-line faster over the next few years. And as we talked about, we\u2019ll give you some insight into that next week, and how that\u2019s going to change some of our plan. So was that Tim\u2019s follow up, or, you have a follow up, Tim? Timothy Arcuri : I do Dave. I do Dave, thanks. So just a comment that autos grow in Q1. Is that a year-over-year comment? Or you expect autos to be up on a Q-on-Q basis, also in Q1? Thanks. Dave Pahl : Yes. So year-on-year, automotive was up about 30%. And just put that in context from fourth quarter 2019. I just picked that because it\u2019s pre-pandemic levels are \u2013 revenues in auto are up in the mid-70%s [ph]. So we continue to see strong growth there. So that\u2019s the year-on-year. The comment that we made before that it was up mid single-digits it was the sequential comment, Tim. Rafael Lizardi : Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi, thank you very much, Dave. I\u2019ll just stay with autos. So it\u2019s interesting data point versus the pre-pandemic. But I\u2019m just looking at the auto business and the rest of the business everything is decelerating as you would expect, and auto seems to be, if not accelerating, kind of in that high-20%s, 30% range. I just wanted your perspective on, what\u2019s your sense? Usually all these things are pretty interconnected and maybe it\u2019s a quarter or two quarters before everything going to follows the same cadence. So, we\u2019d just love to get some perspective from you guys on the disparity between autos and the rest of the broader businesses. Dave Pahl : Yes. Ambrish, thanks. I\u2019d say that as we \u2013 you almost have to go back to the beginning of the pandemic and how revenues behaved as we went through first quarter and into second and third. And if you remember, as the pandemic spread in third quarter, we saw wide and very deep cancellations across all of the markets including automotive. But as we all went home to set up our home offices, we either bought a new monitor or a printer or PC. So very quickly our personal electronics customers came back and came back very strong if you remember. The other markets began to follow, but automotive was the last to respond. And people early in the pandemic weren\u2019t shopping for cars, they weren\u2019t going out of the house. So they had that issue. And as manufacturers tried to reopen, they had more issues with COVID protocols and working to bring their plans back online. So it\u2019s not too surprising that there as an asynchronously came out. It\u2019s asynchronously going down. So \u2013 but all these markets we believe over the long term will behave the same. And at some point we believe that we will see a correction in automotive. It may not, but we don\u2019t \u2013 we just don\u2019t know. And we\u2019ll continue to ship product to customer demand. It\u2019s obviously very strong. There\u2019s lots of reasons why besides us gaining share, there\u2019s more content, there\u2019s mix and other factors inside of that. But clearly there\u2019s inventory built across all markets. It\u2019s inclusive of automotive. So do you have a follow-up? Ambrish Srivastava : I did. Just a quick one on the cash grant side of the CHIPS Act. And whatever I have read, it may be incorrect. But my recollection is that in Q1, Q2 timeframe, the government will delineate kind of the guidelines and what\u2019s your expectation of when that cash starts to come in? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So the CHIPS Act has both an ITC, investment tax credit and grants. So you\u2019re asking about the grants. We\u2019re still working through those details. We do not have an update to share right now though the applications open in February. So we are actively \u2013 we\u2019re going to actively seek funding on those in whatever \u2013 for whatever we could qualify. So we\u2019re going to submit our application in February. But right now, we don\u2019t have any information to share on that. The \u2013 all the accruals that we have taken so far, the 400 million that we have taken are all for the ITC, for the investment tax credit, 25% investment credit for U.S.-based manufacturing. Ambrish Srivastava : And the timing on that, Rafael, you will let us know about when that flows through the cash flow later on, right? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. In fact, let me take a second and kind of walk through how it flows through the financial. So you can actually look at our balance sheet on the Page 4 of our release. The other long-term assets that is up to 1.1 billion. You can see the increase year-on-year, that\u2019s the 400 \u2013 that\u2019s what a 400 million receivable is for that ITC. If we had not taken the ITC, that $400 million would have gone to property, plant and equipment. So you can see property, plant and equipment $6.9 billion that would have been $7.3 billion. So instead on a long-term asset, a receivable therefore it's not going to depreciate that $400 million doesn't appreciate because it's not part of PP&E, and eventually, we'll get the cash. Now to your question right now, based on our interpretation of the law, we're not going to get that cash until late 2024. And then every year, it will be like one-year in areas, right? You get a kind of one-year late, but that could change. Clearly, that's something that companies are advocating forward to get that cash early. But right now, we're not planning to get that until 2024. So again, that's how you see it on the balance sheet, lower PP&E. You see a receivable instead. Then because of lower PP&E, you have lower depreciation over the life of the asset [ph] and then the receivable because the receivable venture, you get the cash, so it goes from a receivable to the cash line, right? And then eventually, we return it to the owners of the company or use it for other \u2013 for the corporate core business. Hopefully, that answers your question. Ambrish Srivastava : Thank you very much. Dave Pahl : Yes. Maybe just quickly there 2024 timing is tied to when we file our taxes for 2023, right? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So yes, so not to add more confusion, but we get the cash through filing the taxes. However, this will not affect the tax rate because the accounting will put that, as I just described, through lower PP&E and you actually see the cash in the cash flow statement in the investing section. But the actual receiving of the cash happens at tax filing time in October or so of September of every year, and we just paid less taxes to that. But again, not to confuse you, the tax rate will not change. Ambrish Srivastava : It's an more-than [ph] accounting. Thank you, guys. Rafael Lizardi : Okay. Operator, we have time for one more caller, please. Operator : Thank you. And our final question for today will come from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen. Joshua Buchalter : Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. You mentioned customers getting inventory lower in the quarter. You're more direct than many of your peers that you have a better, I guess, view into end demand theoretically. And so \u2013 can you help us understand are we close to bottoming? Do you think we're getting to healthy levels? And were there particular end markets that saw more acute inventory correction in the short-term? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes. Joshua, maybe just quickly, obviously, when customers begin reducing inventory, its number one quarter phenomenon. It usually takes several quarters for that to happen. We won't have a sight and it obviously will also depend on what happens to their end demand, which we can't predict. And \u2013 but yes, we do believe that we get better visibility because we do have more direct relationships with customers overall, so you have a follow on? Joshua Buchalter : Yes. Thank you. You know, a lot of attention gets paid to your CapEx for obvious reasons, but R&D grew I think 7% or 8% in 2022 after being flat for a few years. And I think you guys fair or unfair get dinged for under-investing on the R&D lines. So I was wondering could you walk through some of your priorities for that spending and how should we think about R&D into 2023? Recognize it might be a question for next week. Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Sure. No, I\u2019m happy to address that. So first, these are long-term investments in nature. The R&D, clearly that\u2019s where we get the, continue to build on the broad portfolio. That\u2019s where we have process technology and that we get results over many, many years into the future. And we\u2019re going to protect those investments. But it\u2019s not just R&D, even in SG&A we have areas that are tied to capabilities. TI.com is the best example. That\u2019s another place where we\u2019re investing, and that\u2019s tied to a long-term top line growth of the company to be strengthening the reach of channels advantage, you could add CapEx to that picture. That\u2019s also obviously a long-term investment to strengthen our manufacturing and technology advantage. If you look at the, over the last four or five years, our OpEx, so R&D and SG&A, they\u2019ve been at a very steady $3.2 billion for like four or five years. This year for the first time, we picked that up to $3.4 billion. So we went up a little bit as we increased investments. And actually that was an impact on due to inflation, which we\u2019re not immune to that, you can expect that to continue increasing a little bit over the, in 2023 and over the next several years as we continue to increase investments. There\u2019s also the inflation component and but big picture, those are great long-term investments that will feel the growth for the company over the next 10 to 15 years. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Joshua. And thank you all for joining us. Again, we look forward to sharing with you our capital management update next Thursday, February 2nd, at 10 :00 AM Central Time. And a replay of this call will be available shortly on our website. Good evening. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Dave Pahl : Welcome to the Texas Instruments' First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide some insight into first quarter's revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the second quarter of 2023. Starting with a quick overview of the first quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.4 billion, a decrease of 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined, 14%, embedded processing grew 6% and our other segment declined 16% from the year ago quarter. As expected, our results reflect weaker demand in all end markets with the exception of automotive. As mentioned last quarter, a component of the weaker demand was inventory reductions by our customers, which we expect to continue in the second quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our first quarter revenue by market. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was about flat. The automotive market was up mid-single digits. Personal electronics declined about 30% as we continued to see broad based weakness. Next, communications equipment was down mid-teens and finally enterprise systems was down about 30%. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, first quarter revenue was $4.4 billion, down 11% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.9 billion, or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin decreased 480 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $929 million, up 14% from a year ago, and about as expected. On a trailing 12 month basis, operating expenses were $3.5 billion or 18% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.9 billion in the quarter, or 44% of revenue and was down 25% from a year ago quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $1.7 billion or $1.85 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.03 benefit for items that were not in our original guide. Let me now comment on our capital management results. Starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $7.7 billion on a trailing 12 month basis. Capital expenditures were $982 million in the quarter and $3.3 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis was $4.4 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $100 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.5 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. In the quarter, we issued $1.4 billion of debt. Total debt outstanding was $10.2 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.2%. Inventory dollars were up $531 million from the prior to $3.3 billion and days were 195, up 38 days sequentially. For the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.17 billion to $4.53 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.88. Lastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first one, I just wanted to dig into CapEx and depreciation. So you did CapEx of $982 million in the quarter. I just, first, can you just clarify that's the gross number without any of the tax credits? And I guess assuming that's true, both the CapEx and the depreciation number in the quarter are running well below the run rate there or the annualized number that you would give at the capital management CapEx should have been about $5 billion for the year. Depreciation maybe $1.5 million. So am I right in assuming that implies a fairly substantial ramp into the back half and end of the year for both those metrics, CapEx and depreciation? Rafael Lizardi : So thanks for the questions, Stacy. Good questions there. So it gives us a chance to clarify though. So first on CapEx, we're pleased with the progress that we've made both in 2022 but also year-to-date, first quarter of this year. Everything's in line with expectations as we shared at the call a couple of months ago, we expect CapEx to average $5 billion per year for the next four years. That's just an average. So some years will be lower, especially at the beginning and other years will be higher. But our expectation continues to be $5 billion per year. Those numbers, that $5 billion is gross. And the $982 million, the one close to $1 billion that you just quoted for the quarter, that's also gross. We are continuing to accrue for the CHIPS Act benefit. I can tell you about that in a follow-up question if you like. But the CapEx numbers have been and will continue to be gross numbers. On the second part of your question on depreciation. So we told you that at the capital management call that depreciation will increase to about $2.5 billion on or around 2025. We expect this year to be below that linear trend. Okay. And that's just the CapEx is coming in as expected, but it's a function of other things. Essentially when you place the equipment in service and when it starts depreciation, the assumptions that we had on that versus how exactly how it's playing out. You have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon : I do. Thanks. I'm going to let somebody else ask about the CHIPS Act accrual. I want to ask about inventories. So you're at almost 200 days of inventory. And I think the top end of your target was 190 and you said you'd be comfortable above that. And so we're kind of there. Are you done building inventory now, I guess, and if that's the case, what happens to fab loadings, I guess, as we go into the end of the year? I'm assuming you're running pretty full right now. Do those fab loadings need to come down, especially given the revenue trajectory and given inventories are sitting pretty close to 200 days? Rafael Lizardi : So let me start with reminding everybody our objective for inventory. And you can go back to our capital management call. I believe slide seven. You look at the objective there is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence. We have a range there. It's just meant to be informative and it's 132 greater than 200. I just wanted to clarify that versus the number that you mentioned. Now, the more important thing is, you know, I refer you to slide 13 in that deck. And anybody who hasn't seen that, you can download it from our website, go to slide 13. That shows you how we think about planning for the long-term. So through semiconductor, the ups and downs of the semiconductor cycle and that informs how we manage inventory, also informs how we are investing in CapEx. So we're thinking through the cycles over the long-term, but certainly inventory is one of those things that we take that trend into account. In the near term, we expect to have an upward bias on inventory as we prepare for long-term growth. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Stacy. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question. Vivek Arya : Thank you for the question. The first one is specific to industrial and automotive. If I heard you, Dave, I think you said industrial was flattish in Q1. I think it was down 10% in the last quarter. So seems like it's starting to flatten out. But I just wanted to check if that's the right conclusion. I think autos was up mid-single in both Q4 and I said and I thought you said in Q1 as well. So that also seems to be in the right direction. So the specific question is, as we look into Q2, how should we think about industrial and auto? Can they stay at least kind of flattish or do you think that they are also exposed to the macro weakness? Dave Pahl : Yeah. So first confirm that you heard correctly. Industrial market was about flat in the first quarter and automotive was up mid-single digits. And as you know our practice when we think about guidance by end market, we only provide color if there's something that we need to highlight to explain what's going on. You've seen us do that multiple times, whether it's end markets or it's regions or something specific that's going on. So as you said, at the midpoint of our guidance, revenue is flat. And so when we look strategically at both of those markets, we're very confident that they will continue to add semiconductor content per unit and be great growers for us. So you have a follow-on for that? Vivek Arya : Yeah. Dave, I actually wanted to stay on the same question because there is a perception that industrial and auto demand is kind of this last shoe to drop in semiconductors. And when I look at what your competitors, right, peers are seeing in analog and microcontroller markets. They are noticing a level of stability and strength. And that's what I want to confirm with TI that are you seeing the same thing as you go into Q2? Because, yes, consumer is weak, right? Enterprise is weak. That is well known. But specifically auto and industrial. Do you think they are now trending in the right direction in Q2 or do you think that you are in front of some weakness and inventory adjustment in those markets also? Dave Pahl : Yeah. And again we're not trying to provide guidance by specific markets. The overall outlook is roughly flat into second quarter. If we had something specific to call out, we would. And I think our approach to building closer relationships with customers, what we're doing in our channels, our product portfolio continues to strengthen. The capacity that we add are all things that continue to put us in a great position to service customers and service them well over time. But yeah so we're just not going to go into specifics of each market in the second quarter. So thanks for those questions. And we'll go on to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Dave, I guess I wanted to ask sort of where you think you are in the cycle because you have less exposure than many of your peers. So in theory, you should be farther along the inventory correction and you're more connected and real time to demand. So when you sort of look at your customer inventory levels, where do you think we are? Do you think that we're sort of in the late innings of the correction for you because you are a bit more connected to demand in real time? Dave Pahl : Yeah, I think, Tim, as you know, this is the first time that our markets, not only for us, but the industry have behaved differently as we've gone into this cycle. So if you look at personal electronics, we began seeing weakness in personal electronics back second quarter a year ago, right? So we're now into our fourth quarter of weaker demand. The other markets with the exception of automotive began weakening the quarter before last. So we're a couple of quarters in on that. So and of course automotive has remained strong through last quarter. So you put all that together. I think it depends on which market you're looking at. If you're in PE, you're obviously closer to the bottom than you are to the top. So I think our practice, we don't try to predict where the bottom or the top is, really draws -- draw your attention back to slide 13 that we talked about. That longer term trend is what we're planning on and what we believe we can look at to inform our decisions. Do you have follow-on? Timothy Arcuri : I do, Dave, yeah. So I know the SI data can be noisy and you always say to look at things on kind of a TTM basis and if you sort of roll it back, it looks like your share has gone down in analog roughly 200 basis points versus where it peaked in the early parts of COVID. So as you sort of forensically go back and try to figure out what's happened, do you think that's entirely based on supply? So in other words, if you didn't have the shortages that you did, you think that you wouldn't have lost that share? I'm just kind of wondering, as you look back at the numbers, how you forensically try to explain that share loss relative to the industry data? Thanks. Dave Pahl : Yeah. And as we've talked about that's something we think you have to look at over time. If you go back to the prior year as with the pandemic started, you remember we made some decisions to continue to run our factories and build long-lived inventory. And those decisions served us very well. So as we went through each quarter, as customers really expedited across the board. We could respond to that and ship them product. And in the short term, that probably helped us with the numbers when you compare it against what the industry was doing. So as we go into the following year, of course, those are our tougher compares. But we have a lot of practices that I think are different than many of our peers. As an example, through that period, we've moved to more closer direct relationships with customers. We believe that's giving us much better insight. We can see their demand more clearly. We can see what they need both short term and long term much better. Also I'd say that as we were moving through a period where most of our customers are reducing their inventory to align with their needs, we have an employee things like long-term sales agreements or non-cancelable, non-reschedule contracts. So customers aren't taking product that they don't need. So that isn't share gains, it's just -- I think for us, we want to be as easy to do business with as we can. And those -- I think all those practices are setting us up well to continue to gain share. So thank you, Tim. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you very much. Rafael, I just want to make sure I got the depreciation answer right. Obviously, it has implications for gross margin. And the run rate -- should we assume the first quarter run rate because that is a very positive implication. And you said it would be lower than the linear, but how much lower, I think we were all modeling $1.5 billion is kind of the number that we had. What's the right way to think about that, please? Rafael Lizardi : We're not breaking down specifics on that. But if you were going to do it linearly, you would get to the $1.4 billion unchanged and then $500 million plus on top of that every year until you get to about $2.5 billion in 2025. So it's going to run lower than that, yes, this year, and we'll give you an update the next capital management on subsequent years. Ambrish Srivastava : Got it. Got it. Just a clarification and not a follow-up. So if you look at gross margin last year versus this year, the three factors at least. I just want to make sure I'm doing it right is the flow-through and the fall-through that you talk about. And then the offsets would be LFAB is now going from restructuring into COGS and then apples-to-apples add a higher depreciation. Is that the right way? Am I thinking about the right three parts? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Those are the right three parts. And of course, this is over the long-term. Any one quarter, things -- there are many moving pieces, for example, mix always a place a factor, you have more auto and industrial that's different than personal electronics, right? But at a high level, over a long enough period, yes, those are the trends that the factors you should take into account when modeling this. Ambrish Srivastava : Got it. Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Thank you, Ambrish. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I want to follow up Ambrish's and talk about gross margin, but on a sequential basis, the gross margin held in better than I expected. It did go down sequentially, but not even as much as it would have if you just took the LFAB expense out of OpEx and put it into COGS. So were there any unique offsets to that? And probably more importantly, any unique offsets we need to consider as we think going forward? And I know, Rafael, you don't guide to gross margin specifically. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. No. I would tell you, it was similar to Ambrish's question, high level, think of the model we've given you is 70% to 75% fall-through. But that in any one quarter, even if it's on a year-on-year basis, but especially sequentially on relatively small changes in revenue, that's not going to work very precisely, right? So but over a long enough time, that works well. As we just talked about, you had the depreciation. And then in this particular quarter, you have to adjust for the cost that were in restructuring that were for Lehi that now go to primarily to cost of revenue. Now there are other factors that are going to play, for example, and I mentioned it to Ambrish a second ago, but mix is a factor. So you get a quarter with a lot more industrial automotive and less personal electronics, that plays into it. And the final one, depreciation doesn't necessarily immediately flow through the P&L because it needs to be matched to inventory. So that generally flows through inventory first and then so that sometimes delays the impact of -- the true impact of depreciation to the gross margin. But clearly, depreciation, as I mentioned earlier, it is increasing, so it's coming. So over a long enough time, multiple quarters, certain years, you need to factor it as we have talked about, right, the fall-through and the increase in depreciation. Dave Pahl : Do you have follow-up, Ross? Ross Seymore : Yeah, I do. I'll just pivot to round up that CHIPS Act question from earlier. Rafael, could you give us an update on what the cumulative accruals are for that? And probably equally importantly, when does that likely flow through the income statement? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So stepping back, CHIPS Act has an investment tax credit, ITC, and a grant. There's two components that have the potential to benefit us. If you go to our capital management document, we talked about those, and we said we are planning on the benefits from the ITC, and we're accruing those benefits. On the grant, we're not because the grants are highly discretionary. It's up to the Department of Commerce. So on those -- we're not counting on those, but we're applying to those grants, and we're in the process of submitting those applications and we're asking for everything we can get there. But right now counting on nothing. Now let me just focus on the ITC, which is the one that we are booking on the balance sheet. This last quarter, we accrued another $200 million benefit. So that's on top of the roughly $400 million last year. So now we have a total benefit that we have accrued of $600 million. That number will continue increasing for the rest of the year, and that's a 25% of qualifying assets in the United States. So we'll continue to increase that number over the year. And then what happens is we benefit in a couple of ways. One, the P&L that accrual comes out of the PP&E, property plant equipment basis. So now you have a lower basis to depreciate. So their depreciation is going to be lower going forward. We're already getting a small benefit of that this year, but it's in a couple of million dollars, but that will grow over time as those -- that equipment goes into -- is placed in service and now they appreciate at a lower rate. More importantly, the cash benefit associated with that will get the following year. So anything that we accrue this year and -- in '22 and is placed in service in 2023, we will get that cash at the end of 2024, okay? And we're -- that's what we're planning on. I think that answers your question fairly well. Okay. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Ross. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Danely : Hey, thanks, guys. Just some color on the inventory correction you're seeing out there. So do you think that we're through the worst of it? Maybe talk about where it's, I guess, lower or where it's higher? Do you think that it's getting better at this point or getting worse? Or can we not tell? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. I think Chris is one of the previous questions, somewhat similar, right? I think you have to look at it by market. Certainly, in personal electronics, being in the fourth quarter of the weakness would indicate you're probably closer to the bottom. There's no guarantee of that, but you're probably closer than in other markets, right? So that just isn't something that we try to predict. And what we do use to kind of guide how we think about things and where we make investments is that grey line on the chart that we've talked about. That's really what's important is being ready for the longer-term growth. And that's where our focus is. Do you have a follow-on? Christopher Danely : Yes. Can you just talk about the linearity of bookings during the quarter and how your backlog looks now versus, I guess, three months ago? And what does that imply for the second half of the year? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So our linearity was stronger in the last month of the quarter. And in backlog, I would say, as you know, we've got sales flowing through ti.com. We've got sales that are on consignment where we get direct feeds and we don't actually carry a backlog. So we just don't put a lot of emphasis on the backlog. Overall, I think compared to many of our peers. But we've got really good visibility because of our close relationships with customers. The fact that we're carrying, we're owning and controlling that inventory more directly. And so actually we've got -- we believe that gives us really great visibility on demand. So thank you, Chris. We'll go to next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Moore : Great. Thank you, guys. I know you were pretty early to signal some of the headwinds that came in China from the COVID lockdowns. What are you seeing now as the economies re-emerge? Are you starting to see that as potential strength going into the rest of the year? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, Joe, I would say that we continue to believe the best way to look at our revenue and the changes in revenue is more easily understood by looking at end markets, but there wasn't any significant change that we saw inside of China this last quarter. Do you have a follow-on? Joseph Moore : Sure. And then the down 30% in personal electronics and in enterprise both. Does that reflect any kind of share shift as -- I know that you do have people multi-sourcing more in areas like that in phones and PCs and servers and whatnot. Are you seeing that as any kind of a headwind? Or do you think that's just what the market was down in the first quarter? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. I think that as we've talked about before, sure, doesn't move quickly. We're in a position as we're building inventory to support higher demand if it was to materialize. So again we think that's mostly reflective of what's going on in the market. I think that's consistent with what you see from customers and other data that you can see that's out there. Thank you, Joe. And I believe we've got time for one more caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. C.J. Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify and confirm some of the statements from earlier. So your gross margins came a little better than what we thought for March. And so just curious, are you still on track for that $1.5 billion depreciation for the year? And were there any changes in kind of the timing of installation of equipment? Are you still seeing kind of a tight supply there? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So let me address that. First, CapEx. We're very pleased with our CapEx has come in. We did about $1 billion in the quarter. We talked a couple of months ago that we expect about $5 billion per year for the next four years, that's an average. So some years will be less, some years will be more. So $1 billion per quarter. That's obviously a $4 billion run rate for the year. So somewhere between $4 billion and $5 billion for this year would be about right on the CapEx. And that's coming in just as expected. Depreciation, we -- what we talked about a couple of months ago at the call was we expect it to increase to $2.5 billion at some point in the future in 2025 on or about 2025. We -- but this year, we expect that trend to be below linear. So instead of $500 million increase per year from the starting point of '22, it will be less than that in 2023. I think I'm bridge at the specific number on that. We're not disclosing that at this point, but I would just tell you look at -- we just did $265 million for the quarter. So you can do your own math of -- that was $249 million in the previous quarter. So you can -- you can think of that and come up with a decent approximation of where that may end up, and we'll give you more details, obviously, in subsequent quarters. Do you have a follow-up? C.J. Muse: Yes, please, a longer-term question. One of the overriding themes for the last couple of quarters on the semi-equipment side is the vast spending by lagging edge domestic China with an obvious focus kind of on the 90-nanometer plus. But actually I shouldn't discount the 28-nanometer plus part of the world. So as you think about regionalization and as you think about perhaps a rising kind of competitor in the China landscape looking out over the next five-plus years, how are you thinking about the pros and cons and how you'll compete kind of in that environment? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes, C.J., thanks for that question. I'd say that when you look at our products and markets, we've got 4 competitive advantages that we continue to invest in, I think that make us stronger and different than our competitors. And we've talked about them before, right? The first is the manufacturing and technology owning and controlling those assets we think will be growing important to where they are in the world. Also, we believe, will be a benefit to us as well. Second is the broad -- our broad product portfolio. So competitors that we have around the world, especially in China, usually only compete with us in a very, very narrow slice of our product portfolio. That said, we've competed with those companies, in some cases, for a couple of decades now. So competition there isn't new. And so they're good competitors. We can learn from them. We're not dismissive of them, and we close -- we very closely track and I believe the number somewhere around 75 different competitors around the world that we'll compete with. The third competitive advantage is the reach of our market channels. And especially when you look at some of the smaller competitors in China, they just don't have the reach. They don't have the breadth of portfolio that attracts customers for engagement and that just gives us better insight. And then the last is diversity and longevity. So there's not one market or technology that we're dependent on to provide market share lift. Now we'll be dependent on all of them. And sometimes in the short-term, that may favor one competitor versus another. But longer term, as we compete broadly in all the markets, we think that will translate into long-term and sticky share gains. So overall, we're pleased and excited about where we are from a position standpoint, whether we're looking at our traditional competitors here in the U.S. for Europe and as well as those in China. So thank you very much. And I'll turn it over to Rafael to wrap this up. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Thanks, Dave. Let me wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would one as our neighbour. When we're successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : And this concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Dave Pahl : Welcome to the Texas Instruments' Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the third quarter of 2023. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.5 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially and a decrease of 13% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 18%, Embedded Processing grew 9%, and our other segment declined 10% from the year ago quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by market. During the quarter, we experienced continued weakness across all markets except Automotive. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. First, the Industrial market was about flat. Next, the automotive market was up low-single digits. Personal Electronics was up low-single digits after several quarters of sequential declines. And next, communications equipment was down mid-teens, and finally, Enterprise Systems was down mid-single digits. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, second quarter revenue was $4.5 billion, down 13% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.9 billion or 64% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, increased capital expenditures, and the transition of LFAB-related charges to cost of revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 540 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $938 million, up 12% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12 months basis, operating expenses were $3.6 billion or 19% of revenue. Operating profit was $2 billion in the quarter or 44% of revenue and was down 28% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.7 billion or $1.87 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in the quarter and $7.4 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $3.2 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $80 million of our own stock. In total, we have returned $6.5 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we repaid $500 million of debt and issued $1.6 billion of debt. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory dollars were up $441 million from the prior quarter to $3.7 billion and days were 207, up 12 days sequentially. For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.36 billion to $4.74 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.92. Lastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are Manufacturing and Technology, a broad product portfolio reach of our channels, and diverse and long-live positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocations and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I had a high level question which is when I compare TI's sales growth right down almost 13%, 14% in the near-term down double-digit versus peers, it's significantly below, and when I look at your trailing 12-month free cash flow of sub-17%, if my model is right that is the lowest since 2010. But what point will TI say that something needs to change in the strategy to help close the gap on the growth side and to help free cash flow margins get back to the trend line? So I understand that obviously you're not optimizing the model for just one year, but now we have seen just consistent decline in free cash flow per share, which is your preferred metric. So at what point should we start to see free cash flow get back to historical trends? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. So, thanks, Vivek. Let me start, and Dave, if you want to chime in. But big picture step back to what we told you during capital management and the investments that we're making are long-term in nature as you alluded to in your question. And we are going to enable revenue growth for the company for the next 10 to 15 years. Okay. So that's how we're thinking about it. And that's why we're making this investment on CapEx, in particular, about $5 billion per year for the next four years, and we are committed to those investments. We're excited to making those investments regardless of the short-term fluctuations of revenue and of course lower revenue means lower operating cash, which now with the CapEx, that's why you're seeing on the free cash flow is not unexpected. Dave Pahl : Yeah, and maybe I'll just add that Vivek, as you know, and had followed us for some time. One of our competitive advantages is manufacturing and technology. So these CapEx investments really are strengthening that advantage over time. It's fairly obvious that those investments will allow us to produce products at significantly lower cost when -- to service demand and controlling those assets in today's world is increasingly important. So customers can see the investments that we're making. Not only with that, the other systems that we've got to make it easier to do business with us. Combined with the inventory we're putting in place to support their growth. And customer reactions is extremely positive to that. So, we believe these will be great investments for all of us long-term. You've a follow on? Vivek Arya : Yeah, thank you. I guess maybe to say, ask the same question, but in a different way, right? And with respect, I mean, TI had the same strategy two or three years ago also, but we saw sales grow worse than peers last year and sales are again growing worse than peers this year, so it's not one quarter or two quarter phenomena, sales have been undergrowing your peer growth for almost two years now and CapEx is growing while sales are declining. So that's why I'm questioning whether the strategy is still right whether the results are actually justifying the strategy. Dave Pahl : Yeah. I'll start, Rafael, if you want to add. Again, we've talked about is share doesn't move quickly inside of our markets. I think that depending on the peer you're comparing to, oftentimes the market exposure can explain a good portion of it. There's other factors like how much distribution is someone using. As you know, we've transitioned from mostly using distribution to mostly having revenue come direct. So there is inventory that needed to be burned out of the channel as we made that transition. So there's multiple factors. I think going forward, our confidence in being able to continue to gain share is extremely high. Customer reaction to the capacity that they know they need to have wanting to know that they've got capacity runway not from someone's manufacturing supplier, but directly from someone that makes their products is really resonates with customers. Okay, thank you. We'll go to the next caller, please. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question. My first one is on your Q3 guidance. You're guiding revenue up 1% sequentially. Dave, you called out automotive as the one end-market that continues to be healthy. But anything to point out or any stand-outs as you think about the sequential trajectory from Q2 to Q3 or is it a continuation of what you saw in Q2? Dave Pahl : Yeah, I'll just point out that this last quarter we saw weakness across the board in our markets with the exception of automotive like you've called out. And just to point out that continued asynchronous behavior. We had PE weakened back in second quarter a year ago and the other markets followed, but obviously, the exception of that with automotive continued to be strong and it's up over 20% year-on-year. So definitely very strong growth there. And as we look into the third quarter, we're not expecting to see any significant change in our end-markets compared to this last quarter. You have a follow on? Toshiya Hari : I do. Thanks. So inventory on your balance sheet was up I think 13% sequentially, days grew to 207. I know on your capital management call you revised up the upper range of your target to more than 200. I also appreciate, Dave, the transition from Disti to Direct. But at what point do you think you need to cut production or cut utilization rates and start to manage down the inventory? Are you still comfortable with where things are today? Dave Pahl : Yeah. No, thanks for the question, Toshiya. Yes, we are comfortable where we are. As a reminder, our objective for inventories to maintain high levels of customer service and minimize obsolescence. I would point you to slide 13 at our capital management call. That shows the semiconductor cycle over many years of about 30 some years and what that informs us on what could happen in the future and we're planning for the long-term growth through those cycles, not in any one quarter or even any one year. And of course inventory levels always depend on demand expectations and for the time being in the near term, they will likely have an upward bias. Toshiya Hari : Okay. So just to clarify, you're still running your fabs full at this point? Rafael Lizardi : Utilization this last quarter was lower than the previous quarter. That was largely a function of adding capacity. Toshiya Hari : Okay, thank you. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Toshiya. The next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So my first one is just to follow up on that. You said the inventories have an upward bias. So that means inventory like dollars and days, do you expect to increase again in Q3? Rafael Lizardi : Well, the days depends on revenue, of course, but on the dollars -- has an upward bias. So there's very likely that the dollars will go up in Q3. Of course -- and you know this is right, but inventory is on the balance sheet at one point in time, but it's meant to support the future growth and 200 days is about couple of quarters' worth of inventory in various stages of finish. Stacy Rasgon : How many quarters are they going to keep going up for though? Rafael Lizardi : That's going to depend on revenue expectations, beyond now and then, the decisions that we make on the factory, and we forecast one quarter at a time. Just know that our thinking, it's long term in nature, as I talked -- as I mentioned to Toshiya in the previous call. And we're managing through the cycles, right? So not what's going to happen in one quarter or even two quarters, what we think is going to happen over longer than that on inventory. On capacity, we're adding capacity that's going to support us for many years, right? So it's going to give us plenty of headroom. One more comment on inventory, just for those who maybe have not listened to us very often, but you know there's -- our inventory has very low obsolescence. The bulk of it is for counterparties that -- the inventory itself last year is, in fact, up to 10 years on the shelf, but the product life cycles are very long with our customers, and we have, in many cases, tens or dozens of customers that buy the product. So the risk of obsolescence is very low in the inventory. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Stacy. We'll go to the next caller, please. Stacy Rasgon : Oh. Was that my -- Dave Pahl : What was your second, yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Danely : Hey, thanks, guys. And by the way, thanks for having a nice, concise conference call. It's unique and semis, much appreciated. My first question is just on lead times and shortages. Given all the capacity you're adding in the inventory, can we pretty much say that TI lead times are the lowest, at least among peers and the shortages are all gone? Are we pretty much, I guess , back to normal. And I mean, are there any metrics that you could share with us sort of now versus three or six months ago on the improvement there? Dave Pahl : Yes. Chris, what I would -- how I would frame it today is we've got -- the vast majority of our products are available on ti.com for immediate shipment. And as Rafael talked about, whenever the upgerm does come, we'll have product available as well as capacity behind that to be able to support that demand. Now if a customer wants to give us an order at lead time, those lead times over the cycle haven't changed that much. So they can place that order or if they need inside of that, they can -- for the vast majority of the products, have it available. Now we do have hotspots. We'll probably always have a place where we have a demand and supply imbalance. But those hotspots are closing and closing pretty quickly. As Rafael talked about, we're bringing on capacity every quarter. So that just gives us more flexibility to be able to meet the customer demand. But it does vary beyond what we've got on hand. You have a follow-on? Christopher Danely : Yes, earlier in the call, and in a bunch of the calls, you keep talking about your advantages in manufacturing and given you have more internal manufacturing and more 300-millimeter than the competitors, are you, I guess, are you guys getting a little more aggressive on price? Are you able to price below the competition? Is this something that has happened recently? Some of your competitors have, I guess, complained about TI getting more aggressive in price recently. I just wanted your response to that. Dave Pahl : Yes. Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. Our pricing strategy hasn't changed. And of course, we regularly monitor with the pricing of all of our products, and we may maintain the goal to continue to gain share over time. But there's nothing unusual going on with pricing today. And I'll point out the fact that when we opened up our Fab 1, we had 75% of the tools needed inside of that factory, and there was handwringing back then if you remember that we were going to do something unnatural. And what we talked about was putting in place that capacity to support growth, and that's what it did. So thank you, Chris, we'll go to the next caller. Christopher Danely : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Harlan Sur : Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Up into the March quarter, the team had seen three consecutive quarters of increasing cancellations and push-outs, right sort of the typical sort of customer behavior in a weak demand environment. Did the team continue to see cancellations and pushout activity expanding in the June quarter? Or have you guys -- or have you or are you seeing signs of stabilization? Dave Pahl : Yes. The way I describe that is the cancellations remain at elevated levels. And we believe that customers are continuing to work down inventories to get that more in line with their demand. You have a follow-on? Harlan Sur : Yes. Thanks for that. So your embedded business continues to hold up very well, right? I think trailing 12 months, it's up 9% year-over-year versus your analog business, which is down 7%. I know part of it is due to the strategy, the refocusing of the MCU businesses over the past few years. More general purpose, catalog-focused, right? But it also seems to be reflecting this broader trend in the industry, if I look at the SIA data. If I look at you and your other MCU competitors, where -- industry MCU trends year-over-year are holding up much, much better versus the analog. I just wanted to get the team's perspective on why the large delta in performance analog versus embedded? Dave Pahl : Yes. Yes, thanks for that question, Harlan, and how you framed it. I would say at a top level, the changes that we have made to our product portfolio, the design in that and the customer response to those products as we've put them out in the marketplace continues to be very strong. Our confidence that that business will grow and gain market share over the long term is extremely high, based on that. And as we've talked about before, we're putting in place to be able to support that growth for embedded internally, and that is a position that we haven't been in quite some time. Near term, I would say, besides things stabilizing, we've experienced greater supply constraints over the last two years is embedded, has previously had to rely on foundries to supply that demand. And so those constraints are alleviating. And I think that that's just something that you see across the industry. So thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to the next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Blayne Curtis : Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to go back to the decision. I mean, I understand the inventory is not going to be obsolete, but it's eventually going to kind of steal from your future ability to scale gross margins. So I mean, at the current run rate, you're kind of building at like a $23 billion run rate, and it's going to only increase next year. So what's the harm in pulling it back a bit? I'm just trying to understand an interim here, just pulling back utilizations and not building so much inventory. Rafael Lizardi : In the big scheme of things, our goal here is to support revenue growth. It's not, frankly, to optimize short-term fluctuations in gross margins. Those are not irrelevant, of course, but it's just the focus is on supporting revenue growth in the short-term, midterm and long-term. And inventory supports short-term to midterm fluctuations, right, that we can mitigate -- we're having plenty of inventory. And the incremental cost of inventory is really low. As we talked about, on the obsolescence side, also on the variable cost nature of what goes into inventory. So it's just sort of just things that we keep in mind when -- in trying to make those decisions. Blayne Curtis : Yes. I just wanted to ask on gross margins. I mean, I know you don't give perfect color, but it seems like it's down at least 150 basis points sequentially. Maybe consumers are mixed. But I'm just kind of curious, is it just depreciation layering in? Or is there any other puts and takes on gross margin? Rafael Lizardi : So I assume you're talking about third quarter? So yes, our guidance, and as you pointed out, we only give top line and EPS. But our guidance is the best estimate that we have in our gross margins -- or I'm sorry, that guidance embeds -- the revenue is flat in that particular case, and it embeds the result in depreciation and other related costs from added capacity over time. On a year-on-year basis, I know you asked sequentially, but just a reminder, on a year-on-year basis -- keep in mind that last year, we had the Lehi acquisition fab cost in restructuring, and now it is in COR, in cost of revenue as of December of last year when you move. Dave Pahl : Yes. So yes, so year-on-year, the change in revenue, the increase in -- or moving of the cost from the restructuring into -- most of that into cost of revenue and as well as depreciation. So thank you, Blayne. We'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Joshua Buchalter : Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to follow up on the previous and ask about -- we understand that the depreciation flow through, that it is what it is. But can you maybe talk through some of the near to medium-term milestones when the 300-millimeter increased output, could start to benefit gross margin and sort of help offset the depreciation headwinds? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Just -- what I would tell you is depreciation, the way we depreciate equipment is over five years. Buildings is much longer, usually they average about 30 years or so. But consider that that equipment lasts a lot longer than five years, right? We have factories today that are running on 50 years-plus. And some of that has upgraded equipment. But -- but broadly speaking, that equipment lasts for decades, not the five years where we depreciate it. So it's probably an unfair comparison to try to put the 300 benefit next to the depreciation and expect an offset in the short-term. I would suggest you think of it from a cash standpoint. We're investing that CapEx. It's cash, forget about the depreciation, is -- CapEx is what we're investing. That's going to enable growth by adding that internal capacity, which, as Dave alluded to earlier, that is geopolitically dependable capacity. We're putting as many as four Fabs in Sherman, two in Richardson, two in Lehi in Utah. And then assembly test facilities in Asia, primarily Malaysia and Philippines, for example. So -- so that's going to put us in a really great position to grow the top line for a long time. And then what happens there is that yields a lot of operating cash for a company that then we can either redeploy or return to the owners of the company after those investments. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Josh? Joshua Buchalter : Yes, sure. Thank you. I recognize the language is similar last quarter regarding the end market commentary. But did anything change get any better or worse intra-quarter? And in particular, personal electronics grew, you've talked in the past about it sort of being a four-quarter cycle. Is it safe to say that that's sort of bottom now? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes. Again, I think that overall, we had continued to see that asynchronous behavior as we started back a year ago. And so that has continued. PE, again, it started -- we started to see weakness in Q2, so we've completed now -- it actually grew first to second. So we've got several quarters of decline. It was up slightly sequentially. And again, we're not expecting much change in our end markets as we look forward. So, okay, thank you. And let's go to our last caller, please. Operator : Our last caller comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Chris Caso : Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess just following up on the last few questions. Perhaps you could differentiate a little bit about where you think your customers are still burning through inventory as compared to end demand. And as you noted, the PE segment started to see weakness earlier. We heard from some others that it's no longer an inventory issue. It's more of a demand issue. Perhaps you could talk to that for some of your other end markets? And where we could see incremental weakness of customers still need to bring down our inventory further. Dave Pahl : Sure. Yes, Chris, I think if you look across the end markets broadly, you could say that all of them showed weakness and reflective of customers reducing inventories, with the exception of automotive. And even inside of that, of course, if you look at industrial, it's not -- all the sectors aren't identical, meaning you've had strength in aerospace, grid infrastructure, in other sectors like that. So -- and PE is the same way, not all of the sectors were as weak or as strong as others. So -- but broadly, you could say it was across each of those markets. Do you have a follow-on? Chris Caso : I do. Thanks. And maybe as a follow-on I'll hit on the segment that has remained strong, auto. And when this downturn began, I believe your commentary was that auto was -- had remained stable then. You thought that eventually it would come to auto just because it always has in the past. So far, it hasn't. I think it surprised a lot of us, the resilience on that. Has your view changed about the resilience of the auto market? Do you still expect that that has to correct at some point? And if not, why do you think it's different? Dave Pahl : Yes. So it wouldn't surprise us if it corrected. I don't think anyone can declare certainty on those types of things in the future. But I think that customers will build inventory. I've got 37 years of experience in the industry now, and that's the way the markets have behaved in the past. So that's generally a good guide in the future, but I think you can't pound the table and make absolutes, but certainly wouldn't be surprised if that were the case. So with that, we'll hand it over to Rafael to wrap this up. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Dave. Let me wrap up by emphasizing what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers, and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objectives, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : And this concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates : First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into third quarter revenue results, with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management, as well as share the guidance for our fourth quarter 2023. Starting with a quick overview of the third quarter : Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.5 billion, flat sequentially and a decrease of 14% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 16%, Embedded Processing grew 8%, and our Other segment declined 32% from the year-ago quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by market. During the quarter, automotive growth continued and industrial weakness broadened. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance, as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down mid-single digits, with weakness broadening across nearly all sectors. The automotive market continued to grow and was up mid-single digits. Personal electronics was up about 20% off of a low base. And next, communications equipment was down upper teens. And finally, enterprise systems grew upper-single digits. Given where the market is right now, it is a good time to remind everyone of our plan and areas of strategic investment. First, our confidence in the secular growth of semiconductor content per system, especially in industrial and automotive, remains high, and we are well positioned in these markets. Second, our long-term 300 millimeter manufacturing roadmap provides our customers with geopolitically dependable capacity. To support these buildouts and enable future growth, we continue to expect associated capital expenditures to be about $5 billion per year through 2026. In addition, we made good progress on our inventory replenishment, consistent with our long-term objectives to support growth and provide high levels of customer service. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Thanks Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Third quarter revenue was $4.5 billion, down 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion, or 62% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and, to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion and reduced factory loadings. As a reminder, LFAB-related charges transitioned to cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit margin decreased 690 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $923 million, up 7% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion, or 20% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.9 billion in the quarter, or 42% of revenue, and was down 29% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $1.7 billion, or $1.85 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.5 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $6.5 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in the quarter and $4.9 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.6 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $50 million of our stock. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 5%, marking our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. This action reflects our continued commitment to return free cash flow to our owners over time. In total, we have returned $5.6 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.9 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.9 billion, and days were 205, down two days sequentially. Inventory was up $179 million in the third quarter, less than half the increase versus the prior quarter, as we near our desired inventory levels. Therefore, we began to lower factory starts in the third quarter, which results in additional charges to the income statement. This impact is comprehended in our outlook. For the fourth quarter we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.93 billion to $4.27 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.57 as we continue to operate in a weak environment. Lastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. As you are looking at your models for 2024, based on current tax law, we would expect our effective tax rate to remain about what it is in 2023. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I did want to ask about gross margins. So I mean depending on what I assume for OpEx next quarter, I'm getting something like 250 basis points of compression maybe more. I know you talked a little bit about how some of that is the impact of utilization. Can you give us some feeling for, I guess, like the magnitude of the different drivers' utilization, lower revenue depreciation, pricing, and how we ought to be thinking about that trajectory as we get into the next year? Is there more to go, I guess, is what I'm asking. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Thanks, Stacy. Let me try to help you with that. Of course, for the forecast, we give a range of revenue and a range of NPS, not the pieces. But let me go through some of what I said for third quarter, which applies for fourth quarter and beyond. So for third quarter, like I said in the preferred remarks, in third quarter gross profit decreased primarily due to revenue, so that\u2019s the first driver, then to a lesser extent higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion, namely depreciation is the main one there, and reduce the factory loadings and that's the underutilization component. Then as I also said in the prepared remarks, inventory, which is the other side of the coin, as we near desired levels of inventory we will begin lowering factory starts in the third quarter. So there was an impact in third quarter due to that on the income statement. There will be a bigger impact in fourth quarter due to that. Beyond that, we're not forecasting, but of course that will depend on revenue expectations well into next year. Do you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon : I do. Thanks. So you gave us a little color on the end market behavior in Q3. Can you give us some thoughts on, at least even qualitatively, what to expect by end market into Q4? And particularly for auto, it sounds like auto in Q3 was so strong. Do you still see that strength continuing in the Q4 in the year end? Dave Pahl : Yes, Stacy, I'll take that. When you look at the guidance, it would suggest and we believe that we continue to operate in a weak environment in general. And if there was something significant that was changing from one quarter to the next as our typical practice, we highlight that and we just don't have anything to specifically call out for -- into fourth quarter. So thanks and we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Dave, I also had a question on autos. It sounds like it's holding in there despite this broadening strike. And I guess the question is, are more of your customers on consignment in that business or is the split in autos about the same as that, two-third, one-third versus the rest of the company? And I ask because I'm wondering sort of what you're seeing on the Disti side that you would sell into autos. Do you see bookings at least, weakening that would be more consistent with what we're seeing in terms of this strike and some of the weak macro numbers that we see? Dave Pahl : Sure. Yes. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, it was up, auto was up mid-single digits sequentially and it was up 20% when you look year-on-year. So obviously that growth had continued. In general, I would say that a market like automotive and personal electronics will have larger customers. Those larger customers tend to be biased to more consignment. So we would have that probably more in automotive than if I contrast it to a market perhaps like industrial. But overall, as you know, we've moved to having closer direct relationships with customers, which would include the customers that we have in automotive. And I think we service pretty close to 1,000 or so different automotive OEMs, so there is quite a bit of broadness in who we serve there. You have a follow on, Tim? Timothy Arcuri : I do, Dave. Yes. So what would it take to -- for you to think about cutting CapEx? And I ask because the plan was put into place when revenue was quite a bit higher than where it is today. Is there kind of a line in the sand for revenue where you would reconsider the plan? I know you've actually increased the plan. Well, revenues continue to weaken, but is there some like tree around, is there some -- if it weakens to this point, you would consider cutting CapEx. Just wondering any comments there. Thanks. Dave Pahl : Yes, let me comment on that. We're very pleased with the progress on our manufacturing expansion. They will provide geopolitically dependable capacity to support customer growth for the coming decade. And as you know, semiconductor content continues to increase. And to provide us the ability to grow at that 10% growth rate that we talked about at the last capital management call, if the market requires that, we'll continue to make those investments. So we continue to expect $5 billion of CapEx per year in 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026. So you should count on that. Let me also give everyone, as a reminder, these CapEx numbers are gross, meaning they do not include benefits from the ITC or grants from the CHIPs Act. So we're actively working through the grant application process with the CHIPS program office, which we believe will be meaningful to our manufacturing operations in Texas and Utah and will help support semiconductor growth for decades to come. And funding from the CHIPS Act grants was comprehended in our decision making for these investments. Timothy Arcuri : Great. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Tim. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Thanks for asking a question. In the third quarter I think it was the first time in a few years that you guys just came in at the midpoint of your guidance. Usually you beat it by 2%, 3%, 4%, something like that. So I guess my question is, anything strange in the linearity in the quarter, either by end market, just aggregate bookings, any color on that you could provide? Dave Pahl : Nothing strange. Ross, I'd say that the revenue built as we went through the quarter. And I'd say just in general, it's reflective of a weak environment that we're operating in, which is obvious from the guidance that we're giving. Do you have a follow on? Ross Seymore : I do. On the end market side of things, you said automotive was up about 20% year-over-year. I know oftentimes you go between giving sequentials or year-over-years, but could you give us year-over-years by the end markets, please? Dave Pahl : Certainly, certainly, yes. So industrial market was down mid-teens. I mentioned automotive was up about 20%. Personal electronics was down about 30%. Comms equipment was down about 50%. And enterprise system was down about 40%. So I think consistent with that weaker environment that we talked about. So thank you, Ross. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you guys could elaborate a little bit on the pricing environment. I think many of us have been picking up evidence of the pricing environment, particularly in Asia, intensifying over the past couple of months or a couple of quarters. You don't really give pricing as a reason for gross margins to be down sequentially and year-over-year, but what kind of role is pricing playing? Has your strategy changed at all, whether it be on the analog side or MCU side? Dave Pahl : Yes, so thanks for that question. Always helpful to be able to clarify that. First, I'll just start with pricing doesn't move quickly in our markets, nor is it a primary reason that customers choose our products. So we're typically agreeing to pricing that's out six months or on an annual basis for the following year. And so, we're continuing to move through that. Our pricing strategy, as we mentioned before, hasn't changed. So we're regularly monitoring what's going on with pricing. We always have a goal to remain competitive. And certainly a supply and demand has come into balance, or more closer to balance. We've said for some time that we would expect that pricing to behave like it has over the last couple of decades, meaning, low single digit decline. So as we move out in time, that's what we're beginning to see. So really no changes other than going back to what we've seen over the last couple of decades. You have a follow on? Dave Pahl : Yes, I do. Thanks, Dave. So I guess over the past 12 months, OpEx is up about 10%. Revenue is down about 10%. So as we think about calendar 2024, I was hoping you could give us a hint as to how to think about OpEx. And Dave, I think you used to give, or you had given multi-year guidance on depreciation. How should we -- to the extent there are any updates, how should we think about 2024 and 2025 depreciation? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. No, thanks for the question. I'll address both OpEx and depreciation. So on OpEx, we've held a steady hand on OpEx for many years and we'll continue to do so. So as an example, to illustrate the point, from 2017 to 2021 we ran at about $3.2 billion of OpEx. And then in 2022, it ticked off to $3.4 billion. And now we're running at about $3.7 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. So you can see the steady hand and just a bit of an increase over the last few years. And that's, as we have has a steady hand with our hires, new college hires, and as we make investments to continue to strengthen the company in the case of R&D, the broad portfolio in the case with sales and TI.com on the reach of our channels. Then on depreciation, so our CapEx expansions are unchanged. We talked about that, addressed it with previous callers. So $5 billion of CapEx per year for the next 2023 and three years beyond that, as we have been talking about. Now when it comes to depreciation, as time has passed, we have more clarity on what to expect on depreciation. So for fourth quarter, let me start fourth quarter of 2023, we expect depreciation to increase on a quarterly basis at about the same rate as what we have been seeing throughout 2023. So essentially, we're going to end the year just shy of $1.2 billion, maybe [11.90, 11.80, 11.70] (ph), somewhat in that range for the year. As an update for 2024, we expect depreciation to be between $1.5 and $1.8 billion, and for 2025 to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. Toshiya Hari : Very helpful. Thank you so much. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Toshiya. Now we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you. I had a question on factory loadings and inventory. So correct me if I'm wrong. I thought that thinking up until now has been we've got to be ready for the upturn and so, we're building inventory for that. And you have highlighted that over several quarters. Look, we're not -- we don't have a target, but you did raise the target in terms of how much inventory you want to carry. So this change, which I want to make sure I'm reading it right, that you're taking underutilization charge because you've reached a desired level of inventory. Is that a reflection that your expectation for the recovery is changing, i.e. you're expecting a slower ramp in revenues than what you perhaps were thinking a couple of quarters ago? Rafael Lizardi : Let me start and Dave if you want to chime in. But we have targets for where we want inventory levels to be and that goes by product and by state of finish of those products. So for example, of the 80,000 different products that we have, more than -- the vast majority of those are catalog, meaning, they sell to many, many customers. They last for a long, long time. So we can have so many years of inventory at the chip level or finished goods level, in many cases, at both levels, and that's based on our internal process to set those. So those are the -- and in aggregate, that's added up to $4 billion to $4.5 billion, and that's what we've been kind of guiding to and we've been talking about. But what really matters is what happens at the very specific level on a part-by-part number. So as we have near those levels, and you see our inventory level, our inventory levels have increased about $500 million per quarter for two quarters, and then this last quarter, $179 million. So clearly, there is a deceleration of that growth, and that's on purpose because as we near those levels, then we have slowed down the factory starts, that goes primarily with the fab, but also with the assembly test operations. And then we -- that slowdown will continue into fourth quarter. So they reversed the other side of slowing your factory loading is the underutilization charges. So as we near those levels, we are ready to be on the other side of this cycle for the upturn. And of course, it's not just inventory. Capacity is really the bigger driver, but you know what we've been doing on that now for a number of years and we're investing, but inventory really bridges that gap as an upturn happens until you get your factories really cranking at a higher level. Dave Pahl : Yes, and I'll just add and bring back to our capital management that we've been saying for, I think, over a decade now, our objective with inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, keep our lead time stable, keep product availability really high. So as we talked about earlier, ti.com, really, essentially all of our catalog products are available for immediate shipment. Lead times are stable. And so, we are prepared for that next upturn when it does come. You have a follow on, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava : Yes, quick one Dave. Just looking at the year-over-year in the fourth quarter, double-digit year-over-year decline, and I looked back many years. There have been other cycles where we've had multiple quarters of negative, but not that many times we have seen a double-digit kind of four, five quarters. I just wanted your perspective on what you folks are seeing this cycle versus and I know no cycle is the same, but just kind of give -- just help investors think about how to think about that double-digit four quarters and could be potentially longer year-over-year decline? Thank you. Dave Pahl : Sure. Yes. And I think we all know as being students of studying the cycles over the years. They're all the same and they're all different at the same time and they're unique. The one thing that is unique, of course, with the cycle is how the markets have behaved differently. We've seen bifurcation and really lined up very well with when markets recovered. So PE was the first to recover and was very strong early on. The other markets followed very shortly after that and Automotive was last. As you remember, many automotive manufacturers struggle to restart their factories and people weren't going to showrooms when we are in the midst of the pandemic. So really, as we've seen things begin to roll over, Personal Electronics was first. It was then followed by the other markets, and yet we still have automotive that's hanging in there. So I think that's the one thing that's unique. And I think as we've learned and studied the cycles, our product portfolio has changed as well over time. But the best time to be preparing for the upturn is before it shows up. So that's what we've been busy doing and we think we're in a great position to support the next upturn and to continue to gain share. So, thank you, Ambrish. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of the Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to automotive just to make sure that I understood what you said. Do your comments imply that you're seeing a largely seasonal environment in Q4 with no changes in terms of orders to traditional or EV customers? And if that is the case, if I understood it correctly, isn't that surprising given the macro headwinds that sector is facing? Dave Pahl : Vivek, your question was on third quarter or on fourth quarter? Vivek Arya : So what is being -- I think when you were asked before, you said that if there was anything abnormal, you would have mentioned it. So I assume that because you didn't mention it, that it is normal. Dave Pahl : Yes. So yes, what I said is that, if there was something that we needed to explain the outlook or unusual or however you want to describe it, we would do that. So I'm stopping at that point intentionally. And we'll finish up the quarter and report out what happens in the fourth quarter. Do you have a follow-up? Vivek Arya : Yes. On depreciation, what is driving the revision? Because your CapEx doesn't seem to be changing. And then kind of part B of that is, if I take that year-on-year delta, Rafael, I think it's about $400 million, $500 million or so incremental in 2024. So at the current revenue run rate, that's a 2 point to 3 point headwind to gross margin. I just wanted to make sure that I got those two points right. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So the -- for 2024, I said $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, and that is down from what you probably had before $2 billion. And for 2025, I said $2 billion to $2.5 billion, so that is down from $2.5 which we had said before. And the reason, as you pointed out, CapEx is not changing, so that's not the reason. It's just as time has said, we have more clarity on what to expect. So for example, depreciation on tools that doesn't start until the tool. It's not only received but installed and then qualified and that\u2019s when depreciation starts. So that doesn't happen immediately. So as we have learned more as to how that process works with all the number of tools that we're receiving for the various factories, then we're providing an update on depreciation. Thank you. Vivek Arya : And the gross margin headwind, is that -- did I have the calculation right? It's a 2 point to 3 point headwind on gross margins. Rafael Lizardi : Well, so we've given you the tools to calculate gross margin. So let me remind everybody what that is. First is revenue. So you pick the revenue that you believe is going to happen for the next several years. And it's working on a quarterly basis, but of course in any quarter there are a lot of puts and takes, but better to do it over longer horizons. So you start with revenue, then you fold that through at 70% to 75%, which by the way, that is reflective of the great, not only geopolitically dependable capacity that we're putting in place, but it is all that new fab capacity is 300 millimeters. So it has a structural cost advantage, not to mention that we're getting ITC and grants benefits that is installed in the United States. But -- so then you fold that through at 70% to 75%. Then you need to account for the added depreciation. So this year it's probably going to be close to $1.2 billion, and then next year it just gave you $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. So if you want to pick a point between that, then you get your added depreciation for 2024. And then at a high level, that's it. But of course, in any given quarter, even in any given year, but especially in any given quarter, you have to put some takes. And one of them that we're seeing right now is the underutilization. But that right now is headwind, but that can also be a tailwind when we're on the other side and we're increasing loadings and that -- what does that is that, then it comes back the other way, right? So -- but that's more of a tactical comment that happens in some quarters. Hopefully that answers your question. Vivek Arya : Yeah. Thank you. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Vivek. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Joe Moore : Yes, thank you. I wonder if you could walk us through the calculation on the underutilization charge. I mean, I think it seems like with over [indiscernible] of inventory, you would see the cost impact of that in six months, but you're pulling it forward. Can you just talk about how you determine how much to pull forward? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Well, so it's an accounting process and it's essentially when you're below what's considered normal utilization, that percent that you're below that -- and that is generally determined by wafer and the fab is wafer starts and out in the assembly test operation as your -- the number of units that you're producing and you divide that by the capacity that you can get, the maximum capacity. You establish a normal, which is where you normally expect to be. That could be 85%, 90%, 95%, depending on the situation. And whenever you're below that, then you take that percent that you're below and then you take those fixed costs and go straight to the P&L instead of going into inventory. So some of those costs that will come in fixed costs, some of them are depreciation, but it's not only depreciation. You have electricity, for example, is largely fixed. You use [indiscernible] whether that tool is running production or not as long as it's plugged in. So you take that into account. And then at the end of the day, you're not creating money when you do that, you just essentially put it on the balance sheet or the P&L. And in this case, it's going directly into the P&L as a linked quarter charge because that portion of the capacity is not producing. Now one more comment, that gives us tremendous operating leverage on the other side of that, right? Because think about fixed costs on the way down, they heard of it. But on the way up, they're fixed, right? So from a cash standpoint, on the way up, you don't spend any more and then you get just tremendous cash fall-throughs on the revenue, particularly when it's 300-millimeter capacity at very low cost. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Joe? Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. Separately, on the comm infrastructure business seemed quite soft, both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. I know that business isn't a focus for you guys, but can you talk about what's driving that weakness? Dave Pahl : Yes. And it -- last year was about 7% of our revenue, Joe. So we can find great opportunities in Comms Equipment. We continue to invest, we just don't think it has the secular growth that other markets like industrial, automotive fab. So we continue to make investments there. And as we've talked about that market over the years, it's one that just tends to be choppy. We believe that they're continuing to adjust their inventory levels as we work our way through this quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, it's down 50%. So that's a pretty significant drop. So yes -- so again, long term, we think it's a great market and we're positioned well there, but it will have these types of moves overall. Okay. thanks Joe. We will go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you, Dave. Thank you, Rafael. So you talked about operating in a weak environment. Could you also give us some color on bookings trends, maybe even the current run rate versus where you think consumption is? Just trying to understand, and this goes back to Ambrish's question about four consecutive quarters of double-digit declines. So yes, any color on bookings trends would be really helpful. Dave Pahl : Yes. So as I mentioned, I think as part of another question on revenue order linearity, there was nothing unusual inside of that. Secondly, we obviously, we're describing the environment as being weak. And we don't have a system that tells us, are we shipping above or below demand. The strongest signal that we get is orders from customers. Now as we talked about earlier comms, or a market like Personal Electronics was the first market to go into the downturn. We've had a couple of quarters of growth inside of that market. Now it's up off of a very weak base. But we are seeing that as a trend. If you compare that to the industrial market, we had seen that, let's say, let's call it, about half of the sectors begin to weaken a couple of quarters ago, it was really this quarter that we saw that, that weakness is broadening. So customers, we believe, inside of markets like that inside of markets like Comms equipment that we said they're adjusting their inventories as such. So again, that provides us the opportunity both strategically with building the capacity and more tactically, building, putting in place the inventory to be able to support the next upturn because it will certainly come. Do you have a follow-on? Tore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you, Dave. Very helpful. Follow-on for Rafael. Rafael, thank you for the depreciation numbers for the next few years. Do you also have an update us on the timing of the offsets to the depreciation, especially in relation to ITC and the CHIPS Act and anything new there? Rafael Lizardi : So nothing new, frankly. The ITC is the expectation is similar, which is about a 20% to 25% credit on everything that is spent on CapEx in the U.S. for fabs. So what we said back in February is that that's going to be roughly $4 billion of the $20 billion or so that for CapEx, the $5 billion more. So roughly about $4 billion of that we're going to get back on ITC about one year offset. Of that, we have already accrued $1.2 billion on the balance sheet. So you'll see that on our balance sheet on the long-term assets. A portion of that, we will get some time next year, probably by fourth quarter next year is when we expect to get that cash, so that's when the cash will start flowing in. As I mentioned in an earlier call, on an earlier question, we are actively applying for the grant. So that's going to be in addition to the ITC. We're not counting on that. We don't have any numbers on that because you have to apply, you have to wait until the Department of Commerce makes that decision. But we are -- we're planning on receiving the funding from the CHIPS Act grant was comprehended in our decision, and we firmly believe we are very well positioned to receive those funds, and we're a great candidate for that, and we believe there will be meaningful to manufacturing operations in Texas and Utah to support semiconductor growth and the objectives of the CHIPS program office. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Tore. Let's go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Thank you. Good afternoon. China headquartered shipments or about 20% of to the first half of this year. Does this geography has experienced the most significant decline. I think it was down like 33%, 35% year-over-year in the first half of this year. Much of your China business is focused on industrial. Is this geography continuing to contribute to the weakness here in Q4? And what other geographies are you seeing that is contributing to this broadening out of sort of the weak industrial trends? Dave Pahl : Yes. So let me -- I'll speak to what we saw in the third quarter. And just in general, including industrial in China continue to remain weak. So, I think if we're having this call a year ago or so, as China came out of COVID, I think most of us would have expected there to be a more significant rebound, which just hasn't materialized. So yes, I think when you look at on a regional basis compared with the year ago, the only region that was up was Japan. So the other regions were down. And so, again, just described that weakness as being very broad in nature. Do you have a follow-on, Harlan? Harlan Sur : Yes. Thank you. So your embedded business continues to hold up relatively well, right? Trailing 12 months, it's up 8% year-over-year. You've talked about the positive strategy changes in embedded. Last quarter, you also cited some constraints. I assume that those constraints have fully normalized. So do you anticipate embedded continuing to hold up? Or do you anticipate this segment starting to weaken from here with some of the capacity constraints potentially easing? Dave Pahl : Yes. As we talked about before, we had focused on changing the product strategy that we had inside of embedded. I'd say we're very pleased with the results that we have so far. Our first objective was to stabilize that business. And we continue to invest in it because we believe it has long-term growth potential and contribution to free cash flow. So we're very pleased with where we're going. I think more tactically, as we talked about last quarter, we saw that business does rely more heavily on foundry suppliers. We began to see those -- that capacity begin to free up for us. And I think that it was different because we had capacity in place to service analog, our own capacity there overall. So, yes. So again, we think that business long term is going to be a great driver for us in the future. So thank you. And I think we've got time for one more caller. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. William Stein : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave, can you remind us what's in the other segment besides calculators and perhaps why that end market was down so much more than the others? I know it's very seasonal from calculators, but there was a big drop year-over-year. Dave Pahl : Yes. So besides calculators, we have our DLP or Digital Processor Products that are in there. So those products are continuing to make their way through inventory correction overall. And calculators had a weaker back-to-school this season. Do you have a follow-on? William Stein : Yes, perhaps something that hasn't come up in a while, but lead times. We were dealing with this golden screw issue for a while where there were quite a number of parts or quite a big part of the, let's say, all the available SKUs that had very extended lead times with revenue down as much as it is. I'm guessing that, that's mostly resolved and lead times are like sort of stock to four weeks for most things at this point. But if you could level set me on that, the degree to which there are still extended lead times, that would be really helpful. Thank you. Dave Pahl : Sure. Yes. So and I may have mentioned this earlier, but almost all of our catalog products are available on ti.com for immediate shipment. And so, as we approach our desired level of inventory, we've got a product that is positioned both in finished goods as well as in wafer form to be able to restock that. Of course, lead times, therefore, are what I described normal levels and continue to be consistent. And there's probably no time that we don't -- with so many different products and so many different customers. We'll have hotspots, but they are very few and far between and our ability to close those is very -- we've got flexible manufacturing as most of our production is fungible. So with that, I'll ask Rafael to wrap up the call for us. Rafael Lizardi : All right. Let me wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously. At our core were engineers and technologies, the foundation of our company but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is a long-term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing and we will be a company that we are personally proud to be part of and would want as our neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Dave Pahl : Welcome to the Texas Instruments Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. I'd like to provide some information that's important for your calendars. Next week, on Thursday, February 1, at 10 a.m. Central Time, we'll have our Capital Management Call. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insight into our business and our approach to capital allocation as we prepare for the opportunity ahead. Moving on, today we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next I'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. I'll then provide an annual summary of revenue breakout by end market. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the first quarter of 2024. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue is $4.1 billion, a decrease of 10% sequentially and 13% from the same quarter a year ago. Analog revenue declined 12% year-over-year and embedded processing declined 10%. Our other segment declined 25% from the year-go-quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. Our results reflect increasing weakness in industrial and a sequential decline in automotive as customers work to reduce their inventory levels. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down mid-teens as we saw that increasing weakness. The automotive market was down mid-single-digits after 3.5 years of very strong growth. Personal electronics was about flat. And next, communications equipment was down low-single-digits. And lastly, enterprise systems grew low single digits. In addition, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market. As a percentage of revenue for 2023, industrial was 40%; automotive was 34%; personal electronics 15%; communications equipment 5%; enterprise systems 4%; and other was 2%. In 2023, industrial and automotive combined made up 74% of TI's revenue, up about 9 percentage points from 2022, and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technologies to make their end products more reliable, more affordable, and lower in power. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application, which will drive faster growth, compared to our other markets. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks Dave, and good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned fourth quarter revenue was $4.1 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.4 billion or 60% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansions, and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 650 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $898 million, up 4% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 21% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.5 billion in the quarter or 38% of revenue. Operating profit was down 30% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion or $1.49 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.03 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.1 billion in the quarter. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $65 million of our stock. We also increased our dividend per share by 5% in the fourth quarter, marking our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. In total, we have returned $4.9 billion in the past 12-months to owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4 billion, up $91 million from the prior quarter and days were 219, up 14 days sequentially. Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2023 cash flow from operations was $6.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $5.1 billion. Free cash flow for 2023 was $1.3 billion or 8% of revenue. Our free cash flow reflects the strength of our business model, as well as our decisions to invest in 300 millimeter manufacturing assets and Inventory to support our overall objective to maximize long-term free cash flow per share, which we believe is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.75 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $1.16. We now expect our 2024 effective tax rate to be about 13%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Toshiya Hari : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. My first question is on your Q1 outlook, I think at the midpoint you're guiding revenue down 12% or so which is you know clearly well below what we consider to be typical seasonality. Any end markets or regions or device types that you can call out that's driving that view? Or is it broad-based weakness across all applications? Dave Pahl : Yes, I'll take that, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. In fourth quarter, we did see weakness in industrial, increasing weakness there. We saw the sequential decline in automotive. And as the guide would suggest, we believe that we'll just continue to operate in a weak environment and one where customers are continuing to rebalance their inventories overall. So, but nothing specific to comment on. You have a follow-up? Toshiya Hari : I do, thanks Dave. Just on gross margins, I think you guys did a good job in explaining what's driving it. Still, I'm a little bit surprised with the year-over-year, kind of, drop through, if you will? Gross margin dollars essentially dropping as much as your revenue. I understand the underutilization, the increase in depreciation. But what are you seeing from a pricing perspective? Is it more pricing than volume that's driving the revenue decline and the decline in gross margins? Or if you can kind of speak to your strategy from a pricing perspective, what you're seeing in the marketplace? That would be helpful. Thank you. Dave Pahl : Yes, Toshiya and I'll remind everyone else, I know you know the industry well, but you know pricing just doesn't move quickly in our markets overall and nor is it the primary reason why a customer chooses our products. So and as we've mentioned before our pricing strategy hasn't changed and of course, we're always regularly monitoring the market and pricing our products appropriately. And as we've talked about now for I think a couple of quarters, as we expected supply and demand to come more in balance, that we would expect pricing to revert back to how it's behaved over the last 10 or 20 years. And over the last six months or so, that's what we've seen. So somewhat of a low-single-digit decline is what we're expecting out in time and wouldn't describe that as unusual. Thanks for the question. Toshiya Hari : Great. Thank you. Dave Pahl : We\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask about factory loadings. Dave, gross margin was down maybe 250 basis points. It's kind of implied to be down 250 basis points. Even if I strip out depreciation, it's down about 100 basis points for March. So it seems like utilization is coming down a bit. And CapEx also came in a little bit lower too for December. So the first question on that is, can you talk about loadings? Is March going to be the bottom in loadings and we should see inventory begin to come down also in March? And then I had a follow-up on that too. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, so, no, thanks for the question. So step back in third quarter, at the end of third quarter, we talked about this. As we have near our inventory levels, then we have adjusted our factory loadings accordingly. So in third quarter, we did some of that and that had an impact on gross margins on underutilization. Fourth quarter adjustment was bigger than third quarter. And now going into first quarter, we're taking that adjustment further. So the first quarter adjustment on underutilization will be bigger. But we continue to have an upward bias on inventory as we continue to build the right buffers for the right parts to be ready on the other side of the cycle. So, follow-up? Timothy Arcuri : I did, yes. So then on CapEx, can you talk about that? It was a little lower. It's running actually quite a bit below the $5 billion run right now. So are you actually cutting CapEx now since you're bringing down factory loading? Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : No, we're not. In fact, CapEx came in as expected $5.1 billion, and we've been talking about $5 billion per year. So it was right on target. And you should expect, and we expect, to continue running at about $5 billion per year through 2026 as we complete the investment plans that we've been talking about. Dave Pahl : Great. Thanks, Tim. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citibank. Please proceed with your question. Chris Danely : Hey, thanks guys. Just a follow-up on the utilization rates. So is the target, I guess, inventory level. Has that not changed for you guys? And so do you expect utilization rates to bottom in Q1? Or do you think you might have some more inventory adjustments going into Q2 for TI? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, no, thanks, Chris. So broadly speaking, our inventory targets have not changed over the last six, nine months through this cycle. So we still have some ways to go, clearly less than we did six months ago. But we still have some ways to go on that front. At one point, I talked about $4 billion to $4.5 billion worth of inventory. So that's in the ballpark, and we just finished just shy of $4 billion. But as far as when, underutilization bottoms, that's going to depend on revenue expectations. And at this point, we're only, as always, we only give one quarter at a time. So we'll see where we are 90-days from now and we'll tell you about that. Dave Pahl : Yes, maybe I'll just add that our target inventory is set really by device. It's -- we look at things like how many customers are buying the product, what the buying patterns look like, how long it takes us to manufacture the product. So it's really a bottoms up plan built on that very, very specifically. So that's what drives that target overall and we want to have inventory position to support growth over the long-term. This is a side comment. So, a follow-on, Chris? Chris Danely : Yes, thanks guys. I guess just a little bit of color on the end market commentary, thanks for that. On the industrial side, it sounds like most of the downside is due to excess inventory, not demand. I was hoping you could confirm that? And then with automotive weakening, is there any reason why automotive wouldn't fall under the same issues that the industrial end market/inventory would as well? Dave Pahl : Yes, so I'll start and Rafael if you want to add anything. I would say that the demand signals that we get from customers are orders that they place, whether that's either directly or through consignment feeds. So that's the data that we can see. We actually can't see their inventory levels. We can anecdotally, as we see a market like personal electronics is down 30%, 40%. We know handsets and PCs, that market hasn't gone down as much as that. So we know anecdotally that we're shipping below demand. So we believe that, that's what's going on in industrial. We have customers who have told us that they have built inventory and plan to correct that. So having a real clear picture of what their demand looks like and their channel inventories look like isn't something that we can see directly overall. So and the comment on automotive, we know that customers there did want to build inventory. And we believe that they're in a good position now, so it wasn't surprising that we saw a sequential decline there. So thanks Chris, we\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Tom O'Malley: Hey, and thanks for taking my question, guys. I just wanted to understand the linearity of the industrial and automotive declines? When you set out in the quarter, baked into your expectations, were you kind of looking at these two businesses, both a little bit better than they came in or was one a bit worse than the other versus your expectations? And then just in terms of the timing of the quarter, it looks like your finished goods inventory went up a bit more than your other buckets. And I just wanted to understand, is that just because later in the quarter customers were signaling some weaker trends or is there any reason behind the dynamic there? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Let me start with the second part of the question. And Dave, you want to take the first one? No, the second part, that's just a reflection of our ability to build those inventory buffers that we were talking about. And what you're seeing there is on the finished goods side. That's one, Dave alluded to earlier, that's one set of targets that we have. That's at the finished goods level. Remember, we have 100,000 different parts, and the vast majority of those are what we call catalog, which means they sell to many, many customers. So we want to build a certain finished good level for each one of those parts. But we're also building at the chip level. Think of you know a chip can go into two, three, 10 different finished goods so it works out well to have some chip level inventory operationally, but you also have want to have finished goods. So that's what you saw there. Dave Pahl : Yes and by end markets, Tom, our guidance, as you saw, where our revenues came in, we were, I think, less than 1% from the midpoint of the guidance range. So the business came in about as we expected and nothing unusual versus our expectation in industrial or automotive overall. So\u2026 do you have a follow-on for that? Rafael Lizardi : No it\u2019s two part question. Yes, that counts as good. Tom O'Malley: Yes. Rafael Lizardi : Okay. Tom O'Malley: All right. Thank you. We appreciate it. Thanks. Dave Pahl : Next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask about the product side, the analog versus embedded. Embedded had a significantly better year, dropping 3% versus the analog down 15%. I know there's very different end market exposures for those, but were there other competitive dynamics, pricing dynamics, strategic focus dynamics, anything else to explain the difference between the performance of those two segments? Dave Pahl : Yes, Ross, I think your instincts are spot on that the first lens to look at things is through the end markets and embedded has is heavied up in industrial and automotive, so revenues there were stronger for a longer period of time. The second consideration is that embedded relies on foundry wafer supply more heavily. Most of our analog businesses done internally. So there the constraints lasted longer and have now been resolved and are behind us, so that created some of the lag between there as well. So, and as you know, our CapEx plans and spend will have more of our wafers overall built internally, which is inclusive of embedded. You have a follow-on? Ross Seymore : Yes, I do and it's kind of a cyclical question. You guys are astute students of cyclicality of this whole industry. I think this is going to be including your guide the sixth quarter of negative year-over-year comps. Do you see anything that's TI specific, that's different this cycle, you know, pricing just got so good before, now it's a bigger headwind, you kind of addressed the pricing dynamic a little bit before, but what's making this duration so much longer and is any of it TI specific? Dave Pahl : Yes, Ross, you know, I think I'll make a comment and Rafael if you want to add anything. You know, what all cycles are the same and they're all different right as we've all studied them over time. What's clearly different this time is how the markets have behaved in the bifurcation. We saw personal electronics begin to weaken second quarter a year ago and automotive you know just we saw the sequential decline this last quarter. So in the other markets somewhere in between. So and then in addition I think that, you know, we've had lots of other noise that's inside of the system, whether that's been pricing, as you mentioned. We've had non-cancellable, non-rescheduled orders and other longer-term contracts that have required customers to take product that they don't need, whether companies are using distributors more heavily than others. So all of that adds noise into it. So I think we just need to let that noise wring itself out over the cycle. And what we're focused on, of course, is investing in our competitive advantages, getting stronger. We believe that we're in a great position to continue to gain share over the long-term. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, I just want to clarify for those who maybe new on the call, when Dave talked about non-cancellable, non-returnable, or that's not, we don't do that. Many of our competitors have done that. So that, in our view, distorts the market. That wasn't the case with us. And the second point, distributors, same thing. Our distributor footprint is much smaller than with many of our competitors. We're down to 25% or so for our revenue through distribution, so 75% direct, whereas many of our competitors are the opposite, so\u2026 Dave Pahl : Great clarification. Thank you, Ross. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Pleased to see you with your question. Joe Moore : Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the Chips Act, how that's kind of flowing through both the investment tax credit and then any thoughts you may have on timing of kind of grant issuances or things like that? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, I'm happy to talk about that. So first, let me address the ITC first and then I'll go to the grant. So the ITC investment tax credit 25% credit on CapEx or manufacturing in the United States. We have accrued to-date over the last year and a half or so $1.4 billion. We expect to get about $500 million of that later this year, probably in fourth quarter as far as the current law and regulations stipulate. And we'll get the rest further down the road, mostly the following year and then after that. And we'll continue to accrue that benefit, just again, 25% on anything we spend in the United States for manufacturing. That's the cash side and the balance sheet. On the P&L, we're already seeing the benefit as lower depreciation. That benefit tends to be small, has been small so far because for example, some of that is for buildings that haven't even started to depreciate, but it will build up over time on that front. So that's the ITC. The grants, we submitted our application for those in December. And at this point, we will wait to hear from the Department of Commerce and see what happens there. Dave Pahl : Is there a follow-on Joe? Joe Moore : Yes, I did. So I think, obviously that stuff will help the cash flow down the road, but your free cash flow is below the level of the dividend. Right now, I assume it's pretty important to keep paying the dividend. Where does that leave you in terms of share repurchases and other uses of cash? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, first, I would point you to our operating cash. Our business model is very strong and our operating cash flow is very strong and it supports our investment for growth through the cycle. So clearly with the levels of CapEx that we have right now, that hits the free cash flow. But big picture understand and look at the operating cash, even in a depressed environment with the revenue, depressed operating cash flow is very strong. We also have very strong balance sheet. And we just finished the year at $8.6 billion. You know, when it comes to repurchases, I would take you to our objectives on capital management for cash return, and our objective is to return all free cash flow via dividends and repurchases. Each one of those has different objectives on dividends and repurchases, but we have a really good track record over many years of doing both of those. Joe Moore : Great, thank you. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Joe. Go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Harlan Sur : Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Up through Q3 of last spring, the team had seen numerous consecutive quarters of increasing cancellations and push-offs, typical customer behavior in a weak demand environment. I assume, given your commentary, that the team continues to see cancellations, push-outs, activity expanding into the December quarter. You're almost a month into March. Are you still seeing cancellations and push-outs expanding or starting to maybe see some signs of stabilization? Dave Pahl : Yes Harlan, you know, as you would expect we have seen cancellations in the quarter and fourth quarter had remained elevated. I wouldn't describe them as increasing, but just at higher levels. You know, and we're still early inside of the quarter. I would say all of, you know, what's going on with cancellations and the backlog that we see is all comprehended in our guidance and in our outlook. Harlan Sur : Okay, Perfect. And then, yeah, from a geographical perspective, China headquarters shipment still about 20% of your sales through the October quarter of last year. This geography has experienced the most significant decline during this downturn. It's down about 33% year-to-date up through Q3 of last year, your total business was down 13%, right? Is this geography continuing to contribute to the weakness stepping into this year, or is the weakness more U.S. and European-based? Dave Pahl : Yes, I would say when you look regionally this quarter from a -- just from a dollar standpoint you've got sequentially all the regions were down with the exception of the rest of Asia. So nothing unusual with China going on specifically there overall. So again, when we look at our business, I think most of that is explained by the end markets and certainly, we hadn't seen a recovery inside of China that I think most of us were expecting. Harlan Sur : Okay. Thank you, Dave. Dave Pahl : Go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Joshua Buchalter : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask you about how you're thinking about OpEx given the extended softness. Any thoughts on getting more defensive with OpEx? Does the weakness last longer than expected? Or you grew OpEx 8% in 2023. Is that sort of the right level that you think you need to be investing in the business for the long-term growth? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, you know, big picture. We have a disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D and SG&A to the best opportunities. And we've held a steady hand throughout a number of years, pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, post-pandemic, where we managed OpEx very well during that time and didn't get ahead of our skis. So we will continue with that discipline process. Remember, of course, these investments, particularly industrial automotive, which is what we're biased in, are investments. They're very long-term in nature. You're not going to -- what you save now is going to would hurt your long-term revenue growth so we're not going to do that so we're going to maintain those investments for the long-term. Dave Pahl : A follow-on Josh. Joshua Buchalter : Yes, thank you. I guess I wanted to ask about your fixed cost leverage. I mean, you've been in the past, you've talked about I think 75% gross margin fall through on incremental revenue. Is that still the right metric we should be using given revenues a good amount lower and depreciation is larger? I'd just be curious to hear if anything in the mechanics of that math has changed. And basically when can the incremental 300 millimeter capacity start flowing through the gross margins and be margin accretive? Thank you. Rafael Lizardi : Yes, so the math is still the same. The fault-through issue used is 70% to 75% that is still a reasonable starting point. You then have to adjust for depreciation, as you alluded to, and our depreciation, I gave you an update on that 90-days ago, but I'll reinforce that in a second, but you have to adjust for that. And then there are always put some takes on any given quarter, like right now it's underutilization, but at some point that goes the other way. Throughout this time, as you pointed out, we will continue to benefit increasingly from 300 millimeter, more 300 millimeter wafers, which have a cost advantage. So, let me go back to the appreciation just to make sure everybody has the right number. It's the same as what I said 90 days ago. For 2024, expect $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion and for 2025, expect $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Josh. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question. CJ Muse : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, your revenue outlook for March basically gets us back to kind of pre-COVID first-half 2020 levels, yet at the same time your inventory is roughly double. And so curious, how are you thinking about kind of normalized inventory over time? And also, how are you thinking about coming out of the trough, what kind of a gross margin recovery will look like given where your inventory levels are today? Rafael Lizardi : So that's a multi-part question in many angles to that. What I would tell you, high level, we're very comfortable with our inventory level. Right now we're just shy of $4 billion as I said earlier on the call. We have continued upward bias for at least one more quarter, probably a couple quarters at least, an upward bias on that. But that is good inventory for catalog parts that sell to many customers that last a long time. So I feel really good about that. But we'll see how things play out on the other side of the cycle and depending on demand and different things. But I would expect to continue holding relatively high levels of inventory. We just in a different position than we were even three or four years ago in terms of how much of our revenue and our parts are in industrial automotive, in catalog type of parts that last a long time. So our strategy is such that it makes sense to have that inventory. Our order fulfillment processes have also improved. We have ti.com and different tools that we can leverage to go direct to market. We have a much higher percent of our revenue now 35% is direct. So all those factors play into having more inventory as a real leverage point that we can use to serve our customers even better. Dave Pahl : A follow-on CJ? CJ Muse : Thanks, Dave. A quick follow-up to a prior question. I know you can't share too much, but your application clearly in for the Chips Act. I guess we should hear results between now and the summer. I guess is there anything you can share on that front and perhaps how it's kind of impacting your thoughts on the capacity you're bringing online? Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, no, unfortunately, no, there's nothing we can share. It's really up to the Department of Commerce, we sent our application and we'll see where that goes. What I would say, just like I said before, is when we decided about a year ago to take our CapEx up from $3.5 billion per year to $5 billion per year, and this tremendous plan to build more fabs in the United States, we comprehended Chips grant in that decision. So that was part of our thinking there. But at this point, yes, that's all we can share on that front. Dave Pahl : All right. Thank you, CJ. And I think we've got time for one more caller, please. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Chris Caso : Yes, thank you. Guys, I just did, just trying to understand a little bit about why the customers may have reacted as they did. Because we know your lead times have normalized well in advance of the rest of the industry. Do you think this is just simply a function of end markets took another leg down here? Do you think perhaps some of your customers were delaying their inventory adjustments until they saw lead times for the rest of the industry come down? Because we know that's also some of your competitors lagged your lead time normalization. Perhaps that was a factor here? Dave Pahl : Yes. Chris, as you know, you can't pin it on one thing, especially we've got well over 100,000 customers and 80,000 products that we're managing. As Rafael was talking about, building inventory, we've got essentially all of our catalog products, or almost all of our catalog products, now immediately available on ti.com. And our objective with inventory and the capacity we're putting on place is to have our customer service metrics remain high, which means keeping lead times stable. So you know I think in some markets we've seen customers that have told us that they were planning and have built their capacity and their inventories to grow at 25% in the coming year and they showed up and their plans changed and they're only going to grow 10%, right? So they told us they won't be ordering product for some time as they, you know, equalize those numbers. They're still going to have healthy growth, but it's hard to put that across all of those 100,000 customers into one short concise statement. Have a follow on? Chris Caso : Yes, fair enough. And if you could help us with the impact of the underutilization right now, how much of a headwind is that providing right now on a cost to sales basis? And then on the other side of this, when we finally get to a recovery, what will be the right way to model this? Will there be a bigger snapback as some of the underutilization comes off or do we just kind of go back to sort of those mid-70s incremental margins and the way back up? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, so what I would tell you first, we don't quantify underutilization, but you can fairly reasonably back into it just looking at our numbers, our midpoint or range, our midpoint and then consider the depreciation, expected depreciation increase and it'd be relatively straightforward for you to back into something reasonable for first quarter on the underutilization impact there. Now after that, it's all going to depend on revenue and revenue expectations because of course, depending what those are in the second-half of the year, let's say 90-days from now, then that will be a big factor in determining how the factories will run. But the bigger picture is, you know, all this deployment of CapEx that we're doing is all on 300 millimeter, which has a 40% cost advantage versus 200 millimeter. Several questions people asked earlier, it has ITC benefits on that. So it's coming in at 25% discount on the ITC and we'll see how much we get on grants. So they fall through on those investments for many, many years will be very positive, I would say. So with that, Dave? Dave Pahl : Yes, thank you, Rafael. Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to sharing our capital management update next Thursday, February 1 at 10 a.m. Central Time, as I mentioned earlier. And a replay of this call will be available shortly on our website. Good evening. Operator : And this concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Dave Pahl : Welcome to the Texas Instruments First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates : First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I will provide insight into first quarter revenue results, with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our end-markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management, as well as share the guidance for the second quarter of 2024. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter : Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $3.7 billion, a decrease of 10% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 14% year-over-year, and Embedded Processing declined 22%. Our Other segment declined 33% from the year-ago quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our first quarter revenue by end-market. Revenue declined sequentially across all of our end-markets. Our results reflect the current environment, as customers continue to reduce their inventory levels. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance, as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down upper-single digits. The automotive market was down mid-single digits. Personal electronics was down mid-teens. Next, communications equipment was down about 25%. And lastly, enterprise systems was down mid-teens. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Thanks Dave, and good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned, first quarter revenue was $3.7 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion, or 57% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with reduced factory loadings and our planned capacity expansions. Gross profit margin decreased 820 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $933 million, flat from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion, or 22% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.3 billion in the quarter, or 35% of revenue, and was down 34% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $1.1 billion or $1.20 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.10 benefit that was not in our original guidance, primarily due to the sale of a property. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion in the quarter and $6.3 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in the quarter and $5.3 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $940 million. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends, and in the past 12 months, we returned $4.8 billion to our owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $10.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. In first quarter, we issued $3 billion in debt. Total debt outstanding is now $14.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.8%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, up $84 million from the prior quarter and days were 235, up 16 days sequentially. For the second quarter we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.25. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be about 13%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add-value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad-product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Rafael, I'm wondering if you can give us an update on any CHIPS Act money that you may have gotten. I know, basically all the money for the advanced nodes has been allocated and has been announced, but there is still like $9 billion outstanding for mature nodes. So can you kind of talk about that for us? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. No, happy to do it. First let me address the grants, which I think is what you're referring to. On that, frankly we don't have an update to give. We're still going through that process. Submitted our application late last year, we are working through the details with the CHIPS Program Office. As we said before, we believe our investments in manufacturing in both Texas and Utah are well-positioned with the objectives of the CHIPS Program Office. Now let me give you an update on the ITC, the Investment Tax Credit. To-date, we have accrued about $1.5 billion on that credit, and based on the recently released regulations, we will be receiving the ITC cash benefit throughout the year in 2024 and beyond. And starting next quarter, so in second quarter, we expect to receive about $300 million and a total of $1 billion for all of 2024. Okay, do you have a follow-up? Timothy Arcuri : I do, yeah. I wanted to ask about factory loadings and sort of where you think inventory goes for June. If I look at your guidance, the gross margins implied pretty flat ex-depreciation. So it seems like loadings have sort of leveled-off in June. Is that right? And kind of what do you expect for inventory in June? It seems like it should start to come down a tick maybe in June. Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Sure. Of course we give a guidance. We give a range on revenue, we give a range on EPS, and then 90 days from now, we'll discuss that more or less. But for now, I'll tell you that in first quarter, we adjusted factory loadings, as we neared our desired inventory levels. And as we said during the prepared remarks, we grew inventory about [$80-some million] (ph). And then for second quarter, we are going to adjust those loadings depending on future demand. Dave Pahl : Thank you Tim. We\u2019ll go to next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on that. If and when revenues begin to recover, how do we think about what that would imply for your factory utilization given your current inventory position, as well as additional capacity coming online, which I guess sort of just naturally gives a downward bias to utilization anyways? Like I guess, how long would you need to take utilizations up? Or how much revenue growth would you need to start taking utilizations up given your positioning on inventories and capacity additions? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So Stacy, it's a good question, but it's a complex question and is -- at the end of the day, it is going to depend. It's going to depend on a number of factors, what kind of revenue profile you \u2013 we are faced with and not just in one quarters or two quarters but really over a longer horizon. Maybe the best thing I can tell you is don't expect a significant or even any drain on inventory because just given our business model and how we want to run the company, keeping lead time short and also the upside potential that we have with having this inventory and the capacity in place, is so much higher than the downside risk. So hopefully, that gives you some -- some good insight into how we're thinking. Do you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon : I do. Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about pricing. So I think last quarter, you'd suggested that pricing was sort of resuming historical trends, which -- I think, it suggests it was down -- I think, it was low to mid-single digits. Is there any update on what you are seeing in terms of the pricing environment? Is that still the environment that we are in? Are things better -- are things worse? Like where do you see that going as we go forward? Dave Pahl : Yes. Stacy, I'll comment on that. And as I said last quarter, really we began seeing things change mid-last year -- in the back half of last year as we began discussions with customers for their demand in the following year and out in time, whatever those pricing windows would open up. And those are really just going back to what we've seen in the last 10 years, 20 years kind of pre-pandemic. So describe it roughly in the low to very low single-digit declines over time. And I would say, just generally that's what we are continuing to see. Rafael Lizardi : Let me add one more thing, Stacy. I want to give you a bonus answer. You always ask about OpEx. So you are not asking, but I'm going to give you OpEx. Remember that second quarter has a full three months of raises whereas first quarter only had two months of raises. So it's something for your modeling. Stacy Rasgon : Thank you. Dave Pahl : Thank you Stacy. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question. Vivek Arya : Thank you for taking my question. I think in the prepared remarks, you said customers continue to reduce inventory levels, but you are also guiding Q2 sales to be up 4% sequentially. So my question is, should we think of Q2 as kind of a normal seasonal quarter? Just any more color on what you are seeing real time. Are we past the industry inventory correction? Are we kind of getting back to some semblance of -- on normalcy from a demand perspective? Any other color you could give from an end-market or geo perspective. Just -- you are the largest, right most influential vendor in the market. So I think, your perspectives would be very useful to understand where we are in the inventory and the broader demand cycle. Dave Pahl : Yes. Vivek, let me start with what we saw happen in the last quarter because I think, it's helpful. First, we saw personal electronics was the first market that went into the correction. It really is -- was the first to come out in the last few quarters, I'd describe it as behaving more seasonal. If you go to the other end of the spectrum, we have, had industrial, which has been declining sequentially from some time. And over the last few quarters, we've been talking about how there's some asynchronous behavior inside of the 12, 13 sectors that we have there. That continued inside of the quarter. So we have got some of the later-cycle sectors that are continuing to decline and declining at double-digit rates. But there are some that are beginning to -- begin to slow in the declines and even a couple that grew sequentially. So that I would just describe as being more mixed this quarter, which is certainly different than last quarter. So -- and if you look -- historically, second quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for us. So it's not unusual for us to see sequential growth sequentially. Do you have a follow-on? Vivek Arya : Yeah, thank you Dave. Maybe if I press a little bit on that. For Q2, specifically industrial and automotive, do you think -- is your assumption that customers will continue to work down inventory? Or do you think that they have worked down most of the inventory and we are getting back to some semblance of what normal demand looks like for TI in Q2? Like what does your guidance actually imply that are we below seasonal? Are we seasonal? Or -- are we something different? Dave Pahl : Well, again, we're not in the practice of giving guidance by end-market. And -- but even inside of last quarter, as we looked at it inside of industrial, there obviously were some customers that are nearing the end of that inventory depletion cycle. So as you know, we don't -- we try to be very cautious and not to try to predict tops or bottoms or those types of things and just report what we see and just stick to the facts. So thank you Vivek. We\u2019ll go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Thomas O'Malley: Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Mine is in regards to China. 2023 data came out recently, and it looks like some of the larger North American players didn't really lose share despite some concerns on the trailing edge that you would have some increased China competition. Can you talk -- has there been any change in the way that customer behavior has kind of trended over the last couple of months? And can you talk about just that competitive environment? Are you seeing more players there? Are you seeing players that you didn't see before? Any color on China would be super useful. Thank you. Dave Pahl : Sure. Yes. Thanks, Tom for that question. And I\u2019d say, no change over the last couple of months. But I think, certainly over the last few years, there's many things that are changing in China. We've got very competent local competitors there as well as there\u2019s subsidized capacity going in place. And when you compare that to five years or 10 years ago, is it harder to compete there? It certainly is. But again, I would not describe that as a competitive landscape that's changing overnight. And we've talked about that for some years. So China is an important market for us that -- it continues to be a growing market. And we can and will compete there to support our customers. So our competitive advantages, whether that's our manufacturing and technology, the breadth of the portfolio, the reach of the markets all [serve] (ph) us very, very well in China. Do you have a follow-on? Thomas O'Malley: Yes. Just on auto particularly. I know that you're not guiding the out quarter, but just conversations that you've had since you last updated us with those customers? I think you just mentioned that inventories are coming down. But through the pandemic, there was a kind of change of stated ordering patterns of just-in-time to just-in-case. Do you see that kind of persisting -- or do you think that we are moving back to a situation in which customers really want to have much lower inventory on their balance sheet. Obviously, you have a unique supply chain, but just any thoughts on just the auto environment, particularly through the last several months. Thank you. Dave Pahl : Sure. Yes. Thanks again, Tom. I would say that many customers and especially those in automotive, as they went through and dealt with the disruptions that they had in supply chains actually we are very thoughtful in looking at where their supply is coming from, what things that they can do differently well beyond just carrying extra days of inventory. And when they went through that analysis, I think many found that they have a pretty significant dependence on wafers coming out of both China and Taiwan. And what they described that to us is geopolitically dependable capacity is what they're seeking. And again, we have talked about that before in our capital management updates. We believe that -- that's going to be highly sought after it is -- we are seeing that today. And so I think, we are in a position to be able to support customers, and that growth that will come from that. So thank you Tom, we will go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Ross Seymore : Hi guys thanks. I'm going to ask a couple of questions. I guess for the first one, Dave, I know you don't want to guide by the segments but you gave the quarter-over-quarters. Could you give us what the year-over-years were by end-market in the first quarter, please? Dave Pahl : I can do that, yes. So the industrial market was down about 25% from a year ago. Automotive was down lower single digits. Personal electronics was actually up single digits. Comms equipment was down about 50%, and enterprise system was down mid-teens. Do you have a follow-on, Ross? Ross Seymore : I do. Rafael, you talked a little bit about the trajectory of the grant side of the CHIPS Act -- or excuse me, the ITC side and where you are getting the money in over time. Does any of that inflows of cash have a differing impact on the income statement? Or is it just the same, it's just a matter of timing and when you're getting that $1 billion as opposed to, I think you said $500 million before? Rafael Lizardi : Right. No, no direct impact on the income statement. That's already played in as the lower depreciation and are already flowing through the P&L and in our expectations on depreciation. Of course, having more cash, does have an impact in terms of you have more cash, you're going to have more interest income. But put that aside, that's kind of below the profit the operating profit line. So speaking of depreciation, let me give you an update on that. We've been talking about depreciation for this year, $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. That is -- we continue to expect that -- but we're more likely to come in at the bottom half of that range. And for 2025, we continue to expect $2 billion to $2.5 billion in depreciation. Dave Pahl : Thank you Ross. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Danely with Citibank. Please proceed with your question. Chris Danely : Hey, thanks guys. Rafael, just another question on the balance sheet and cash. So you guys have seen the share count kind of flatten out here for the last 4 quarters or 5 quarters and then you're building cash and increasing your debt. I guess what's changed? Traditionally, you've sort of taken the share count down slowly but steadily. Any sort of changes in the long-term thinking there on cash, usage of cash, et cetera? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. When it comes to capital management, it all depends, and it depends on circumstances. And at the moment our objective when it comes to -- you've known us for a while. We return all cash flow \u2013 [or cash] (ph) flow to the owners of the company, and we do that over time. But there are times to increase liquidity and to build up cash. So you have seen us over the last couple of years do that and steadily increase the cash on the balance sheet. We finished at $10.4 billion last quarter. And we've done that very consciously, right to protect the investments that we're making, particularly the $5 billion per year CapEx investments in manufacturing because that is the most important allocation of capital has been for the last few years and will continue to be for the next three years. So with that in mind, we've had that in mind as we have made overall capital allocation decisions, including the decisions on repurchases. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Chris? Chris Danely : Yes, thanks Dave. Just another question on China but more on the, I guess, the insourcing side. So some of your competitors have talked about this impacting them. Do you guys see an impact of this on TI? Would or will this alter your long-term, I guess growth expectations or thoughts on your China business? Just any color there would be very helpful. Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So I'll start and, Dave, if you want to chime in. But as Dave alluded to earlier on the call, China is a very important market. We need to compete there, we do compete there and we compete to win there. China, there -- it's pretty clear that there's an incentive to design local semiconductor suppliers. I think, that's what you're referring to as insourcing. And today, that share, my guess -- my sense is 10% to 15% of the local content is sourced by local semiconductor suppliers. I think, the exact number is 12%, the one I saw. So that means there's another 88% that -- that is shared now between U.S. and European suppliers. And our goal is to continue that fight and maintain and gain that share, competing with local suppliers but also competing with US and European semiconductor suppliers. Dave Pahl : Yes. And maybe I'll just add in China -- in any market, we've just got to have the best parts. And when we have that -- that means we've got to be ahead of competitors, whether that's on performance, on support, availability and cost. So -- and we have customers in every region that are beginning to think about where they're sourcing products from. So customers that aren't in China are looking at our -- as they describe it, geopolitically dependable capacity. And that's about 80% of our revenue. The 20% that's in China, we have customers in China that have and support global markets. And they're coming and describing our geopolitical dependable capacity and wanting to have access to it because it is very unique. We're the only ones that are building at scale outside of China and Taiwan capacity. So customers understand that. They understand it both in China, as well as outside. So thank you for that Chris. We will go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. I've asked this question before, but it keeps coming up. Can you talk about how you think about pricing kind of more strategically as you contemplate having a decent amount of capacity, more 300 millimeter capacity, more subsidization? Does that change the pricing paradigm at all? Are there markets where you might be more price-aggressive than you wouldn't be, if any of that were different? Dave Pahl : Yes. Joe, the answer will be amazingly consistent with how you've asked it before. But we haven't changed our strategy on pricing. You know that pricing doesn't move quickly in our industry, and it -- isn't the primary reason why customers choose our products overall. So we regularly monitor pricing for all of our products. That includes all end markets and all product categories and all regions. And we price to be competitive, and we can do that because we've got a great product portfolio and we've got great access to the markets through our channels. And we've got competitive products because we build it on 300 millimeter. So hopefully, that's amazingly consistent. Do you have a follow-on? Joe Moore : Yeah. Thank you for that. Yes, in terms of the embedded business, I know you've had a number of kind of vertical markets that you de-emphasized and things like that with kind of a focus on more of a core kind of catalog strategy in that business. Where are you in that? Do you expect that you would -- that your embedded business would sort of track the broader microcontroller business? Or just how do you think about the transitions that are happening there? Dave Pahl : Yes. I think that we continue to make progress overall in our embedded business. The goal there is to have that business growing and contributing to our free cash flow over a long time. We think it's a great business and continue to invest. So we are very happy with that strategic progress. So I think, in the near-term, of course, we're not going to be immune to cycle-related corrections. It is a little bit later because of the constraints that we have due to embedded relying on foundry supply. And as you know, we are investing to put capacity in place. And we'll have control of that in the future and really are in a good position to gain share there. So thank you for that Joe, we will go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you. Dave, I had a question about the Q4 -- I mean the Q2 outlook. So I know, obviously, you can't guide by market and things like that. But from a bookings perspective, are we starting to see sort of a broad-based recovery in bookings? Or would you still say it's quite selective in all the different applications that you are targeting? Dave Pahl : Yes. So let me speak to bookings at the top level. We saw bookings increase each month of the quarter. That is very typical that we would see in a first quarter. I don't have bookings by end market. If there's something very unusual going on, of course, that would jump out at us. So that's just not something I have here in front of me. But I would describe it as behaving as we would expect it to. And of course those bookings and other demand signals that we get from our customers are obviously [imbued] (ph) into our guidance. Do you have a follow-on, Tore? Tore Svanberg : Yes. That's very helpful. As my follow-up, you mentioned there's a few segments within the industrial category that are starting to grow or perhaps have found the bottom from an inventory correction perspective. Can you talk about which segments those are? Dave Pahl : Yes. Again, as we talked about over the last several quarters now that there was markets that were behaving -- or sectors that were behaving asynchronously. So there are shorter cycle investment sectors that began to roll earlier, longer-term investment cycles that were rolling later, really just the last couple of quarters into it. So it is really -- if you had to kind of divide them out, that's what they would look like. Thank for you that Tore, we will go to the next caller please. And this will be our last caller. Operator : Our last question is from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Chris Caso : Yes. Thanks. Good evening. First question is related to the buybacks, and I think you addressed this in a prior question. But I guess the question is, what would be the trigger for being able to resume some degree of buybacks? We realize that the intention is to return 100% of excess free cash flow. But at what point does the cash in the balance sheet and kind of industry conditions allow you to kind of come back to what you've been doing previously? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. Well a couple of things. For example, the data point I will give you is our free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $940 million. And we returned in -- also in trailing 12 months, $4.8 billion. So one catalyst for a change there would be once we're past this investment phase that is consuming a good chunk of that free cash flow. Another catalyst is obviously revenue and how that behaves over a number of years. But -- so these are just some of the puts and takes that we think about when we are allocating capital. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Chris? Chris Caso : I do. Thanks. And I guess the question is about where TI is allocating the R&D investment going forward and how that may be changing. Over last year, it looks like auto industrial is about 70% of your revenue, and I know that's by design. But you've got some segments such as comm equipment that have been down a lot more. As we look out over the next two years or so, do you think that percentage of revenue on the segments kind of stays about where it is right now? Or based on the R&D investments you are making, do you think that changes substantially? Dave Pahl : Yes. And it's a great question, Chris. So let me just use as a backdrop for those that hadn't looked at our capital management slide deck. And Slide 21, shows our percentage of our revenue by end-market. And the middle column there talks about what we're doing directionally from an R&D spend. So -- and we've talked about for some time that -- our belief that there is going to be secular trends and increasing semiconductors and industrial and automotive. And as a result of that, we have been taking investments up there. And the other markets though, if you look at personal electronics and communications equipment, our investments there have been and continue to be very steady because we can find great opportunities inside of those markets. And so we'll continue those investments. And then enterprise systems, we've taken up the investments there slightly. And there is just opportunities, and enterprise systems likely will be a good grower as well. It doesn't have quite the same dynamics, as industrial and automotive for us. But certainly, things that sit inside of enterprise we believe will make that an above-average grower over the next decade [plus] (ph). So with that, I'll turn it over to Rafael to wrap up. Rafael Lizardi : Okay. Thanks, Dave. Let me wrap up by emphasizing what we have said previously. At our core, we are engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we're personally proud to be a part of and would [want] (ph) as our neighbor. When we're successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : This concludes today's conference.

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Haviv Ilan; and our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, he'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management as well as share the guidance for the third quarter of 2024. With that, let me turn it over to Haviv. Haviv Ilan : Thanks, Dave. Let me also start by welcoming everyone to the call. I'm looking forward to joining our quarterly earnings calls moving forward and sharing more details about our business strategy with the investment community. It is an opportunity for me to directly share more information about our results and our strategic progress. With that, I'll start with a quick overview of the second quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $3.8 billion, an increase of 4% sequentially and a decrease of 16% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 11% year-over-year, and Embedded Processing declined 31%. Our other segment declined 22% from the year ago quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by end-market. Our results continue to reflect the asynchronous behavior across our end-markets that we've seen throughout this cycle. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. First, the Industrial market was down low-single digits. The Automotive market was down mid-single digits. Personal Electronics grew mid-teens with broad-based growth while demonstrating continued improvement compared to its low point in the first quarter of 2023. Next, Communication Equipment was up mid-single digits. And finally, Enterprise Systems was up about 20%. Lastly, before I pass it on to Rafael, I'd like to share a few comments regarding our capacity investments. We and our customers remain pleased with our progress of the expansion of our 300-millimeter manufacturing capacity. These investments reflect our confidence in the opportunity ahead, which remains high for several reasons. First, we have a high level of confidence in the secular growth of semiconductor content, particularly in industrial and automotive, where we have greater exposure and strong product positions. Second, geopolitically dependable low-cost 300-millimeter capacity will be increasingly critical and valuable and our investments enable us to support customer demand at scale. To share more details on our progress, which we believe is helpful for all of our shareholders to understand, I plan to hold an off-cycle capital management call with Rafael and Dave on August 20th. During the call, I will provide more granularity on our capacity investments along with the framework of revenue and free cash flow per share scenarios. With that, let me turn it over to Rafael to review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, second-quarter revenue was $3.8 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.2 billion or 58% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit margin increased 60 basis points, primarily due to higher revenue as well as lower manufacturing unit costs due to increased factory loadings and more manufacturing internally with more wafers on 300-millimeter. Operating expenses in the quarter were $963 million, up 3% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion, or 23% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.2 billion in the quarter, or 33% of revenue, and was down 37% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.1 billion, or $1.22 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.6 billion in the quarter and $6.4 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.1 billion in the quarter and $5 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.5 billion. As a reminder, free cash flow includes benefits from the CHIPS Act investment tax credit, which was $312 million for second quarter. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $71 million of our stock. In total, we returned $4.9 billion to our owners in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.7 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we repaid $300 million of debt. Total debt outstanding is now $14 billion with a weighted-average coupon of 3.8%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, up $23 million from the prior quarter and days were 229, down 6 days sequentially. For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.94 billion to $4.26 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.48. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be about 13%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for a follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. There were some comments from a geopolitical perspective. One of the candidates is talking about the China-Taiwan relationship. And I'm just asking how the geopolitical environment is sort of impacting your customers' buying decisions. I think you said last call that even some of your Chinese customers who are exporting product want geopolitically dependable capacity. I think you talked about that being kind of an increasingly big factor in autos. Can you talk about that and is that beginning to drive some share gains for you? Haviv Ilan : Thanks, Tim. I'll take that. It's Haviv. First, geopolitical dependable capacity is not a new thing for us. We've started to see these requests coming, I think two or three years ago when tensions started to rise, but as we reflect on it now three years in, it's obvious that there is more and more attention usually at the highest levels of our customers. I'm talking about leadership of CEOs or Chief Purchasing Officers, looking at their supply chain and making sure that they are going to be immune from you know whatever is thrown at them, part of it is geopolitical tensions. And this is where TI is a great answer. We are a very unique supplier in the sense of we can provide the capacity at scale, meaning the amount of wafers and the size of our -- the capacity that we are building is very high. It is a very affordable capacity as building our parts on 300-millimeter wafers allows for a lower cost per chip and then building them internally in our assembly and test houses also provides a very good low-cost structure. And last but not least is this geopolitically dependable capacity, meaning our fabs are being built in the US, mainly in Texas and in Lehi, Utah and we provide a capacity that is at scale, affordable, and dependable. And yes, every time there is some news out there, you know, we are seeing more interest. We've seen that grown over the last several years, and in that sense, our discussions with our customers are providing us more opportunity to win positions in future platforms. I do believe we are taking a bigger share and this is part of our confidence to continue with our investments to serve that opportunity moving forward. Last but not least, you have touched China. Yes, you're right. If I take an example and just on the automotive side, our customers in China do care a lot about their export business. In that sense, our capacity is highly welcomed by them because we can compete at the market price with a very competitive offering, yet have that dependability to serve their customers not only in China but also outside of China for their export business. Dave Pahl : Follow-on, Tim? Timothy Arcuri : I do. Yes. Rafael, can you give us an update on CHIPS Act? Do you know how much you're getting yet? And can you kind of talk about that? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, sure, Tim. So on the grant, frankly, we're still going through the process. So we submitted the application and we're just working through the details with the CHIPS program office. But given your question, let me comment also on the ITC the Investment Tax Credit. Today, to date, we have accrued about $1.8 billion in total, that's under 25% ITC. This benefit already started flowing through the income statement as lower depreciation. In addition, in second quarter, we received, as I said in the prepared remarks, $312 million of cash benefits and that is reflected in operating and free cash flow. And we expect to receive another $200 million in 3Q and for a total of $1 billion for 2024. Timothy Arcuri : Great. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Tim. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. In Q2, it looked like the strength was primarily from personal electronics, given industrial and auto were down. And maybe calculators as well, I don't know other was pretty strong. I was wondering if you could give us some color on where your expectations for the growth in Q3 sequentially is coming from. Is it still primarily at personal electronics? And I guess maybe calculators or other stuff? How do I think about the end-market trends as we go forward into next quarter? Haviv Ilan : Thanks for the question. Stacy, I'll start and I'll let Dave add some more color on Q2. So if I go back to the second quarter, yes, if you look at our results, industrial did decline at the low-single digits. Automotive continued to decline at mid-single digits. That was the third quarter in a row of that decline. Although from a year-over-year perspective, it's still doing well, meaning less than 10% of a decline. It declined about 9% in Q2. Yes, there is strength in personal electronics and I do see that market at -- you know it went down through the entire cycle. It troughed sometime in the first quarter of 2023 and we've seen that market strengthening. And again, it grew mid-teens sequentially, but close to 20% year-over-year. So there is definitely strength over there. And I would also say that on the enterprise market, yes, smaller revenue for us, but we are seeing a recovery over there, and I believe that inventory correction is behind us. Regarding the Other business, it grew thanks to our calculator business, as you mentioned, but also our DLP business, which mainly serves the personal electronics market. And Dave, maybe you can add some more color on the sectors as we talked about Q2. Dave Pahl : Yes. I think as we have seen even inside of industrial, we've had sectors behave asynchronously. So when we first began to see weakness in industrial, which really began in the third quarter, that was -- that was the peak in third quarter of 2022. That was the peak in industrial and we talked about seeing about half of the sectors or so show weakness and those early, but I'll call them earlier-stage sectors, some of them have found bottoms and begun to grow and you can see some of that bottoming process taking place. The others, we're only three or so quarters in and we've got several of them that are continuing to decline at double-digit rates. So again, as we've seen all of our markets behave asynchronously inside of the sectors, we've seen that in industrial as well. Do you have a follow-on, Stace? Stacy Rasgon : I do actually. Maybe to re-ask the same question. So you're guiding a revenue sequentially up close to $300 million. How do I think about that $300 million growth parsing out across the end markets into Q3? Haviv Ilan : Yes, Stacy, I'm on the calls, but still we are not going to predict or to give a guidance by market for the third quarter. I mean, it's at the midpoint of the range. We expect revenue to grow about 7%. But as you know, it's not unusual for us to see sequential growth in the third quarter. I mean, typically this is a seasonal -- Stacy Rasgon : Is it TE, is what I'm asking, is it mostly -- Haviv Ilan : Yes, typically Q3 is a quarter where if you go back to pre-COVID days, this is the quarter where customers are preparing their end equipment or the end-product for the holiday season. So it's usually a strong quarter for the company and we are seeing that a very similar behavior right now at the midpoint of our -- of the range of our forecast. I don't know, Dave, if you want to add anything. Dave Pahl : I think that's good. Haviv Ilan : Okay. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Stacy. And we'll go to the next caller. Stacy Rasgon : Thank you, guys. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the China market and what you're seeing in terms of not just the demand side, but are you seeing any incremental supply coming on that can create a concern from a pricing perspective? Because every time this question is asked to industries or not just TI, the answer is always that, well, the IP is not there, they don't have product breadth and whatnot, but they're still buying a lot of trailing edge equipment. So at what point Haviv does that start to become a concern from just a global capacity and global pricing perspective for Texas Instruments? Haviv Ilan : Thanks, Vivek. Let me start with the first part of your question on how the China market did because I think it was a good quarter for our China business. Our China headquarters business grew sequentially at about 20% versus the first quarter. And we've seen the momentum across all markets. I mean, all five markets grew sequentially, I think 15% or 20%. So they all did well. And this is after seven quarters of sequential decline. So if you think about the way I look at the China market and it was exposed to all -- to all market -- to all end-markets for TI, it took seven quarters for this asynchronous cycle to go through starting with PE, Personal Electronics, then spreading to Industrial and Enterprise and just slightly to Automotive. But all of these have now corrected and Q2 was a good quarter for our business. And I believe we are now shipping to end demand, meaning customers have stopped managing their inventories over there. Now in terms of the competition in China, I don't think that's -- I mean, we've been very vocal about it. This is first not new that the competition has intensified over the last -- the past several years and I think it's growing stronger. I think it's a mistake for us to think that these guys are only doing simple parts. These are very ambitious, highly educated competitors. And our job here in TI, and that's what I try to teach the team is to compete. And I will tell you that, yes, the market is more competitive in China, but we can compete and we can win business in very attractive margins. So we are going to continue to do that. Our goal -- objective is to continue and gain market share in China. Dave Pahl : Yes. And if I just add one thing, Haviv, the growth in China that we saw was strong across all the markets, including automotive and industrial there. So -- Haviv Ilan : Correct. Dave Pahl : So, I think that's an important point. So, Vivek, you have a follow-on? Vivek Arya : Yes. Thank you, Dave. So I know for Q3, you're not giving specific end-market commentary, but just from an industry perspective, how would you describe the supply-demand situation in industrial and automotive semis just because we see such a broad range of data points? Do you think we are past the worst in terms of inventory adjustment and supply issues for those two end markets? And if you could describe the situation in those two markets separately, that would be really, really helpful. Thank you. Haviv Ilan : Dave, I'll let you take this one. Dave Pahl : Okay. Yes, I think of what we can see, Vivek. Of course, we don't get any data feeds on customer inventory. We don't get any data feeds on customer shipments, but we can look into things like the order patterns, we can look at feeds that we get in consignment. We can see what's happening in with our inventories and our position. So as we've talked about, cancellations as an example, as a measure have continued to come down. Our lead times I described is very stable. We've got immediate availability of almost all of our products. So that does drive a lower visibility with backlog because customers can get product when they need it. And we do believe that some markets PE bottomed up back in first quarter of 2023 and has been more seasonal since then. We've seen some of the other markets that as we've shared earlier, are beginning to grow. So there's likely a bottom forming it with within some of those markets. We've got industrial and automotive that have continued to decline. Now I'd say with industrial, I mentioned earlier, some of the sectors are forming a bottom, others are continuing to decline. And automotive, where we've got three quarter behind us, right. So that's how as we look into where we are positioned today, but we don't have a strong signal that can tell us exactly to be able to answer the question that you asked. Haviv Ilan : Yes, the only one comment I will add, Vivek, in terms of the difference. So automotive so far at least just year-to-date is down mid-single digits and that is off of a very good 2023 for us, right. We grew about 17% in 2023. And I think it's just helped by the strong secular content growth that we see in automotive. And this is across the -- both combustion engines of ICE and EVs. So that's maybe the difference -- the slight difference I see between these two markets. Dave Pahl : Okay. Thank you, Vivek. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Ross Seymore : Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Haviv, it's great to have you on the call. So I'll ask one for you and maybe Rafael would chime in as well. You guys have given at least Rafael in the past some mid-quarter updates or earnings call updates on capex and depreciation versus your pre-existing plan. So are you still planning to spend $5 billion a year? And is the depreciation ranges, Rafael, you gave before still apply or are we going to have some more flexibility on those metrics going forward? Haviv Ilan : Yes. Okay, I'll start and Rafael maybe you can provide some more color. So first, again, our strategy has not changed and it continues to serve us well. As I said before, the secular growth in industrial and automotive and our position, our market position, and our product portfolio position gives us the confidence that there is a higher opportunity over there. On top of it, as we said earlier, customers do want and value geopolitically dependable capacity. So we are pleased with our progress. Our CapEx strategy provide us both with capacity for growth and flexibility. And at the end of the day, CapEx supports revenue growth and need to be prepared for different scenarios. Now we always continue to evaluate our plans and investments based on what we see on the demand environment, the dynamics, the growth opportunities in the market. And to talk more about it, we -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we see our -- we are going to have our off-cycle capital management call in a month, in four weeks, just an opportunity to share just additional insight. So we'll go through our investment plan with more granularity on what exactly we are doing per factory and then we'll provide a framework of revenue scenarios and what would free cash flow per share and CapEx do, you know, versus each and every scenario. And regarding depreciation, Rafael, I don't know if you want to add anything. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So I'll just comment on depreciation. Ross, I'm going to narrow that depreciation range a little bit both for 2024 and 2025. So for 2024, we now expect depreciation to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. And for 2025, we now expect depreciation to be about $2 billion to $2.3 billion. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Ross? Ross Seymore : I do, and thanks for all those details, Haviv, and Rafael. So one for you, Rafael. If I heard you right on the gross margin rising in the second quarter, you mentioned that loadings increased. I thought that they were going to decrease to burn some inventory now that you had that at kind of the $4 billion target. So did something change there? And what's the expectations for utilization going forward? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So the loadings came in about as expected, but let me just tell you more about it. Second quarter loadings were up versus first quarter. And as you saw, we were essentially flat on inventory. So essentially the ins and out where pretty much offsetting. When it comes to third quarter, we expect utilization or factory loadings to be flat to slightly up. And in our base-case for our -- the EPS guidance that we have, that's what we have in there. But of course, we have time during the quarter to adjust those loading depending on what we expect for fourth quarter. On GPM specifically for third quarter, I would -- in the base-case, at the midpoint of our guidance, I would expect GPM percent to be up versus the second quarter. Ross Seymore : Thank you, Dave. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Ross, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danley with Citibank. Please proceed with your question. Chris Danley : Hey, thanks for letting me ask a question, guys. Just to follow up on Ross' question in terms of gross margin. So depreciation is going up like 100 million bucks roughly per quarter for next year. But if utilization rates keep going up i.e., if nothing gets any worse, do you think -- is it possible that your gross margins are bottoming now? Or is there anything else that could drive them lower or maybe provide a tailwind, just give us maybe the mechanics around it for the next several quarters. Rafael Lizardi : Sure, sure. I'll be happy. And I'll keep it -- well, at the end of the day, yes, it is possible that is the case. It's all going to depend on revenue, of course. So the main driver is revenue. So as we -- and in addition to revenue, as we bring more executing our strategy to load more 300-millimeter wafers and bring in more external loadings internal, the fall-through excluding depreciation will likely trend more in the range of 75% to 85% on a year-on-year basis. Now, of course, any one quarter, even any one year, you may have puts and takes that you know utilization or factory loadings is one of those that sometimes it goes against you, sometimes it goes in favor. But in general, expect that fall-through in 75% to 85%, not counting depreciation. So you do the math, whatever revenue assumption you want to put over the next several quarters or years, do that fall-through and you can very easily model where -- and then I just gave you the depreciation, right. So you can then model what gross margins can do over the next several years. Chris Danley : Great. Thanks for the additional breadcrumbs. They're very useful. My follow-up is just on bookings. I think last quarter, you said that bookings were increasing every month. Is that still true? And do you think that for the industrial automotive space, we're at least getting close to the bottom there, or do you feel any better about either of those end markets on a relative basis? Dave Pahl : Yes. So again, as you look at those things, revenue did increase as well as orders throughout the quarter, which is very typical as that we would see in the second quarter. And certainly, as we've got growth at the midpoint, that would not be unexpected. Again, those other sides of lead times, really on all of our products, having immediate availability and stable lead times, cancellations continuing to decline. All those things, I think point to supply and demand becoming more in balance and that availability. So -- and there was a second part of your question, Chris, that I'm not addressing. I'm not sure what it was. Can you just repeat it for me? Chris Danley : Yes, it was just our bookings still increasing month over month. And then between the auto or the industrial end market, do you feel any better or worse about either of those? Dave Pahl : Well, yes, again, I think that we've got half of the sectors that again we can see forming a bottom inside of industrial overall that it's been elongated. But if you look at it sector by sector, it's probably a better view overall. And in auto, this is our third quarter of decline. We're down about 13% from where the revenue peaked. It's a pretty shallow decline compared to how the other markets had behaved so far. So that's what we see. So, thank you, Chris. [Multiple Speakers] Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Haviv, maybe one for you on CapEx and how you're thinking about your long-term revenue growth. You've always had this slide in your capital management call deck where you show revenue supported. I think you have for 2026, you have $30 billion for 2030 at $45 billion. I know you're constantly evaluating your plans and you talked about presenting various scenarios on the August call. But I'm curious, is the $30 billion for 2026 and $45 billion for 2030, are those still kind of the base case scenarios for you, or has there been any change post conversations with customers? Haviv Ilan : So, Toshiya first, I do want to leave something for August. So I think it's going to be just a better environment to go provide this information. We'll also provide supporting materials and we'll or updated presentation where you'll see, as I said, the different scenarios and how we see them. And to me, it's step-by-step. Right now when I think about how we establish our CapEx plan, we need to think about what the next peak wants to do. We'll discuss that. We'll discuss different scenarios of revenue leading to the next peak and what will CapEx do accordingly. And as a result, what free cash flow per share will be. Again, I don't want to give the whole a pitch right now, but I think it's going to be important for investors to join and hear our latest update. Toshiya Hari : Understood. Dave Pahl : Follow-on [indiscernible] Toshiya Hari : I do. Thanks, Dave. Just a question on Embedded Processing. Revenue was down sequentially and the year-over-year decline actually accelerated. Analog, we've seen some stabilization. So I'm just curious what you're seeing in the Embedded Processing side. Is this purely volume pressure, or is there a pricing or competitive component here as well? I think operating margins for that business came in a little bit as well sequentially. So just curious. Thank you. Haviv Ilan : Yes, let me start first on the high-level embedded -- the embedded business. So when I look at the underneath beyond the numbers, it's getting stronger. Our product portfolio is improving. And when I look at the -- at this decade, the -- just the opportunity for that business to be a major contributor for TI's growth of free cash flow per share is very high. So I'm very encouraged by the progress of the business. Now regarding the cycle, cycle first, embedded as a little bit of a different structure compared to analog. It's mainly composed of industrial and automotive. So it has less exposure into a personal electronics enterprise or communication equipment. And these two markets kind of pick later, right. So if you look at the embedded business versus analog, it picked a year-after kind of middle of 2023 versus the middle of 2022 for the analog business. In addition to that, the embedded business today, although as Rafael mentioned, it's being changed, was mainly supported from foundry wafers during the upcycle and we felt more limitation over there compared to our internal supply capacity. And so, now when these supply issues are resolved, we are seeing customers just adjusting their inventory. That's what I believe is happening and therefore, embedded is seeing that sharper correction. But again, when I look at it from the from the top, embedded is strengthening and I think it will continue to serve us very well moving forward. Rafael Lizardi : Let me just add on the operating profit question or angle that you had. Just as a reminder, as Haviv said, traditionally embedded has relied on external wafers, but we now have -- we're bringing them in and we have -- the Lehi factory is disproportionately will serve embedded, and therefore, embedded has taken a disproportionate amount of the fixed-cost charges there. But just like that is put right now, it will be a tailwind. It's a headwind now, it will be a tailwind in the future as we qualify more and more parts, embedded parts as well as analog at that Lehi factory. Toshiya Hari : It's very clear. Thank you so much. Dave Pahl : Have a great day. Next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Harlan Sur : Yes. Thank you for taking my question and great to have you on the call, Haviv. Maybe to follow up on the embedded question, right, because this business grew 3% last year versus your analog business, which was down 15%? Yes, year-to-date, it's down about as much as your peers or I would argue slightly better. You've articulated the positive strategy changes previously, right, more catalog, broad market focus. So bottom-line, again, over the past few years, it seems like you've made good improvements in this business. So as the team moves embedded more to internal manufacturing combined with the strategy shift, maybe, Haviv can you just comment on the design-win momentum? What areas are you particularly doing well in? And I'm not sure, Rafael, how should we think about the improvements in embedded margins as you move what was once mostly outsourced to internal manufacturing. Haviv Ilan : Yes. Let me start and I'll let Rafael add some more color. But again, as you mentioned, the embedded business has gone through change in the last four, five years and Amichai has done a great job to position the business such that it benefits our competitive advantages, thinking about manufacturing and technologies of shifting really from almost like 80% external to when done, maybe the opposite, 80% internally building a higher breadth of products or not less concentration of revenue per socket and us expanding our product portfolio, utilizing the reach of our market channels. Think about the large sales team of TI, think about TI.com, and the more Catalog is the product, the better fit to our strategy. So in that sense, that is moving well. In terms of design in momentum, again, it's mainly an industrial and automotive business. So very high visibility on the automotive side. But as you also know, it takes time. So I'm encouraged with the design-in momentum. Our funnel increased tremendously when I compare it to the analog side because every funnel of every supplier grows, but we've seen a disproportional growth of our design-in momentum for embedded versus previous year and also versus analog just in terms of the rates. And I will give some examples. We see good momentum in real-time control, think about EVs, onboard chargers, think about traction inverters, a very good momentum in connectivity, automotive, and beyond. Think about car entries, tire pressure monitoring, and other and body-related opportunities in the automotive market. I can continue with a -- the kind of our more application-specific products like our radar systems. We have great position and growing position in radar winning a lot of new business, both with the Tier-1s and the OEMs. This is a -- from imaging radar for the front to the corner radar to even parking assist and also in-cabin sensing, that radar is taking a bigger and bigger part in the automotive market. And many other examples on the industrial side, here the number of end equipment is really vast hundreds of end equipment, but this is where our catalog MCUs that we are really reviving the presence of TI and building a new portfolio based on our MSP family is doing very well in winning new business and across-the-board, across the markets, utilizing our channel advantage. So I can go on and on here, but again, just evidence of my excitement of what this business can do for us in the second half of this decade. Rafael? Rafael Lizardi : Yes, I'll just add on your question on fall-throughs for embedded, of course, we don't give guidance separate for the segment. So the 75% to 85% gross margin fall-through ex-depreciation that I talked about earlier applies to both. Haviv Ilan : Yes. Rafael Lizardi : Outside of -- if we didn't have Lehi and I'll address that in a second, we didn't have that, I would say generally analog would be at the higher end of that range and better would be at the lower end. But for the next year, two or three because Lehi, all those costs are -- all those fixed costs are already there, including people, we are going to have some nice tailwind and all of the -- a good portion of that will go to embedded. But over the longer timeframe, 75% to 85% ex-depreciation is a good guide to use. Dave Pahl : Yes, follow-on Harlon? Harlan Sur : Yes. In terms of channel reach, right, we haven't heard you guys talk about ti.com in quite some time. I think the last data point we've got was it drove about $2 billion in sales in calendar 2022 and it sort of has this additional benefit from a business planning perspective of being a really good sort of leading indicator of demand inflections. As you've sort of potentially past the bottom of sort of the current cycle here, wondering if there's been any notable movement or trends in ti.com. And maybe from a longer-term perspective, like what initiatives has the team put in place to sort of further improve the customer pull to ti.com from a mid to longer-term perspective? Haviv Ilan : Yes. Let me start more in the mid to longer term and then let Dave add some more color on how it looks versus the cycle. So in terms of the investment in tI.com, yes, they are continuing. These are very strategic and important investments for us. We believe there is a huge opportunity to digitize what we call the last mile or that interface between us and the customers. There are many, many customers, still a long tail of customers that we can't see today. But as they move to ti.com, we can supply with them with more information, we can even provide an opportunity to place backlog electronically, directly with TI. And in that sense, the importance for us is to just know our customers better, understand the end equipment, and provide the relevant product portfolio to serve their growth and win market share, right? So that data is to us very, very important that the direct connectivity with the customer is important. To do just that, we are investing in IT systems. We are investing in warehouses or if you will, logistics to serve these customers just in time as they needed and that is part of the way customers would opt to TI and just connect directly to us. Now in terms of the short-term, Dave, maybe you can talk a little bit about what we're seeing there through the cycle. Dave Pahl : Yes. And as we would -- have expected, orders that are placed through ti.com are down significantly from its peak, just, I think just telling of where we are with availability of product. But the great thing with ti.com is customers connect through APIs and put their planning systems on that. When they do have a shortage, they can look into our inventory, they can see it, some have even automated that process and have products shipped in many cases the same day. So we think the long-term strategic value of ti.com is much higher than the transaction that will cross it here in the short-term. So, thank you, Harlan. We can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Moore : Great. Thank you. I wonder just as you kind of think about this longer-term strategy, you've got well over 200 days of inventory, you have relatively low factory utilization. Like do you think this means we won't have shortages down the road that people can look at the capacity that you have, the inventory that you have and they won't have the need to accumulate inventory? Is that part of the thinking? Or do you think it's just inevitable that we'll get back to that at some point? Haviv Ilan : Again, the investment first in capacity ahead of the demand and then in inventory is done to really improve customer service, right. And we believe it's important to keep that not only now when it's kind of easy and the -- we have a market cycle at you can call it at a low-point. The test for our company would be at the next up-cycle, okay, not only in upcycle, it is -- you can model, Joe, any upcycle that you want, but we want to be supporting our customers at the highest level even if the cycle looks like a very steep one. And we model, for example, the COVID cycle as a similar one and that's what drives our investments. I think it's very, very important to sell your customers ahead of the competition at times like that because that's the opportunity to gain share and we are going to be prepared for that opportunity. Having said that, all that is done in a very thoughtful way. Inventory is being built at the right part where we have this diversity and longevity position such that we don't risk the scrap of the inventory. And I'm pleased with the progress we've made, but the test will come and I'm sure it will come one day at the next up-cycle. I don't know if you want to add anything, Dave. Dave Pahl : That's good. Joe, do you have a follow-up? Joseph Moore : Yes. I mean, just to follow up on that, to that, to the extent that your competition is doing things more the way they traditionally have and probably will see boom-bust cycles, what happens in that next upturn if they can't get parts from three of your competitors, is there a way you can keep them from accumulating inventory of TI components, even though they shouldn't need to. I mean, that seems like it's part of kind of the industry behavior in the past. Just how focused are you on trying to dampen that? Haviv Ilan : Yes. Well, again, I think our capacity and the inventory level that we have built are such that we tend to provide good or very high customer service levels, right. So our intention is to maintain lead times through the cycle. We -- it depends what cycle you throw, you throw at us. There is always going to be that one cycle or that steep cycle that maybe we won't be able to do it. But we have modeled the company in such a way that in most a demand situation, we would be able to maintain a good customer or hike customer service levels through the cycle, which hopefully will keep the lead times short and which I'm pretty sure we will encourage customers not to hoard inventory. That has to be proven, but that's the way we want to prepare for the future. Dave Pahl : Yes. Joseph Moore : Very helpful. Thank you. Dave Pahl : And if I added one thing, I'd just say that I spent eight years in sales, a joke I never once took a double order and so trying to control customer behavior when things get short, people want to build more inventory, right? And so that's just the behavior that I think that will be in our industry for the foreseeable future, but we can gain share in those periods of time and that's the advantage of having the capacity in place. So that said, we'll go to the next call -- or next and last caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Chris Caso : Thank you. Yes, thanks. Good evening. The question is on your comment -- earlier comments on China. It sounds like that rebounded fairly robustly in the first quarter. Could you give some more color on what you're seeing within China? And then do you think -- do you feel that those Chinese customers are still burning their inventory? Are you still undershipping demand there? Haviv Ilan : Yes, thanks for the question. So first, I would say that in China, it's a -- there is a very distinct signal that customers have walked down their inventories. And we've seen that you know spreading through a time with the market. If you think about the asynchronous behavior that we have described of the different markets, we saw the same in China. The personal electronics business picked in China somewhere in 2021, enterprise and industrial sometimes in 2022, and then automotive picked sometimes in 2023. So you saw that peak spread over three years, which I think is the reason we saw such an elongated decline of seven quarters in a row and we went backwards to our history and it's been one of the longest, if not the longest cycle we have seen. But I can see clearly that it's mainly played out. Of course, we will always find pockets and a few sectors on the industrial -- in the industrial market that are still going through that, but it's very clear that once you start to shift to end demand, you will see such behavior of, in our case 20% sequential growth and that momentum is being built across the markets. All markets did very well in China, growing between 15% to 20% something percent, okay. So very robust, coherent and that's like a recovery looks like. Now we haven't seen that across the other markets. I will even tell you that areas like you know Europe and Japan are in an early phase and hopefully, it doesn't take seven quarters per geography, but China was kind of the first into the upcycle, the beginning of COVID, the first one to correct on the down and now to me, the first one kind of raising a very strong sequential growth with momentum. So that's the way I would summarize it without trying to imply that we'll see the same behavior in each and every other market. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Chris? Chris Caso : I do. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up and I'm sure this is another thing you'll address on the August call, but you narrowed the range for depreciation next year down a little bit. Last quarter, you talked about CapEx kind of being around this $5 billion level per year. It was down sequentially in the second quarter. Is $5 billion still a reasonable way of looking CapEx this year? Haviv Ilan : Yes. There is no news here strategically, but Rafael, maybe do you want to guide on CapEx? Rafael Lizardi : No, absolutely no. This year, $5 billion, what you saw in second quarter is just little puts and takes on a quarterly basis, but for 2024, $5 billion of CapEx and the depreciation numbers I gave are reflective of that. Dave Pahl : Okay. Haviv Ilan : So let me wrap up with what we've said previously. At our core, we are engineers. Our technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we'll continue to pursue our three ambitions. First, we will act like owners. We will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever-changing and we will be a company that we are personally proud to be part of and we would want as our neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities, and owners all benefit. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : And this concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

I'm Dave Paul, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Haviv Ilan; and our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, he'll provide insight into third-quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and give an update on our capital management, as well as share the guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024. With that, let me turn it over to Haviv. Haviv Ilan : Thanks, Dave. Let me start with a quick overview of the third quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.2 billion, an increase of 9% sequentially and a decrease of 8% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 4% year-over-year and embedded processing declined 27%. Our other segment declined 5% from the year-ago quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by end-market. Our results continue to reflect the asynchronous market behavior that we've seen throughout this cycle. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down low-single digits as customers continue to reduce their inventory levels. The automotive market increased upper single digit, primarily due to strength in China. Personal Electronics grew about 30%, Enterprise Systems was up about 20%, and Communication Equipment was up about 25% as the cyclical recovery continued in these three markets. With that, let me turn it over to Rafael to review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, third-quarter revenue was $4.2 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.5 billion or 60% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit margin increased 180 basis points, primarily due to higher revenue. Operating expenses in the quarter were $920 million, about flat from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 24% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.6 billion in the quarter or 37% of revenue and was down 18% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the quarter was $1.4 billion or $1.47 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.03 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion in the quarter and $6.2 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.3 billion in the quarter and $4.8 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.5 billion. As a reminder, free cash flow includes benefits from the CHIPS Act investment tax credit, which was $220 million in third quarter and $532 million on a trailing 12 month basis. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $318 million of our stock. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 5%, marking our 21st consecutive year of dividend increases. This reflects our continued commitment to return free cash flow to our owners over time. In total, we returned $5.2 billion to our owners in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.8 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt outstanding is $14 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.8%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.3 billion, up $190 million from the prior quarter and days were 231, up two days sequentially. For the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.7 billion to $4 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.29. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be about 13% in the fourth quarter. As you're looking at 2025, based on current tax law, we would expect our effective tax rate to remain about the same. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for a follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. I guess the first question is, autos grew, I think, that was a little bit of a surprise to a lot of us. Can you talk about what's going on there? You did cite China. But did orders weaken late in the quarter at all? I mean, we saw pretty much every automaker negative pre-announced. So can you talk about maybe what you're seeing in autos and maybe if you can provide a little commentary for December what the outlook is there? Is it sort of anything you'd call out in December in terms of end markets? Haviv Ilan : Okay, Tim, let me start with that. This is Haviv. So regarding the automotive market, yes, it did grow. We said high-single digits, around between 7% and 8%. And that was really driven -- most of the growth came from our business in China. I think I've mentioned also in the second quarter, we saw strength in China and automotive drove that growth as well. It kind of recurred in the third quarter. Just to give you some high-level numbers, it grew 20% in Q2, and another 20% in Q3. I think it's not a surprise that there is momentum for EVs in China. Our content is growing there. And that's what really drove the growth in the third quarter. I expect that to, I mean that -- I think this is not the one-quarter thing. I think there is growing momentum there. Our automotive revenue in China is in an all-new-time high. So, I don't think that goes down in the near future. Now, the rest of the automotive market is different, okay? We are seeing a continued weakness over there. That revenue picked in the third quarter of 2023, and in general, trended down. If I put China aside, it had a quick correction in Q1 -- Q4 and Q1. The rest of the markets, I see a continued weakness. I think that's part of our, call it, seasonal forecast for Q4. Dave Pahl : Do you have follow-on Tim? Timothy Arcuri : I do, yes. Rafael, so if I look at the guidance, OpEx is usually, I think, down low- to mid-single-digits for December. So if you assume even down mid-singles, you get gross margin sort of in the mid-50s. It's down like 200 basis points stripping out depreciation. So that's a pretty big decline. So I guess, are you taking down loadings in December? I do see that finished goods was up a lot. So if you can talk about that. Thanks. Rafael Lizardi : Yes. So a couple of things in your question. So let me try to address them. OpEx, nothing unusual, but we do probably expect to -- expect it to be flat to slightly up. So consider that. As far as the fourth quarter, with revenue at the midpoint decreasing, that takes a hit on margins, of course. So we would expect -- we do expect gross margins to be down and also depreciation will continue to increase. And in fact, in October, we began depreciating the building and the clean room for SM1. So that continues to put -- that's going to put even more upward pressure on depreciation in fourth quarter. Dave Pahl : Thank you. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Haviv, you -- so first, thanks for providing the end-market commentary. I think you mentioned personnel electronic demand went up, I think 30% sequentially is what I recall, it was up mid-teens in Q2 also. How do we square your strength in personnel electronics with the more kind of sluggish demand that we see for PCs and phones? Is it something outside of those areas or are those areas doing better? Just what do you attribute this strength in personal electronics? Are you thinking the market just kind of bottomed from a cyclical perspective? Haviv Ilan : Yes. I think that's a great question. Let me just walk through what we've seen over the last, even couple of years. So I mean that revenue in the personal electronics market, it peaked in the third quarter of 2021. By the way, the third quarter is typically our peak quarter every year. There is a seasonality strength in every third quarter for PE. And it roughed in the first quarter of 2023. Since then, we have seen continuous improvement. But I will say, Vivek, that when I look at our third quarter of 2024, it's still running at a lower level than the peak. It's running about 20% lower than the 2021 peak. So there is still room to grow. And in our case, as I think I've mentioned in some of the calls, when we were short in with the supply capacity back in 2021, 2022, where we had to take some calls where it was to bias our supply towards industrial and automotive. The personal electronics has a shorter design cycles. We said we'll go attack that once the capacity and inventory are back in place. That's the case right now. So I think we are coming off of a very low trough, plus again having the right part to go back and win sockets that we couldn't sell before. So that's what I'm seeing right now. In terms of specifically into the third quarter, I think growth was across all the sectors or most of the sectors, the main ones are phones and notebook PCs. But in general, the third quarter, as I've said, is a typical strong quarter for PE. Dave Pahl : Do you have follow up, Vivek? Vivek Arya : Yes. Thank you, Dave. So bigger picture question, Haviv, is on in the last few calls, there has been a suggestion that perhaps by calendar 2026, TI will conceptually be closed, if not more than what you were in calendar 2022. And people have kind of rightly then pushed back and said, well, that requires mid-teens sales growth in the next two years, well above the trend line. At what point do you think you will start to see those above seasonal quarters to help us get to that above-trend growth for the next two years. So I understand you're not giving guidance, but what are you seeing in the broader end markets and do you think TI is at a point where those kind of above seasonal quarters are line-of-sight or is it too early to make that judgment? Thank you. Haviv Ilan : Yes, first, just to recap on your question, Vivek. Thanks. I think you're referring to our capital management call we had in August. So I just would ask people to look at what exactly we presented there. I think you referred to a 2026 scenario -- a set of scenarios that we've presented there from flat to growth versus 2018. And we didn't say we are predicting what revenue would be, but it allows investors to kind of have a view on free cash flow per share according to the revenue scenario. And I think it allows you guys to modulate up or down revenue and know what free cash flow will do during that year. Now more specifically to your question, look, the -- we talked about three markets that are already in the midst of a cyclical recovery. I think they are not done yet, but they are pointing in the right directions. That's Personal Electronics, Enterprise Systems and Communication System for us coming from a very low trough, but showing momentum and I think that we are in the process of strengthening. Unfortunately, these markets were about 25% of our revenue in 2023 and in our case, we really need the broad industrial market and the automotive market to join, okay. So if I go to industrial first, revenue peaked in the third quarter of 2022. We've seen eight quarters of decline. We are more than 30% down versus the peak. So I don't think we -- I hope and I can't predict it. I don't think we have a lot left, okay? I think the inventory correction is still ongoing, but I do expect that to start to recover, I cannot predict the quarter because usually when we see it, we call it. I will just say we haven't seen it yet and it's been quite persistent, okay. That's on the industrial side and I can go even into the sectors, most of the sectors are showing either still searching for a bottom or hovering at a very low level, okay. So it's about time, but we haven't seen it yet. On the automotive market, I think it's more complex because this is where we see a different story between China and the rest of the market. Unfortunately, China is about 20% of our business, so it cannot move the overall automotive number for the company. But I think as I mentioned before, we are right now at a lower-single digit versus the peak kind of hovering it at minus -- sorry, not lower-single digit, I would say upper-single digit, but somewhere between 5% to 10% versus the peak on automotive. In China, we have new records being established. I think there is momentum over there. But the other markets or the other geographies, sorry, on automotive are still searching for that bottom. I do expect when it all adds up, automotive will establish a lower peak-to-trough cycle and not close to the industrial side, but I can't give you a precise time for that, Vivek. Dave Pahl : All right. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor. Please proceed with your question. C.J. Muse: Yeas, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, bigger picture, I guess given the cyclical uncertainty, how are you thinking about kind of running utilization rates into Q4 and first half of 2025? And as part of that with inventory at $4.3 billion, are you looking to continue to grow that and elevate utilization or keep it where it is until you really see signs of that cyclical recovery, would love to hear your thoughts there? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. No, happy to do that. So first, bigger picture and then I'll get into maybe some specifics, but the objective for inventories to support revenue growth as we prepare for the upturn, as Haviv described in our expectations going forward, particularly in 2025. We do expect to grow inventory in fourth quarter. So we grew a couple of hundred million in third quarter. We expect probably a few $100 million of inventory growth again in fourth quarter. But that is, we have moderated the factory loading. So factory loadings expect us to go slightly down going into the fourth quarter, but despite that, we'll still grow additional inventory. Just to comment a little more on the inventory, we have detailed plans by device at the finished goods level, at the chips level, and those plans are grounded on purchasing behavior and expected demand and this inventory is very low-risk. It sells to many, many customers and it has a long life cycle. So we feel really good, really good about that. C.J. Muse: That's great, thanks. Dave Pahl : C.J. do you have a follow-on? C.J. Muse: I do -- I would hope to follow up on auto. You talked about that as a surprise in China. I'm curious if you could speak to Chinese OEMs taking share in Europe, that's something that we've kind of picked up and curious perhaps maybe the data points we're picking up in Europe related a little more to share loss there to some of the Chinese OEMs, are you seeing that? Rafael Lizardi : First, I know it's a surprise -- I think not a surprise because we've seen that trend starting in Q2. So to me the automotive market in China for TI, it again peaks in that end of 2023, call it, second half of 2023. We saw a very sharp correction in Q1. I think it was mainly inventory correction and then a growth in Q2, growth in Q3, it's 20% on top of 20%. So think about it running at 45% of the opening and a new pick. I think that is mainly driven by the China market, right? If you think about -- I mean, I was just there a couple of months ago, most of the new -- I think now majority of new cars are EVs, right, or some sort of hybrid and these tend to have more content. And again, our position there is good. TI is very competitive. So I think that drives growth. Now our customer base in China is a set of OEMs, but also Tier 1s. And you guys know the OEM share in \u2013 you are the experts there, but the Tier 1s are also I think are -- they are -- they can build good systems. They are very efficient in cost. Performance is pretty good. So I think they also compete for market shares versus the worldwide Tier 1s and I think that's part of the dynamics we see in the China market. We see momentum on both. C.J. Muse: Thank you. Dave Pahl : Thanks, C.J. Next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Ross Seymore : Hi guys, thanks for let me ask a question. Haviv, you talked a couple of times about China going up 20% sequentially two quarters in a row. Is there any reason that the other 80% of the business shouldn't have that sort of a cyclical rebound at some point? Is there something that's unique about China that allows it to be more volatile or is the expectation that you would have that the other 80% of your business at some point in time should do the same thing? Haviv Ilan : Yes. First, I think at some point of time, all the horses will point in the same direction and we all are waiting for that. It's been a while, but I think that happened. Again, it's a asynchronous behavior, it's so clear to us and you can see an opposite behavior between geographies, between markets. I will say that, again, as we talked about in the previous response or my previous answer, there is a stronger EV momentum in China. On top of it, I think the China call it culture, call it environment is the design cycles are quick, inventory corrections are quick. So there is a little bit of a everything is more accelerated, I would say over there and I think that's why we're seeing shorter cycles in terms of the way up, the way down, that would be my guess. But I think we'll all be able we'll be smarter only when that thing is done or played out completely. All I can say that I've not seen this played out completely on the automotive market outside of China. But I don't think -- again, I don't think the peak-to-trough on the automotive market is going to be as pronounced is industrial simply because the secular growth over there, I believe is strong to short-term. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Ross? Ross Seymore : Yes, I do. One for Rafael. On the OpEx side of things, just a conceptual question, as we look into 2025, kind of what would be the puts and takes on OpEx? And I guess the punchline is, you guys have kept OpEx in certain periods of time barely growing year-over-year. In other years, inflation has been something you guys have had to endure as well. So how do we think about OpEx kind of structurally in 2025? Rafael Lizardi : Yes. In fact, for 2025 and beyond, the way to think about it is, we continue to have a disciplined process, as you alluded to on our investments and our OpEx. But when it comes to R&D, we'll continue to invest there. So you'll see our investments grow overtime and continue to grow. Whereas in SG&A, the focus there is efficiency, so continue to drive efficiency. So there the -- it will probably grow, but at a much lower pace than R&D. And, of course, a revenue, the goal is for both of those to be under the revenue growth for the foreseeable future. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Raf. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to drill a little bit more into that China strength. So you're seeing it in auto. Are you seeing any signs of like China strength in analog or anywhere else in any other end market? Is it just completely focused on automotive at this point? And I guess what I'm getting at is, I'm trying to judge the propensity of some of the Chinese guys maybe to be buying more. We've got an election coming up. Nobody exactly knows what's going on with the general geopolitical environment. Just what do you see more broadly in China, both in and outside of auto? Haviv Ilan : Yes, Stacy. I can tell you what we see and again, I -- it's helpful to speculate beyond what we see. But in general, just a reminder, as I said, during the upcycle, we had to bias our supply into the industrial and automotive markets, okay. So clearly, the -- and I think we said the company was at about 75% in industrial and automotive in 2023. China was similar, maybe even higher because we had to take some calls on the consumer PE side. So just to know where we're starting for from. So in automotive, I think as I said before, I can't tell you the reason for that, but I think part of it is the -- I think the China customers are fast-moving. I think they are gaining momentum worldwide, not only in China. The second thing is, I think it's acceptance of EVs in China and there may be some other reasons as you have mentioned, but we have not seen a clear evidence for that, okay, of a very large inventory buildup or anything like that. That's on your direct question of automotive. On the industrial side, we have not seen China recovering from the cycle yet. So we, again, we -- it has peaked somewhere in 2022, in China, included. And since then, it had a little bit of a sequential growth in Q2, but then it went down again in Q3. So kind of hovering at the bottom. That's the way I would describe it. So we are waiting for that to happen. We have seen a very strong recovery in automotive, actually with a new high, but the industrial numbers are still trending about 40% or so, maybe even higher in China versus the peak. So a lot of work for us to do in China. I don't think -- I think it's just -- I think customers, as we said in my -- as I said in my prepared remarks, are still working through some inventory over there on the industrial side. Rafael Lizardi : And maybe just to add one thing. when you look at Stacy, the other three markets that are cyclically recovering, personal electronics, comm and entertainment, all of the regions are growing and contributing to that. Haviv Ilan : Yes, in China included, right. But again, all those are very low number, if you will, in 2023. Dave Pahl : I'm sorry. Do you have a follow-on, Stacy? Stacy Rasgon : I do. Thank you. I know you guys don't guide two quarters ahead, but just mathematically we've been sort of looking at performance versus normal seasonality. How would you guys define typical seasonality for Q1? And maybe like, what is it over the last several years and how would you define it like versus -- like pre-COVID levels? Haviv Ilan : Yes. So maybe I'll talk about Q4, Stacy. And some people -- it depends how you define seasonality. I like the way you do it. You kind of need to take the outliers away. And I think 2020 and 2021 were the outlier during the upcycle. And typically, in the fourth quarter, we see kind of a minus 7% to even sometimes close to minus 10%. Dave, the Q1 ones, can you add what\u2026 Dave Pahl : Yes. It's more -- it's usually more flat. It's more flattish, maybe down a little bit, but fourth quarter and first quarters definitely are seasonally weaker quarters. Second and third are obviously, the stronger quarters. Stacy Rasgon : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you guys. Dave Pahl : Next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Thomas O\u2019Malley: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Haviv, I just wanted to clarify some comments you made in the preamble. You kind of talked about the three markets, enterprise, PE, and comm, still correcting, but showing momentum. So not finished, but showing some progress. Are those still sequentially declining or are one or two of those actually coming off of the bottom and improving? Haviv Ilan : No, I think all three are sequentially growing in a fast pace. So I think, just to repeat the numbers, I think PE grew 30% sequentially and Enterprise grew 20% sequentially, and Comms grew 25% sequentially. My point is that they are still not at the previous peak, okay? So to me, when I think about the momentum, I think, I expect momentum to continue to build. I think we are still running below the previous peaks that were somewhere in mid-year 2022, and I expect that momentum to continue. I think also as I mentioned before, specifically for TI, these are the markets where we were, in some cases, short in the previous upcycle and it's our job to go back and address these sockets now when we have enough supply and inventory. Okay? Thomas O\u2019Malley: Thank you for clarifying. Yes. And then just broadly, kind of during the pandemic, you saw a lot of growth and I think most of your peers and yourself started being more vocal about describing both auto and industrial as double-digit growers. So as this kind of correction continues, you're seeing the strength from China in your auto business and obviously that's a part of the broader business and contributes to that double-digit growth. But looking back now and as you see the recovery, would you think any differently about the growth profiles of those two businesses? You obviously have your competitors coming up in a couple of weeks kind of going to restate their long-term CAGRs as well. Do you still see that a double-digit growth profile is the right way to look at those two businesses? Haviv Ilan : Yes. And again, the short answer is, yes, I see the same. I will say that even the current cycle on the automotive side is proving it and I think we will all see that in the short-term. And when I talk about short-term, it's five years to 10 years. I think the growth in industrial is multi-decades. I think we are on the -- in some of the, call it sectors in industrial. We're only in the very, very beginning or early innings. So I think the industrial -- and I don't know if we say double-digit, but I think TI grew 10% in the last decade 2013 to 2023. I think the market date may be a little bit lower than that, I would guess, but call it high single to maybe 10% would be a good guess. I think the automotive market for TI and also for the market grew faster. But I think it's going to be -- I don't think it's going to run multiple decades, okay? At a certain point of time, there is going to be a kind of some sort of saturation in terms of content per vehicle. I don't think we are close to that date now, specifically not in this decade. Hopefully, that helps. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Tom. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Moore : Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could help characterize industrial and I know you've talked about the various sub-segments underneath of that, but is that -- is there an inventory correction that's uniform other areas of strength and just any sense of inventory versus demand issues that are kind of dragging that business down. Haviv Ilan : Yes, Joe. A great question. I mean, I think we have more than 10 sectors, about 12 sectors in industrial and the overall, they all add up to a continuous decline since the third quarter of 2022. So it's the eighth quarter of decline. We are seeing -- most of the sectors I would characterize are -- have found the bottom, but are kind of hovering at that bottom, okay? And think about areas for us like building automation, the energy infrastructure, medical, kind of hovering at that bottom. On Factory Automation, we are seeing steel and it's a large sector for us. You can think about Factory Automation and motor drive, it's all these process and Factory Automation type of plants. We are still seeing a decline. So they have not found a bottom. And then, you see a couple of strength areas. Appliances, some people don't have it in industrial as we do. Appliances declined very early and we've seen some recovery there. And I would also add, in our case, we have power delivery, power delivery, think about it, the main market is silver, right? So that sits at the bottom of a rack. So we see growth over there. But these are the only two out of 12. So overall, weakness in the industrial market, hopefully that provides more color. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Joe? Joseph Moore : Yes, I do. That's helpful. Thank you. In terms of analog versus embedded, I know there's a that's been happening for a while that embedded has underperformed and there's a focus on kind of turning that around a narrower focus area. I wonder if you could just characterize what's different about the embedded market on a sequential basis that it's weaker? Haviv Ilan : Yes. So strategically we are very pleased with the progress we are seeing in embedded. Embedded is more think about these higher AUPs and more visibility, I would say, on design ins, it's less broad. So when we look at the progress, when we look at momentum with customers, I think it's -- we are excited about the future and they are going through a cyclical process exactly like the analog team has done, but they are kind of a year later. So again, embedded is almost 95% industrial and automotive. They've seen growth in 2023 versus the industrial business versus the analog business that declined double-digits. So they started almost a year-after analog think about kind of middle of 2023. We've seen four quarters. I think they are also looking at a seasonal quarter in Q4, but momentum there is strong and I'm excited about the future there. Joseph Moore : Okay. Thank you. Dave Pahl : We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I think earlier in the call, the question was asked that Haviv, you answered it for one or two end markets, but I'm hoping you can talk about how the pacing of orders progressed in the last couple of months? I wonder if you might have seen things accelerate to then only decelerate if there's been any sort of ups and downs that have surprised you? And then I have a follow-up, please. Haviv Ilan : Yes. I think we -- what I said about the third quarter, I think you think about it, there's not a lot of change that I see right now going into the fourth, but there is -- it's Q4, right? So there is a seasonality effect. In that sense, I don't see any change versus what we've seen in Q3. If we have -- if we would see something, I would call it out, but I cannot call out anything. Dave, you want to add anything about the order or... Dave Pahl : Yes. Order rates, I think we're behaving normally that they increased each month in the quarter, which is very typical. So we didn't see any large drop-offs or acceleration or deceleration on that front. Haviv Ilan : And Bill, maybe just to add on that, just a reminder that we have built good service levels of inventory. As Rafael mentioned, our lead times are very low, so we get a lot of business kind of real time. As it comes, people who call it turn business or so we simply don't have a ton of visibility right now and customers also, they take part only when they need it. I don't think they are building inventory. So that's the reason that we cannot provide more color beyond what they've said. William Stein : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. If I can have a follow-up. It actually dovetails with the follow-on, which is when you all have inventory your customers may not be all charged up about placing tons of backlog and when they have inventory, even more so, our checks recently have revealed that customers have more inventory than many suppliers thought, like they were not sort of really close to the end of the inventory digestion at end customers. And I wonder if you could either dispel that or provide any insight as TI sees it? Thank you. Haviv Ilan : Yes, I'll just answer in a high level and Dave, maybe you can chime in. But look, in general, we don't have visibility into our customer inventory levels. I do think, as we all know, I mean interest rates are high at the end of the year. I don't think there is a lot of desire to build inventory at our customers' shelves, especially when our inventory position is strong and that's where we want to be. We want to take that burden away from our customers to us that means level of service and we want to do it through not only the down cycle, but also the upcycle. Hence the preparation of capacity and inventory, as Rafael said, that's the game we want to play in the next up-cycle and that's what drives our capital allocation decisions. Dave, anything specific about the customer... Dave Pahl : Yes, I think the points that you made that we're essentially operating from a very healthy position on inventory. That means that customers don't have to place orders and that is keeping visibility low, but we want to be able to be ready for the upturn when it comes. Haviv Ilan : Yes, many of our lead times are well below 10 weeks today. So I mean we provide -- I call it excellent customer service and when customers need the product, we have it for him. Dave Pahl : All right. Thank you, Will. We'll go to our last caller, please. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Tore Svanberg : Yes, thank you for squeezing me in. I had a follow up question on the industrial market. Obviously, lead times are short and you have inventory. But I'm just wondering from an end-market or a sell-through perspective, is it fair to say that, that market is stabilizing? Is it getting worse, is it better? I know you called out those two segments that are perhaps starting to stabilize, but any further read on the end consumption there actually getting better or worse? Haviv Ilan : Yes. Just to repeat, Tore, thanks for the question and just repeating what I said. I think most of the sectors are hovering because we've seen like three or four quarters hovering at the same level more or less, okay. So I would say, you call it is there an inventory correction there or not? I mean, seasonality would say that industrial would grow, for example, in Q2 or Q3 and it didn't. So you can argue that there is some inventory correction at customers and that's the reason for my prepared remarks. But at least, I do believe that they have stabilized from a revenue perspective. I will say that the only -- and these are large sectors for TI. I will say that this is not done on the factory automation and motor drive, which is kind of this automation sector for TI, that was my only other color that I've added, Tore. And I don't know, Dave, anything to add here. Dave Pahl : I think that's good. Haviv Ilan : That's good. Okay. Dave Pahl : Do you have any follow-on, Tore? Tore Svanberg : Yes. Just one last question. So going back to the whole topic about visibility orders and so on and so forth. When you talk to your customers, especially some of your non Chinese customers, is there a sense that everyone is just waiting for rates to come down, getting through the US election because it does feel like there's like some sort of a CapEx cycle coming, but everyone just waiting on the sidelines. When you talk to some of your biggest industrial customers, do you get a sense that they're waiting for that or is this is more just about, hey, once a spending comes back with better rates and so on and so forth, we're sort of back to the race. Haviv Ilan : Short answer is no. I don't hear that at least. I don't think if they think that they would tell me anyhow. But what I think is important to remember and I think they value that because I hear it from the meetings I have that when they need it we have it, okay. And we are -- most of our portfolio is very diverse, long-lived and we let the customers know what -- where we have enough inventory to serve them as they needed and when they are more kind of, call it unique, and smaller part of our portfolio where the lead times are a little bit longer and we require more visibility. I think we are differentiated in that sense. Customers appreciate it. And hopefully, we can maintain that level of support through the next cycle and work on our market share and I think that is what customers expect and I think TI can outperform in that sense. Tore Svanberg : Very helpful. Thank you. Haviv Ilan : Okay. So let me wrap it up and with what we've said previously, at our core, we are engineers and technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objectives, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners, we will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing and we will be a company that we are personally proud to be proud of and would want as our neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities, and owners all benefit. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Haviv Ilan, and our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. I would like to provide some information that's important for your calendars. On Tuesday, February 4, at 10 a.m. Central Time, we will have our Capital Management call. Similar to what we've done in the past, Haviv, Rafael and I will share our approach to capital allocation and summarize our progress as we prepare for the opportunity ahead. Moving on, today, we'll provide the following updates. First, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, he will provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results, with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our end markets. Haviv will then provide the annual summary of revenue breakout by end market. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for first quarter 2025. With that, let me turn it over to Haviv. Haviv Ilan : Thanks, Dave. Let me start with a quick overview of the fourth quarter. Revenue was $4 billion, a decrease of 3% sequentially and 2% from the same quarter a year ago. Analog revenue grew 2% year-over-year after eight quarters of decline. Embedded Processing declined 18% and our Other segment grew from the year-ago quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. Our overall results reflect the performance from our two largest markets, industrial and automotive, which saw modest sequential declines. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance, as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down low-single-digits. The automotive market was down mid-single-digits. Personal electronics grew mid-single-digits. Next, enterprise systems declined low-single-digits. And lastly, communications equipment grew upper-single-digits. In addition, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market. As a percentage of revenue for 2024, industrial was 34%; automotive, 35%; personal electronics, 20%; enterprise systems, 5%; communications equipment, 4%; and other was 2%. In 2024, industrial and automotive combined made up about 70% of TI's revenue, up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our customers across all regions are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technology to make their end products more reliable, more affordable and lower in power. This drives growing chip content per application, or secular content growth, which will likely continue to drive faster growth in industrial and automotive. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael Lizardi : Thanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was $4 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.3 billion, or 58% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, higher depreciation and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 190 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $937 million, up 4% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.8 billion, or 24% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.4 billion in the quarter, or 34% of revenue, and profit was down 10% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, or $1.30 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.02 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in the quarter. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $537 million of our stock. We also increased our dividend per share by 5% in the fourth quarter, marking our 21st consecutive year of dividend increases. In total, we have returned $5.7 billion in the past 12 months to owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $7.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was $13.7 billion, with a weighted average coupon of 3.79%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.5 billion, up $231 million from the prior quarter, and days were 241, up 10 days sequentially. Now, let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2024, cash flow from operations was $6.3 billion, and capital expenditures were $4.8 billion, as expected. We are nearly 70% through a six-year elevated CapEx cycle that, once complete, will uniquely position TI to deliver dependable, low-cost 300-millimeter capacity at scale to meet customer demand. Free cash flow for 2024 was $1.5 billion, or 10% of revenue. Our free cash flow reflects the strength of our business model as well as our decisions to invest in 300-millimeter manufacturing assets and inventory to support our overall objective to maximize long-term free cash flow per share, which we believe is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.94 to $1.16. Based on current tax law, we now expect our effective tax rate for 2025 to be about 12%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Dave Pahl : Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Toshiya Hari : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. First one for Haviv. You're guiding Q1 revenue down, I think, 2% to 3% sequentially. I was hoping you could maybe provide some color by end market, what you're seeing on a sequential basis? You guys were quite helpful last quarter diving deep into automotive, what you're seeing in China, et cetera, et cetera. So, any color, any standouts to the upside or downside relative to what's typical seasonality would be very helpful. Thank you. Haviv Ilan : Okay. Thanks, Toshiya. So, again, for Q1, as you said, about 3%, I think, sequential, which is I would describe it as a seasonal decline for Q1. I will say that typically in Q1, what we do see is the personal electronics market would usually show quite a significant decline, just seasonality. And we did have a pretty decent Q4 for PE. So, I think that's what we expect there. And typically also, if you look at the markets like automotive, industrial, the decline should be less pronounced there. So, that's kind of my expectation. Nothing specific that I would add on markets. I will provide a little bit more color on Q4, especially in our two main markets, industrial and automotive. I think, again, they behave similarly like the overall company in Q4 and also similar to what we've seen in Q3, but maybe with some little bit small changes. So, if I start with the industrial market, as I described, I think, during the last call, most of the sectors that are kind of hovering at the bottom, maybe found the bottom, and then there are a couple of sectors that are still showing larger declines, especially industrial automation and the energy infrastructure market that still not found, I believe, the bottom. We'll have to see what the first half of '25 has planned for that. And on the automotive market, similar to Q3, we did see kind of a pretty significant weakness, maybe outside of China. So, it declined about mid-single-digit, about 5% sequentially, but China did grow, but not enough to offset the declines in Europe, the US and Japan, which is very -- it was kind of similar to what we've seen in Q3, but maybe the growth in China was less pronounced and decline outside of China was more pronounced. That would be my high-level summary for Q4 and a little bit for Q1. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-up, Toshiya? Toshiya Hari : I do, Dave. Thanks so much. The earnings outlook for Q1, Haviv, there's a pretty significant drop off on a sequential basis for a 2% to 3% decline in revenue. I was hoping you could kind of provide some context there. Is it primarily gross margin and behind that is it continued under loadings, increase in depreciation, some of the same dynamics we saw over the past 12 months, or is it higher OpEx, anything below the line? Any sort of additional color on sort of the drop off in EPS for Q4 to Q1, that would be helpful. Thank you. Haviv Ilan : Sure. I think I covered revenue. Rafael, maybe you cover the other part there. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, happy to. Okay. So, maybe let me start with GPM, and then I'll go to OpEx, and then I'll go to the other income line, which is relevant this time. So, on gross margins, keep in mind that depreciation is increasing, first of all. Second -- well, revenue is decreasing; that has an impact. Then, depreciation is increasing. And then, we are -- in order to manage inventory, we are reducing factory loadings. We've reduced some of that in fourth quarter, but we're going to reduce those further in first quarter. So, I do expect GPM percent to decrease probably a few hundred basis points fourth quarter to first quarter. Then, let me comment on OpEx. OpEx will increase 3% to 5% fourth to first, and that's kind of normal seasonal increases that happened in first quarter on OpEx in addition to the overall increases in investments that we're making. Beyond that, this time, it's relevant that interest income is decreasing by about $50 million. The reason that is happening is short-term interest rates are decreasing, and that's where we invest our cash. And our cash on the balance sheet, cash levels are also decreasing. So, a combination of lower interest rates and lower cash gives you a significant drop in other income. So that's -- in this case, about $50 million less fourth going to first. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Toshiya. Yeah, we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Chris Caso : Yes. Thank you. I guess first question will be with regard to the Embedded business. And we're seeing a sharp divergence there between those two businesses, particularly on the margin side. Can you give some explanation of what's going on between the Analog and the Embedded businesses, and is the reason for the decline in the Embedded margins? Haviv Ilan : So, Chris, let me just say a few words on the revenue side and I'll let Rafael talk about the margins over there. So, again, Embedded and Analog a little bit like many of the phenomena we see regarding market geographies, we are seeing asynchronous behavior between these two markets. As you remember, Embedded -- our Embedded business grew in 2023, while our Analog business in '23 declined double digits. So, we saw a later [peak] (ph), about a year later on Embedded. That's the reason we see a sharper decline in Embedded right now while Analog in Q4 actually grew. So, I think Analog is about a year maybe ahead on Embedded in terms of the cyclical behavior. Regarding profitability, Rafael, I'm sure it's related to LFAB, but you go. Rafael Lizardi : That's absolutely right. Yeah. So, the profitability, Embedded, first, is revenue. As revenue drops, that clearly has an impact on profitability. But the second part that is different than Analog is that Embedded is taking a disproportionate impact due to LFAB, the Lehi factory in Utah, because that factory, while it's going to serve both Embedded -- and it's serving both Embedded and Analog, but it disproportionately serves Embedded. And since it's underutilized right now, it takes that hit from that underutilization. The factory loading affects Embedded disproportionately. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Chris? Chris Caso : Yes, got it. That's helpful. I guess, the follow-up question would be, some update on what's going on in China right now? You had spoken about, I guess, the auto business again is stronger there. Perhaps you could talk about the rest of the business that you're seeing in China, the industrial business for example. And we know that you've been taking some actions to kind of take back some of the share that you may have lost when your lead times were longer. Could you give us an update on that, and how that may be affecting some numbers in the near term? Haviv Ilan : Sure. So, first, high level, our China business in Q4 did grow both sequentially, but also year-over-year. I think it was mid-teens or in that area for the entire China business. I think the automotive, in fact, we talked about it last quarter, we're seeing the same phenomena, meaning customers are continuing to do well. And there is a bigger share for the EV vehicle type in China, which has higher content. So, secular growth is helping us in China on the automotive side. But you also see and I think we mentioned it also in the previous calls that we had some supply limitations during the up cycle in China and the personal electronics market was one of the main markets that suffered when we were short. We are seeing this market growing in China. It grew sequentially again nicely in the Q3, but also year-over-year, that market grew significantly in China and also in the US. These are the main markets that we have our personal electronics businesses. So, overall -- again, overall, business in China right now is healthy. You asked about industrial. We haven't seen yet the start of the cyclical growth again in industrial across all of our geographies. So, China here is not an outlier. The strength is coming mainly from, I would say, automotive and from personal electronics. Dave Pahl : Yeah. Let me just add a little color. The US, China and the rest of Asia, it's really more flat, I'd describe it, sequentially. Europe and Japan were down low-double-digits. As Haviv mentioned, if you look year-on-year, you see the US and China up kind of 12%, 14% in that range, and that growth was offset overall by declines in the other regions. Haviv Ilan : Yeah. Dave Pahl : Great. Okay. Chris Caso : Thank you. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Chris. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Ross Seymore : Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I want to ask about the pricing environment in general. You didn't mention that Rafael or Haviv in any of your discussions about gross margin or the competitive environment or any of the sequential weakness. But just wondered if that has changed in any meaningful way, either Analog versus Embedded or in certain geographies. Just any update on that front will be helpful. Haviv Ilan : Yeah. In high-level, the pricing environment does not -- we've not seen any change in Q4 versus what we've seen in 2024. I think we've expected, I think, we said in the beginning of 2024 that pricing would go back to previous behavior pre-COVID, where pricing would decline low-single-digits, like for like parts per year and that's what it did in 2024 as the year ended. Of course, I think I did provide some color on revenue by market, that mix has changed, right? So, the selling price, if you will, has changed, because industrial in 2023 was 40% of revenue, it declined to 34% in 24%, and the PE market grew from 15% in 2023 to 20% in 2024 and that is a big change of mix, if you will. That's what we have seen. But the like-for-like parts has behaved as expected and I'm not expecting that to be different in 2025 and that's a comment across all geographies. Dave Pahl : You have a follow-on, Ross? Ross Seymore : Yeah, I do. A little bit of a longer-term question maybe for Haviv. Historically, the company has talked about share gains and losses in your markets being measured in basis points, I think 15 basis points, 20 basis points, 25 basis points a year, given the fragmented nature of it was kind of what you would aspire to. It can of course go down or up, I guess, for kind of [idio-reasons] (ph), supply shocks, those sorts of things. But now that you have the supply, it seems like the world has plenty of supply, is there any reason that that historical share gain pace would be any different going forward? Haviv Ilan : Again, when we talk about share down or up, I think the only way to really measure it is over the long-term. That's always been our approach. That's the way we run the company. That's the way we behave, right? So, TI, yes, there was a lot of, I would say, a shockwave almost during COVID. It was not only supply/demand mismatch, but behavior of customers and almost anxiety of needing parts. So, I think inventory was built and I think it's still playing out. I wouldn't say that this [asynchronous] (ph) behavior across markets is done. We see it still across sectors in industrial, we see it differently between geographies, we even see it internally between our Embedded business and Analog business. So, it's one of these things that, and I kind of hate to say it, but time will tell where we are. I am excited about the fact that now we have the right inventory level, the right supply to support growth. I'm encouraged about our progress in the analog market. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we did grow the Analog business from a year-over-year perspective in Q4. It was a couple of points of growth, but after about eight quarters of decline, and I think we -- I look forward to continue to grow that business, especially when you think about the longer-term. And most importantly, the secular growth in the market that we've mentioned, industrial and automotive, I'm convinced that it's there. I'm convinced that our product portfolio is improving and strengthening, and we will have the right level of capacity and inventory to support our customers. So obviously, expectation that I have for the team is that TI will continue to compete for market share and grow it. Ross Seymore : Thank you. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Ross. We'll go to next caller, please. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Danely : Hey, thanks guys. Hey, Haviv, I guess just a little bit of a drill down on the end markets. How would you expect things to sort of play out this year? Maybe talk about where you would expect relative strength or not strength by the end markets? And have you seen would you say you've seen any change in business conditions over the last three months like better, worse or not really? Haviv Ilan : Chris, as I think I told you last time we met, we call it when we see it, meaning I can tell you what happened. It's very hard for us to tell you exactly what will happen. Even for this quarter, I think I mentioned even during the last call, lead times are short, customers are coming real time for demand, and our turn business or what we call aging is running high right now simply because customers are always waiting for the last second before they make the order and we fulfill it because we do have the right level of inventory, and of course, capacity to support further growth. I will say that I think that some of the markets and we've seen it through 2024, they are already on the cyclical upturn. We saw it in PE, then enterprise, really driven by data center joint and we are seeing nice growth over there. And even communication business, I would say that I think it found the bottom. We saw it somewhere in, I think, in Q1 of '24 and grew sequentially since then and even returned to year-over-year growth in Q4. So, these three markets, I think they are on the upturn. And I don't think that I expect at least that if nothing major changes to continue into 2025. The big question for us is also 75% of our business or 70% of our business in 2024 is industrial and automotive. And here, we haven't seen the bottom yet. Let's be very clear about that. We're seeing points of strength. I've given China as an example, but we'll have to see how the year play out. I do believe that this on the industrial side that there is kind of -- as I said last time, kind of this hovering at a low level. It's a great position to grow from, but we'll just have to wait and see when it wants to do it, Chris. And of course, when we see it, we'll say it. Dave Pahl : Any following, Chris? Chris Danely : Sure. Just quickly on Embedded. So, it looks like you guys have the lowest margins there in, I think, over a decade or something like that. Does something need to be changed or restructured there to get Embedded back to an adequate level of margins? Or maybe talk about what needs to be done to get it to some sort of an appreciable level of margin? Haviv Ilan : Yeah, let me take a quick high-level answer, Chris, and Rafael will give a little bit more what's going on there. I think you're seeing a business in transition, Chris. I am getting -- I'm growing more excited about Embedded every quarter. I think, our portfolio is strengthening and we are winning business. We are going through a transition, especially on the manufacturing side, and that puts pressure on the margins. But we are convinced that strategically Embedded is going to be a great contributor to free cash flow per share. And so, the short answer to your question about restructuring or anything, the answer is no. Rafael, maybe you can provide some more color what's going on there. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. No, I'll just add similar to what I said in a few calls -- a few questions ago. One is the revenue is the main factor. As Haviv talked about earlier in the call, Embedded has seen a sharp decline because it took longer to get into the downturn than Analog did, but if you look at [pick to drop] (ph), they're about the same place, Analog and Embedded. And then, the other reason is LFAB, right? So, Embedded is taking disproportionate amount of the impact from having LFAB underutilized. But let me stress, just like that takes away, it gives it to you on the other end. So, when we ramp -- as we ramp LFAB and as we move from external to internal, you're really going to like the fall-through both to GPM, but even better to free cash flow as we do that. So, Embedded is that -- Haviv said, it's in transition. And when we're on the other side, we're going to like the results. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Chris. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. One of the metrics we look at to gauge the health of the cycle is the number of customer pushouts, cancellations, rescheduling of the backlog relative to prior quarters or maybe big changes, right, on customer forecast inside of the quarter. Has this level activity remained at kind of normalized levels? And then, maybe on another metric we look at is turns orders. And I know, Haviv, you said it's at high levels, but is that coming in about as expected as well? Haviv Ilan : Yeah, let me start with the second part of the question. I'll let Dave comment about the first part. So, look, we came in Q4 at the higher side of the range, close to the top of the range, that's all came -- that all came from, what we call the turns business. So, we didn't see that clog in the beginning of the quarter and it came in real time. So, we need to see that that continues into the beginning of next year -- of this year. Of course, there is Chinese New Year right now and we just have to see that it's not that -- it's a trend rather than anything that is a one-quarter phenomena. But the turns business looked very, very good in Q4. Dave Pahl : Yeah. And Harlan, when you look at those other indicators like you brought up cancellations, we had seen those drop several quarters ago and they continue to be at very low levels. If you look at things like revenue linearity, revenue increase through the quarter, that's very typical for us to see that. And Haviv mentioned earlier, lead times remain short. We have availability of essentially all of our products that we sell via the web available for immediate shipment. So, customers can behave and have that confidence that they can get the product that we've got. Do you have a follow-on? Harlan Sur : Yeah. Thank you. So, right before the capital management update back in August, I remember you had just received your preliminary CHIPS Act grant allocation, $1.6 billion. That number was solidified, I think, in December, and this was not contemplated in your free cash flow per share calculation. In the CHIPS Act press release, you guys articulated some of the milestones attached to those grant dollars. And it looks like actually many of those milestones are going to be executed in or before 2026. And that's $1.6 billion in grant dollars, that drives an incremental $1.75 of free cash flow per share versus sort of what you potentially laid out in your 2026 scenario analysis. So, have you mapped out that $1.6 billion in CHIPS Act grants over 2025, 2026? And maybe have an updated view on the potential better free cash flow per share profile for Texas Instruments? Rafael Lizardi : So, let me try to answer that question. First, kind of bigger picture, as you alluded to, the Department of Commerce awarded us up to $1.6 billion in CHIPS Act funding. This will help support three of our new 300-millimeter wafer fabs under construction in Texas and Utah. This direct funding, coupled with the ITC, will help us provide a geopolitically dependable supply of Analog and Embedded Processing chips for years to come. Over the life of the -- maybe the most important point is over the life of the program between the ITC and the direct funding, we expect to receive $7.5 billion to $9.5 billion in total. We've received some of that already in 2024 and expect 2025 and beyond to continue. We don't have any specific details to share at this point on the cash payments related to the direct funding, but as those happens, we will share those. Haviv Ilan : I would just add that the math is not incorrect, but the timing is the problem, right? So, I think, as you said, there is and we talked about free cash flow, so it also depends when we get the cash. We just don't have that visibility. The milestones are related, as we I think mentioned, to cleanroom construction and two installations in Sherman 1, which we are in the -- we started installing tools in the summer of '24 and that moved well. And the construction of SM2, the shell, which it's not done yet, but it's moving well. The other part is one in Utah, it's LFAB2. This is where we talk about cleanroom construction and tool installation for LFAB2. But we are now only now starting the groundwork over there, right? So, there is still quite a bit of execution in LFAB2 and we will see how that timing works as we continue to move forward on that execution. Rafael Lizardi : Let me add one more thing. Just given that we have been officially awarded a $1.6 billion we already booked that on our balance sheet. So, we have $1.6 billion receivable. You can see that on the balance sheet. The other side of that, $1 billion of that decreased our net PP and E and because that's related to a factory that's already built. $0.6 billion of that is actually deferred liability because it's related to a factory that's not built. But the bottom line where I'm going is that this is already going to decrease our expected depreciation. So, with that, let me give you an update to depreciation. Depreciation for 2025, now you should expect $1.8 billion to $2 billion; that's slightly down from the previous expectation. And for 2026, we're keeping the range the same, $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion, but I'll tell you that we expect to be on the lower half of that range. That's the 2026 depreciation expectation, $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion to be at the lower end of that range. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, Harlan. We'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question. CJ Muse : Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I know you guys are loathe to talk beyond the quarter, but I was hoping you could give us a framework for thinking about gross margins beyond the March quarter. You just gave us the depreciation. That's very helpful. Would love to hear kind of your thoughts on what's optimal inventory and therefore planned utilization beyond March. And is March quarter kind of the low for gross margins and we should start tracking higher? Any thoughts there would be very helpful. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah. No, happy to do that. It's going to be very similar to what I've said before, but it all starts with revenue. So, revenue is the number one driver of gross margin, both dollars and percent, going forward. You model your revenue, then you fold that through at 75% to 85%. And then, after you do that, then you have to adjust for depreciation increases. And I already gave you the depreciation numbers, so you can model that in the future. This works much better if you do full years and you do it over the long term rather than any given quarter. And on that, the other factor that you have is the factory loadings or underutilization. Right now, as I mentioned, we expect a hit from that in first quarter, but that just as it's a hit sometimes, it's a benefit when you go the other way. And -- but that depends on revenue expectations. So, if revenue materializes in the future and we expect that to continue, then we ramp up the factories and that helps with the loadings and that tends to take the 75% to 85% towards the high end of that range. If that doesn't happen, then you're looking at the lower end of that range. Haviv Ilan : And the last note, and I think you touched it before, Rafael, is related to our execution. So, of course, revenue, we want to grow it and definitely, we want to do it faster than the market. That's always our objective. But on the other hand, it's that LFAB execution, right? We are executing our transition from our foundry business into Lehi. I expect that to have a step forward in 2025, especially as our automotive business, we have a bunch of products that are what we call -- they have a safety effect that usually the call is a little bit more complex, it just takes a little bit longer, but we are moving well on that execution. And again my expectation from the team is to meet our commitment to our customers and get these parts out of Lehi as they prefer that dependable capacity and for us, it's a way lower cost, and of course, helps as a byproduct on the margins as well. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, CJ? CJ Muse : Yeah, just a quick one, Dave. Rafael, just to go back to kind of a loading question, if we do assume normal seasonal pattern for your top-line into Q2, Q3, should we assume that loadings would move higher in Q2? Rafael Lizardi : We forecast one quarter at a time, so I'm going to stick with that. But I'll also say, maybe as you're alluding to, the more revenue we have, then -- let me put it this way. We're not planning -- $4.5 billion of inventory is a healthy level of inventory, and we would not want to be draining those levels at this point. So, maybe that gives you enough to think about. CJ Muse : Thank you. Dave Pahl : Great. Thank you, CJ. Yeah, we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Joshua Buchalter : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, I wanted to follow-up on the previous one. You mentioned not necessarily wanting to drain the inventory levels below the $4.5 billion levels. As we think about how you're thinking about 1Q though, like is this the level you're comfortable with and you're going to manage to the $4.5 billion? And, I guess, to ask more acutely, is there a near- to medium-term inventory target on a days basis that we should be thinking about? Because I know that's obviously evolved through the last several years. I'd be curious how you're thinking about it now as we sort of are [chipping] (ph) closer to end demand. Rafael Lizardi : Yeah, first, let me give you the big picture, and then I'll give you some specifics. But big picture, inventory, the goal here, the objective is to maintain high levels of customer service while we minimize the obsolescence of inventory. We have target levels at the finished goods, at the chip level for the 80,000 parts that we sell in different end markets, and that is done in a very rigorous and disciplined way on a part by part basis. So that's how we look at it. And the risk of obsolescence on this part is very, very low. This part lasts for a long time. They sell to many, many customers for many, many years in very long life cycles. Now, to the specific that you have, given how we're running the factories right now, I would expect a further increase of inventory levels going into first quarter, but probably in the $100 million, $100 million-plus level, and then potentially stabilize at that point around that level. Dave Pahl : Do you have a follow-on, Josh? Joshua Buchalter : Yeah, thank you for the color, Rafael. Yeah, to follow-up, I wanted to ask about, there were some earlier questions about competition, specifically in pricing. I guess, I wanted to ask bigger picture, not necessarily pricing related, but as some of your peers have sort of gotten through and lapped and are no longer shipping to [NCRS or LTSAs] (ph), have you noticed a change in the competitive backdrop on the number of sockets that are open for competition? I'd be curious to hear about if there's any change competitively over the last couple of quarters. Thank you. Haviv Ilan : Yeah. I haven't seen a significant change. It feels the same to me, kind of stable. I mean, it's -- we are in a down cycle and I remember throughout my career, every time there is a down cycle, the market gets more competitive and it's still the same now. And that's again across all markets, all geographies, but I haven't seen any significant change in the last couple of quarters to your direct question. Dave Pahl : Thank you, Josh. And we've got time for one last caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Thomas O'Malley: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. This is for Haviv or Rafael. Just at the Capital Management Day, you guys highlighted different CapEx ranges depending on kind of different revenue CAGRs. And I know the intention there wasn't to guide revenue, but you just updated us on depreciation in response to just the ITC and some of the grants as well. Is the depreciation being at the lower end entirely a function or the updated guide that you're giving today entirely a function of those tax credits and grants, or is that a function of potentially lower CapEx as well? Rafael Lizardi : It is not a function of lower CapEx. We continue to expect CapEx for 2025 to be $5 billion. And in 2026, as we said at the last call, between $2 billion to $5 billion depending on further expectations, and we'll have more clarity on that in the second half of the year. Haviv Ilan : Yeah. And again, I will add, this is not -- I mean, as we said in August, our plan is still -- we like the plan. We're going to be very disciplined executing it. We always look at the environment and what's going on, but based on what I see right now, you shouldn't expect the plan to change in terms of our Phase 1, Phase 2 as I described. Phase 1 is serving us very well. This is how we move revenue from external foundries into our LFAB factory in Utah. And also, on the analog side, we want most of our parts running on 300 rather than, for example, 6-inches fab that we are shutting down, and that's going well. The Phase 2 is very important for our future. So, we are going to complete the qualification line in Sherman 1, we are going to set the shell or build the shell in Sherman 2, and also build the shell in Lehi, so it can give us this flexible capacity phase that we are so excited about and so are the customers. Once they engage with us, they fully understand that not only they will have enough cleanroom capacity to grow into, but also the qualification is going to be behind them. So, the parts are already running, for example, in Sherman or in Lehi and that gives them a very, very easy path to grow their business with us without having to go through a recall and new fabs or new suppliers. So, I think that then serves our customers well, and we will continue to execute to it. And as you said, the slides in August and I will probably see a very similar story in a couple of weeks is that we want to say that we have a plan, but we do always have flexibility into the plan, especially in 2026 and 2027. Dave Pahl : Great. Tom, you got a follow-up? Thomas O'Malley: I do. Thanks for all the detail there. Last one of the call, so broader, and hate to end it on this, but I just wanted to give you a chance to respond. So, article is out on a China statement talking about dumping product in that market. I think there's an ongoing debate just around the sustainability of China longer-term. I guess part of this question is, can you just address what you've seen in the public there? And then, kind of as a derivative of that, you're obviously growing year-over-year in China. You're seeing strength in China auto. You highlighted that. But outside of that, are you seeing any change in the dynamic there in terms of your ability to [ship] (ph) product competition, just addressing the whole debate? Thank you. Haviv Ilan : Yeah. And again, I'll probably not settle the debate. I'll just tell you what we see and I'll start with the high level on China. It's an important market. China represents 20% more or less of world GDP and you want to play in that market. By the way, our business in 2024 in China was at about 20%. So, we are kind of not over or under penetrated in China, it's kind of just right at 20%. And our commitment is to our customers. Our customers in China, they rely on our parts, they want to have the best products, they want to have the highest quality, they want to get best service, and TI is a good supplier. And on top of it, their ambition is to be global players, right? So, maybe, they are part of the headquarters in China, but they want to sell their end equipment to any geography. And in that sense, TI is a great supplier because we are a global player. We have a diverse footprint of manufacturing and support structure, and that's a great fit for their needs. Now, as you know and I think this is not news, the China end market has always been competitive and is continuing to be. We know that they are very capable, motivated, fast moving competition, but I think the competitive advantages of TI allows us to compete whether it's our broad portfolio, the reach of the channel and also our position in industrial and automotive customers value that and want to continue to do business with TI and we want to compete and that's really the fact that we own our manufacturing, own our technology. I think we have the right cost structure to compete across our entire portfolio, whether it's low AUP general purpose parts or very integrated sophisticated ASSPs that are tailored for a specific application. We don't need to sub select. We want to compete across our portfolio and our customers there appreciate that and I continue to see that. Specifically to your question, at this time, we haven't been notified about an investigation and it's kind of business as usual between us and our customers in China. Dave Pahl : That's great. Thank you. Thank you for asking that question, Tom. And thank you everyone else for joining us tonight. We look forward to sharing our Capital Management call on Tuesday, February 4 at 10 a.m. Central Time. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website. Good evening. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
