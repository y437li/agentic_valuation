Thank you for participating in today's conference, which is being recorded by Conference America. No other recordings or rebroadcast of this session are allowed without the company's permission.  It is now my pleasure to turn the conference call over to Ms. Mary Winn Gordon, Dollar General's Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. You may begin. Mary Winn Gordon : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for questions.

This information is not a substitute for any GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. As we shared with you at the time of our fourth quarter conference call, we expected the first quarter of 2013 to be our most difficult quarter, given the well-publicized tough weather comps, payroll tax increases and sales headwinds from the tax refund delays. With the first quarter behind us, we've updated our outlook to reflect the revised sales estimate and gross margin compression. The continued mix shift within consumables to lower-margin items without the benefit of sales of higher-margin non-consumables and higher inventory shrink are the key drivers of our gross margin performance. This revised view of sales and gross margin has tempered the high end of our earnings outlook. I still believe our sales ramp will come later in the year as we look forward to same -- sales growth of 4% to 5% for 2013, and we continue to have long-term opportunities for growth.  David will provide more details on our financial results in a moment, but I wanted to share just a few highlights from the quarter. Our total sales increased 8.5% over last year to a record $4.2 billion. Same-store sales grew 2.6%, with both traffic and average ticket increasing for the 21st consecutive quarter. They characterize the shape of the quarter with a U shape, with February and the back half of April sales much stronger than March as we felt the most significant weather impact, and we were lapping a double-digit comp increase in that month.  Adjusted operating profit increased 3% to $396 million, or 9.4% of sales. And adjusted net income increased 8% to $232 million. Adjusted earnings -- EPS increased 13% to $0.71 per share. For the quarter, sales growth was healthy across our consumable categories. It's my belief that the best way to judge the health of a retailer for this quarter is based on the strength of his core business. For us, that would be our consumable business, and we delivered a strong same-store sales improvement in this category. However, our non-consumable or discretionary categories were soft during the quarter as sales of seasonal merchandise and apparel were impacted by the weather. Given the positive trends we experienced in non-consumables in 2012, it's noteworthy that every non-consumable category had a negative comp in the first quarter. Even so, we're pleased with the sell-through of our holiday seasonal merchandise, including Valentine's Day and Easter. While we expected spring and summer seasonal sales to be soft given the cooler weather patterns over the quarter compared to a near-perfect weather in the prior year, we had expected total discretionary sales to recover more significantly than they did in April and, quite honestly, at a faster pace. Although our consumable categories did pick up nicely in April, we did not see a similar recovery in our discretionary categories.  Like other retail CEOs you have heard from this quarter, I don't like to talk about the weather, but the impact on our business. However, we believe it was a factor in our discretionary business. Overall, when the weather improved across the region, we saw a positive impact with improved sales. For example, it's been easier to be a district manager in Texas or Florida, where we have had better weather, as compared to the Northeast and the Midwest, where the weather has not been in our favor.  I'll talk more about our operating initiatives in the moment, but now I'd like to turn the call over to David. David Tehle : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick covered the highlights of our first quarter sales performance, so I'll start with gross profit. Gross profit dollars increased 5% for the quarter, with an 89-basis-point decrease in gross profit rate to 30.6% of sales. This decrease was driven by higher markdowns, higher consumable mix, an increase in inventory shrink and lower initial markups. You will recall that we had forecasted a gross margin decline and called it out on our last earnings call.  While our total shrink units per store continued to decrease, our financial shrink increased due to the increased loss of SKUs greater than $5 at retail. While these high-value items are generating greater shrink, they are also driving increased sales and higher-margin dollars. We're now forecasting that this negative shrink trend will not turn around in 2013. These negative margin impacts were partially offset by a benefit from transportation efficiencies driven by lower stem miles and modestly lower fuel rates.  SG&A expense was 21.3% of sales in the 2013 period compared to 21.6% in the 2012 period, an improvement of 37 basis points. Decreases in incentive compensation, workers compensation and general liability expenses contributed to the overall decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales. We were also able to leverage our retail labor expense, partially due to ongoing benefits from our workforce management system and other operating efficiencies. Our mining for cost reduction program also contributed to the overall decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales. Costs that increased at a higher rate than our increase in sales include rent expense, advertising costs, depreciation and amortization and utilities expense. The team did a nice job leveraging SG&A on a sales comp of 2.6%, which is better than our goal of leveraging SG&A on a 3% to 3.5% comp increase.  As of May 3, total inventories were $2.41 billion, up about 14% on a per-store basis. This rate of growth should moderate as we move through the year. Our inventory turns were 5.0x. The quality and aging of our inventory continues to be in good shape.  Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $150 million, including $30 million related to new leased stores; $25 million for stores we purchased or built; $74 million for upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $14 million for distribution and transportation; and $6 million for information system upgrades. During the quarter, we opened 165 new stores and relocated or remodeled 207 stores.  At the end of the quarter, we had outstanding long-term obligations of $2.84 billion, essentially in line with the prior year. We continued to improve our capital structure to ensure long-term flexibility, ample liquidity and enhanced financial performance. In March, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating to Baa3. This upgrade completed our transition to investment grade as our S&P corporate rating was already BBB-.  During the quarter, we successfully issued $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $400 million of 5-year notes at an interest rate of 1.875% and $900 million of 10-year notes at an interest rate of 3.25%. We concurrently entered into a new 5-year senior unsecured credit facility, which includes a $1 billion term loan and an $850 million revolver. Proceeds from the offerings, together with the term loan borrowings under the new credit facility, were used to repay the senior secured credit facilities. This successful refinancing allowed us to extend our average debt maturity and move to an unsecured debt structure at very attractive borrowing rates.  Now to guidance. Based on our first quarter results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we now expect total sales for the year to increase 10% to 11%. Same-store sales are expected to increase 4% to 5%. We are forecasting gross margin contraction for the full year to be in line with the first quarter due to the continued mix shift within consumables to lower-margin items, higher inventory shrink and softer sales in non-consumables.  As you model gross margin, please keep in mind we had our best performance on gross margin in fourth quarter of 2012. This will be our most challenging quarterly overlap on gross margin for the year as you look at the quarterly spread.  Operating profit for 2013 is expected to be in the range of $1.73 billion to $1.77 billion. Given our successful refinancing during the quarter, we now expect interest expense to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the year is now forecast to be $3.15 to $3.22 based on about 326 million weighted average diluted shares. This share count assumes about $500 million for total share repurchases. For the second quarter, please keep in mind that we will be lapping a $0.04-per-share impact from a discrete tax item from last year that we do not expect to reoccur this year. The full year 2013 effective tax rate is expected to be about 38%.  For the year, we plan to open approximately 635 new stores and to remodel or relocate a total of approximately 550 stores. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million.  It is still very early in the year, and the outlook for the rest of the year is very hard to call. The new guidance reflects our best estimates given what we know today. Looking at the balance of the year, I believe we have clear operating priorities in place to help us deliver on our goals.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, David. The first quarter was an extremely busy and productive one at Dollar General. I'll give you a few examples of the tremendous work that has been accomplished in just one quarter.  First, store growth. Through the first quarter, we opened 165 stores, including 10 Dollar General Markets and 8 Dollar General Plus formats. Compared to the past couple of years, our store pipeline is very robust, and we are ahead of where we were at this time last year for both new stores opened and store weeks. Our new stores are continuing to deliver strong performance that is exceeding our plans. In addition, we remodeled or relocated 207 stores in the quarter, including 44 Dollar General Plus stores. The DG Plus format is a great tool for relocations, and we were driving higher baskets given the expanded perishable assortment in those stores. At the end of the first quarter, we had 10,662 stores in 40 states, well on our way to our next milestone of 11,000 stores. Turning to store operations. We made great progress in implementing Phase 5, our initiative aimed at optimizing shelf space in 3,000 legacy stores that have not been remodeled to our customer-centric format. For the quarter, we completed the fixturing and reconfiguration of 2,800 of the 3,000 stores in this legacy group. While it's early, we are pleased with the comp sales lift of about 100 basis points we are seeing as our customers realize we expanded our product assortment.  Additionally, across the rest of the store base, the implementation of new planograms increased over 30% year-over-year as we advance the timing of our planogram changes into the first quarter of this year to better align with our category management plans and new product introductions. Specifically, we made over 600,000 planogram changes across our store base in the first quarter. All in all, this is substantial work at the store level that should provide a real benefit going forward.  We're very pleased with the results of our cooler expansions for perishable items. Most of our new stores are being built with 16 cooler doors, and we plan to increase the number of coolers in approximately 1,700 existing stores. In the first quarter alone, we installed about 6,300 cooler doors in over 1,400 of those stores, or about 80% of our target. We're also making progress on installing defensive merchandising fixtures to help us reestablish our trend of shrink improvement. In hindsight, over the last year or so, we introduced some new products with a higher dollar value per unit and did not implement the associated defensive fixturing or labeling that we now realize is necessary in select stores. During the quarter, we accelerated the installation of the fixtures, installing them in over 2,600 stores. We also completed additional shrink training workshops for all of our field management.  At the store level, the most significant initiative implemented has been our aggressive roll out of tobacco products. We are on track to have tobacco rolled out to essentially all of our stores before the end of the second quarter. As of today, we have tobacco in about 10,000 stores, which is quite an achievement when you consider the amount of work involved. For each and every store location, we have to get a license, develop a planogram, source fixturing for the product, schedule and complete the installation of the fixture, ship inventory, set the planogram and training employees. In addition, we have reconfigured the front end of the store to facilitate the sale of tobacco, including the addition of more impulse items. Much like raising of the shelf height profile to 78 inches, this effort has been a great example of success -- successful cross-functional execution at Dollar General. We continue to gain insights into the tobacco category and how we think it will contribute to traffic and sales over time. So far, as we look at tobacco purchases, we are seeing about 1/3 with tobacco only, and the remaining 2/3 are tobacco plus one or more items. The average basket with tobacco and additional items is currently above $17, and our sales and traffic are building each week along with our customer awareness. Based on our experience, we expect that the percentage of baskets with tobacco will continue to ramp up over the next several months.  In summary, we accomplished much in the quarter that we believe should pay dividends as the year progresses. While it's still early, the second quarter is off to a solid start, and we are beginning to see a slight improvement in our non-consumable sales. However, the current expected growth rate for total comps and gross margin performance for the year is not where we had projected it when we last spoke. As a result, we have moderated our outlook for the year.  It is definitely clear that as we look at our business, our customers' dependence on Dollar General's Every Day Low Pricing on basic items in our convenient format has never been greater. We are focused on meeting those needs as our customers continue to manage their way through the ongoing financial pressures they face, as they always do and they always have done. At the same time, we are continuing improving our operations across the board and believe we have a long runway for continued success.  Before I open it up for questions, I want to thank over 95,000 Dollar General employees for the hard work that was completed in the first quarter. My sincere thanks go out to all Dollar General employees for their extra -- extra efforts in this quarter.  Now we'll open up for questions, Mary Winn. Mary Winn Gordon : Okay. Operator, we'll take our first question, please. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, our first question will come from Meredith Adler, Barclays. Meredith Adler : I'd like to focus on the gross margin. I think that's probably everybody's concern. And I understand what you've said, but you are -- seem to be making an assumption that the rest of the year stays very similar to the first quarter. And maybe you could just talk more about what you believe is in the consumer's mind. If weather gets better, why wouldn't we see discretionary sales start to pick up? So maybe just talk to -- and then a little bit more about shrink and how quickly can you make improvements. Richard Dreiling : Yes. Fair, fair question, Meredith. What I'm looking at right now is, literally, where we stand today, having looked back on the quarter and thinking about how things are going. We have said for a period of time that the non-consumable side of the business is going to need just a little bit of help from the economy, I believe. We made some solid progress in 2012, but as I look across 2000 -- the first quarter of 2013, when we came out of that trough in March, I had anticipated that the non-consumable side would accelerate at a faster pace as we move through April. And we didn't see that, albeit we are seeing it improve as we are moving through May and June, but still not at the rate that I thought it would at this stage of the game. The other thing I want to talk a little bit on the margin side, why there's still opportunities in warehouse and transportation and category management and sourcing, I want to talk a little bit about what I think has happened in our quest to be a little more relevant to the customer out there. As we moved through the back part of last year and into the first part of this year, we began to expand our SKU base to include more and more national brand items, and those national brand items historically carry a little bit lower margin than our private brands, and we began to give the customer more alternatives to our private brand offering. We historically have been about good and best, or good and better when you look at our product assortment. And now, we're a little bit more good, better and best, having given more alternatives to the consumer. And let me give you a perfect example here. Six months ago, we carried the private brand version of Claritin in a 12-count, a 24-count and a 36-count, and we only carried Claritin in the 24. So if you wanted less than 24, you bought our private brands. And if you wanted more, you bought our private brands. Now we have -- the customer has their option across all 6 SKUs. And we inadvertently, in our zest to be a little more relevant, allowed the customer to be able to trade down on the margin on the -- in the consumable side of the business. I think the other thing, in our quest to be a little more relevant, we've added more high-value SKUs. And while they're selling, they're putting a little more pressure on the shrink side of the ledger, and that's this idea that while units are down, our shrink is up. So I think that we've made a lot of progress. I think, as I look at the margin we move through the year, we're going to continue to tweak that, and I think it's going to take us a couple -- 3 quarters to get -- to make that rebound. Meredith Adler : Okay. And then maybe, is there any reason -- as we think about the discretionary part of the business, do you need to cut any orders? Have you done that? Richard Dreiling : Yes. We actually -- much like a lot of the other major retailers out there, we have been looking down the road on this for 6 or 7 months. And our inventory on the non-consumable side is very healthy. It's not like we have an issue there that's going to sneak up on us. Meredith Adler : Okay, that's good to hear. And the promotional environment, is that contributing in any way? Richard Dreiling : Another very fair question. I think the competitive environment, like the last quarter, is relatively stable. I think very much like the last quarter, I think share of voice, people are competing for. There's more radio out there and more TV out there, more pages and ads, but the pricing in all of those vehicles is very rational right now. Meredith Adler : And I just had one more question. You've got obviously aggressive square footage growth plans. Given everything you're seeing, is there any reason to believe that the ROIC on new stores, over more than a couple months, but the long-term ROIC is changing at all? Richard Dreiling : We are as excited about the returns on our new stores. The speed at which they ramp up, Meredith, as I was 5 years ago when I first talked to you about it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Deborah Weinswig, Citigroup. Deborah Weinswig : Rick, is there any reason to think that you're at peak margins? Richard Dreiling : I think that we still have lots of room in lots of different areas. David, I think as we tweak what's going on in the stores in terms of the SKU base, I think that's opportunity. David, I think in terms of private brands and... David Tehle : Yes, I think you look at category management, sourcing, private brands, distribution, transportation and now, ironically, with a bigger opportunity in shrink because it's going a little bit the wrong way. So I think short-term, clearly, as we look at 2013, we don't see ourselves going up in margin, and we've put that into our guidance. But as we look out over the next 5 years, absolutely, we still believe there's opportunity to expand our operating margins. Richard Dreiling : I do think, Deb, the low-hanging fruit is gone. I think as we move through the next few years, it's going to -- we're going to have to be a little more thoughtful, a little more precise on how we get it. But I think the opportunities are still there. Deborah Weinswig : And then do you think that there's anything structural here, either with the company, the consumer or the competition? Richard Dreiling : I think the competitive environment is very stable. Like I said, it's not like we're picking up -- coming to work one day and someone's got great big ad. I think there's more pages, more radio as people are trying to make sure that consumers are there. In terms of the macroenvironment, I think the pressure that exists on customers is universe-ed across all of retailing. I think there's -- we talk about -- there's a lot more people who have an income under $50,000 a year than those that have an income of over $100,000. And I think the environment, while the governmental regulation -- there's not as much noise as there was a couple of quarters ago, and I actually feel better about the environment that our customer is in. We went through the Memorial Day weekend without a big spike in gasoline prices. I think that's a very positive thing for us. And I think structurally, in terms of the business, I tell you, I feel as good about Dollar General today as I've felt in a long time. We got a lot of work done in the first quarter. And I think it's fair to say that maybe we might even have bit off a little more than we could have chewed -- should have chewed in the first quarter. But we are -- as my chief merchant is fond of saying, our guns are loaded. And we're looking really, really, really hard at 2, 3 and 4. Deborah Weinswig : Okay. And then maybe a question you can answer, maybe you can't, but can you talk about what trends are like now? Richard Dreiling : Our -- where we stand as of this morning is smack dab middle of the range that we've given you, the guidance range. Operator : Next question, Paul Trussell, Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : So within -- Rick, within your guidance, has the sales contribution or margin impact from tobacco changed at all from a few months ago? And can you just speak to how satisfied you are with what you've seen to date? Richard Dreiling : Paul, that's a very fair question. It's too soon yet. While I've got the cigarettes installed in 10,000 stores, we haven't really reached the stage of the game where I'm selling them there yet. I'll give you some update on where we are in the margin on cigarettes as we get through the next quarterly call. But right now, there's no reason to think that there's any -- anything out of the ordinary. Paul Trussell : Okay, understood. And then when it comes to apparel and home, is your customer simply not purchasing those goods today because their wallets are tight? Or do you think that the customer has perhaps gone to purchase those goods elsewhere because of the assortment that you have within your stores, or just not wanting to shop your channel anymore for those goods, given that you're their destination for consumables? Richard Dreiling : That's a very fair question. My view on it would be -- is their wallet tight?  I think that -- when I look at our home or I look at our apparel, I think it's fair to say we have incredibly good days. And you'll have it for 2 or 3 days, and then it'll swing the other way. And I think what's going on is our consumer is finally realizing that the work that we've done on home and apparel, that we're giving them a pretty quality product at a fabulous everyday low price. And I've said for a period of time, we're going to have to sell them that that's good quality stuff, and it's taking a little bit longer than we thought. And I think you couple that, if we could get a little help from the economy and -- I think we could get that business performing at a little bit better level. I will say this, Paul, and I've said this for a long period of time and people get tired of hearing about it : we need to keep that side of the ledger. We like that side of the ledger. Obviously, there will be tweaks to it down the road, but we really like the non-consumable business, and we think we need it overall for the margin. Paul Trussell : So is there -- just to follow-up on that comment, is there any change at all to how you're thinking about space allocation in new stores or remodels when it comes to home and apparel? Or do you feel like the current space allocated is appropriate? Richard Dreiling : Our new stores are actually -- we're still pretty bullish on the home side, but our new stores are rolling out with an adjustment to the commitment in apparel. That is correct. And we have done that through all of 2012 and into '13. Paul Trussell : That's an adjustment down? Richard Dreiling : Correct. Yes. Paul Trussell : And then just -- with that comment, though, if you are adjusting the allocation of discretionary goods down, wouldn't that perhaps signal continued unfavorable mix shift? Richard Dreiling : Actually, number one, we don't want to confuse adjusting apparel with adjusting all of non-consumables. The apparel -- particularly when I talk of apparel, I'm talking about hanging apparel. We have a solid undergarment business, a solid sock business. And I think as you look at -- what we're working on is not adjusting the sales down, doing a better job of managing our sell-through. That's what we're trying to do, is maximize the margin out of those items. Mary Winn Gordon : And Paul, that business that Rick is talking about is only about 2% of our total when he talks about hanging apparels. And do keep that in mind. Operator : Our next question will come from John Heinbockel, Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So when you look at the shrink over $5, is that more discretionary? Or is that HBA, OTC, or other consumables? Richard Dreiling : I would call it discretionary inside the HBA category. So think in terms of a high-dollar eyeliner. John Heinbockel : So there should be -- in importing employees, fixturing to curtail that, is there a plan to do that? I would think that's something that could be done relatively quickly. Richard Dreiling : Yes. As I've said, we've already got 2,600 stores installed. And you have to install them, then you have to go through the shrink cycle to see what happens. And I'm very pleased with the progress we've made on that particular effort. John Heinbockel : So when you think about shrink opportunity, do you think it's more than 50 bps? Or not that much? Richard Dreiling : I would rather not get into that. I will tell you this : as hard as we're working on shrink, the number is still better than it was in 2007 when we started our initiative. So there's -- but I will say there's room for improvement. John Heinbockel : All right. And 2 last things. With tobacco, are you -- as I recall, there was not a lot of incremental labor. And as you put -- put that in the store. Is that right? Richard Dreiling : That is correct. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then secondly, do you think discretion -- or you talked about improvement, you think discretionary could be or should be positive for the second quarter? Or it won't improve that much? Richard Dreiling : I don't want to really get into that. But I will tell you, it is improving. All right? And again, you've got to remember, I'm not -- I don't want to -- all I can look at is where I am today. And like I said, it is improving. John Heinbockel : Right. Because you would think that there is pent-up demand here as weather gets better in the northern part of the country, right, that there'd be a 4- or 5-week period where people would buy all of their spring stuff all at once. Richard Dreiling : Absolutely. John Heinbockel : And that's yet to come. We haven't seen that yet? Richard Dreiling : That's correct. Operator : Next question, David Mann, Johnson Rice. David Mann : When you look at your performance of discretionary in some of those markets like Florida and Texas, can you just give us a sense on how it performed by -- in the different markets? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I would tell you, the warmer market that haven't been impacted by the weather, our discretionary sales, particularly spring and summer, are just fine. David Mann : Okay, great. And then for David Tehle, would you -- when we're looking at the -- your SG&A assumptions that are implicit within guidance, are they a little bit tighter than what you gave us a couple of months ago? And if so, what's going on there? David Tehle : No. I think we're pretty close to what we had talked about before. We always saw ourselves in our guidance leveraging SG&A to the prior year. I will say, in first quarter, we were very impressed with that 37 basis points on a 2.6 comp, as that was beyond -- generally, we guide to a 3 to 3.5 comp. But we definitely have leverage planned in our guidance on SG&A through the back half of the year. But again, I don't think there's anything too unusual about it. Operator : Our next question will come from Colin McGranahan, Bernstein. Colin McGranahan : Why don't we go back and focus on gross margin for a second. First, I think it's the first time that we've kind of maybe gotten a little more understanding of what you're doing with the assortment toward national brands. How do you rectify that problem? Are you going to be taking SKUs out, or adding additional private-label SKUs to try to get the mix shifting back a little bit? Richard Dreiling : Yes. Actually, I think the answer to that is yes to both. We are going to further expand our private brand presence again this year as we have in the past. But Colin, to be honest with you, we're going to rationalize some of the SKUs that we've put in. And the merchants have a plan to sell it down versus -- it's good merchandise here, and we feel that we can adjust that assortment and tighten it up as we move through the fourth quarter. Colin McGranahan : And how do you think that impacts the relevance? Obviously, at the time, the strategy to add it was a sales-relevant strategy. So as you start -- I don't want to use, \"unwind,\" but as you kind of self-correct a little bit here, how does that impact your outlook for relevance and comp sales? Richard Dreiling : That's a very fair question, and I do prefer the word \"adjust\" versus even \"unwind.\" Okay? Just adjusted. You got to remember, what we're talking about here is not eliminating the brand. It's eliminating sizes that give the customer a choice. So you're still going to be irrelevant in that you're going to have the national brands, we just don't want to offer as many alternatives in terms of size. That's all. Colin McGranahan : Okay. That's fair. And then just trying to get my head around the rest of the year being gross margins down 80, 90 basis points.  Can you give us any rank ordering or quantification of the various factors there between mix, tobacco impact, shrink and markdowns? David Tehle : I think if you look at it and you're trying to compare it to where -- last year versus this year on those items, tobacco is the largest one, again, compared to last year. I'm not talking about how we updated our guidance, I'm just talking about raw numbers last year versus this year. Mix would be the second one, and again, that would be the mix within consumables, as we've mentioned, going to some lower sales more in the lower-margin consumables. And then the discretionary, the non-consumable being less, the mix piece that that makes up. And then the last factor would be shrink. Colin McGranahan : Okay. That's super helpful. And David, while I have you, I'll sneak one last question in. Just in terms of capital returned, obviously, a pretty light quarter from repo. Sounds like you're still committed to $500 million for the year. What drove the decision not to buy back more stock in Q1? And how do you think about a dividend at this point? David Tehle : Yes. We -- again, in terms of our capital allocation, we remain committed to investing in the business. It's our #1 priority, opening stores. And again, we reiterated the 635 store openings as our guidance for 2013. We'll invest in the infrastructure to support that store growth because we are a growth story. And then stock buy back is, of course, our next usage of cash. We became investment grade, as you know, relatively recently with Moody's. We already were with S&P. It takes about a 3.0 debt-to-EBITDAR ratio, somewhere in that vicinity, in terms of maintaining that investment-grade rating. That's very important to us. So really, if you look at the quarter, the $20 million of stock that we brought back was pretty much in line with staying at that 3.0 on the debt to EBITDAR. Operator : Next question will come from Greg Hessler, Bank of America. Gregory Hessler : So I think you actually answered my question with the last one. But just to confirm, you guys are still committed to the 3x lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target? David Tehle : Yes. I think as we look at our business long term, clearly, being investment grade is important to us. And that 3.0 is what drives that. Now I will say, on our last call, we mentioned that if there are circumstances in the debt or equity markets, changes that we deem it'd be prudent for us to temporarily increase or decrease our debt levels, we may do so. And I just want to reiterate that. Again, that was in on our last conference call. But clearly, on a long-term basis, we are targeting investment grade and targeting net debt to EBITDAR of 3.0. Gregory Hessler : And if you temporarily increased it, would the goal still be to maintain the investment-grade rating? David Tehle : Yes. Gregory Hessler : Okay. And then last question from me, just in terms of working capital for the quarter, AP was a decent drain. Can you just kind of walk through that and what your expectations are for working capital for the rest of the year? David Tehle : Well, we don't give guidance on working capital. But I can talk a little bit about what happened in the quarter, particularly on accounts payable. A chunk of that was related to tobacco. We had a lot of receipts come in in tobacco, as I'm sure you're aware, as we are stocking stores. And the terms on tobacco are very, very, very, quick in terms of how you have to pay it. And so that was probably the biggest thing. And then we had a few more perishables come in, beer and wine, things of that nature. And again, those tend to be items that have quick payment terms. I think that was probably the biggest issue in the quarter, with tobacco being the biggest single issue. Operator : Our next question will come from Edward Kelly, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : Rick, can we just quickly just go back to the gross margin? I guess, as we think about your initial expectation going into the year of it being up, x tobacco, now it's down, could you just maybe sort of -- I know we could've gone through this a few ways, but just rank what's the biggest issue that has changed your expectation. And then for the rest of the year, why wouldn't the gross margin get better? Because other than tobacco, which I know is an increased headwind, it feels like some of these other items, like discretionary getting a little bit better, easier comparisons, shrinkage should, I would think, be able to work. So why wouldn't Q1 really be the low point and then improve from here? David Tehle : Yes. Let me take a shot at that. Again, as we look at our guidance for the year, the biggest factors -- now we're talking of the change in terms of what changed from the last guidance, different from comparing to last year that we talked about previously, if you talk abut the change, clearly, the mix issue is the biggest issue we're looking at, the mix of sales to consumable and then the mix within the consumables category to the lower-margin items. And it's just the way we're calling it. To answer your question, for the rest of the year in terms of what we're looking at, we're seeing -- we see that skewing differently than when we did our guidance previously in March. And then additionally, we mentioned shrink, and shrink is planned to be worse for the rest of year. And again, that's a new development that we didn't have when we did our guidance in March. We actually thought we'd see improvement in shrink if we got to the end of the year. And we don't see that anymore. And unfortunately, the way shrink works -- a lot of things we're doing that will clearly help us, but the probability of those impacting this year is pretty remote. That's probably going to be more likely to impact 2014. Edward Kelly : Okay. And as we think about the gross margin beyond a lot of the noise, which is taking place this year with the roll out of tobacco and stuff, is this the line item that you think you can keep fairly stable over the next few years? Mary Winn Gordon : Ed, you just said margins could be stable? Edward Kelly : Yes. The gross margin. Do think this is an item that, longer term, you can keep relatively stable beyond this year? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I mean, I think -- I mean, you're asking me to look pretty far out here, and you have to take into account the competitive situation, the environment you're in. But, Ed, I do fall back to -- I believe we've got one of the robust -- the most robust category management programs in place here. And the beauty about category management, it's all about puts and takes, and you're constantly moving around, doing what's right for the business and right for the margin. I think in terms of sourcing, I think there's still a tremendous opportunity there, particularly when the non-consumable side of the business starts to gain a little traction again. The private brand business for us, we continue to be amazed at the number of items we can add. Distribution and transportation, I have to say, our sourcing team continues to surprise us on how they can cube out a truck and cut back on stem miles. I see no reason for that to abate. Yes, another distribution center coming online toward the first quarter of next year that I think will do, again, give us opportunity to help on the margin. And shrink, I have to say, I've been doing this for a long period of time. Even before our shrink went a little sideways a couple of quarters ago, I -- we still saw room for improvement there, as good as we've done and as far as we've come. And the thing about shrink, it's just not a straight line to the top. It -- you do really well for a period of time, and then you kind of have to realign everything and get after it. So I will tell you that my view is, as I look out down the road, I feel as good about our ability to manage the margin in the future as I do today. Operator : Our next question will come from Mark Miller, William Blair. Mark Miller : A question about store manager turnover. I know last quarter you had upbeat comments about that. Can you share with us what you're seeing here in 2013? And I was wondering if you see a risk that turnover could rise as employment opportunities are better in the market? That has happened in the past and might make that -- might that make it tougher to bring shrink down?  So I'm speaking about a cyclical headwind here. Richard Dreiling : Yes. Hey, Mark, there's no doubt that store manager turnover and shrink, there is a direct correlation. Right? And there's also a direct correlation to store standards and customer service. Our store manager turnover at the conclusion of the first quarter approved yet again and was down from the previous year. Store manager turnover in retail to me usually runs in the mid- to high-20s, and we're rapidly getting into that, getting towards that number. I do think the advantage that we have with our store managers today, as I look at it over the last -- particularly the last 5 years, is -- my view is the quickest way to a store manager's heart is through their wallet. And the company has performed very well, and we're paying out bonuses better, much better than they've been in the past. So I look at the store manager turnover in 2012 as the best it's been in 5 years. It is not -- has not changed. And I think we're going to be able to hold on to them. Mark Miller : Okay, that's great. And I have a question about tobacco. So it does obviously lift the business as that gets rolled out. Can you just talk about longer term? I mean, obviously, if the category is in decline, what do you think your comps can be there, year 2, year 3? Do you think you can increase that? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think the -- well, by the way, I agree with you. Tobacco is a very different -- difficult category. We have said that -- there is one good thing about tobacco, why usage goes down every year. The manufacturer increases the cost, which we turn around and then tax increases that we pass on to the consumer. So there is a built-in comp there. The comp we're looking at right now, as we've said, will be about the same as beer and wine for 2012. Operator : Our next question will come from John Zolidis, Marketing and Research. John Zolidis : A question on traffic. You mentioned it was positive, I think, for the 21st consecutive quarter. In that context, can you talk about the customer demographic? Are you seeing a deceleration of higher-income customers coming into the store? How has your customer kind of changed compared to 2 to 3 years ago in terms of income profile? And what do you expect going forward in terms of which new customers you're most likely to attract and you hope to help you drive the business? Richard Dreiling : Yes, good question. The core customer for us in terms of the amount of our sales that they are generating remains as consistent as it's been the last 3 or 4 years. There is no evidence at this time that there's a change with the trade-down customer or the trade-in customer. I have not seen anything that indicates that. I can tell you -- you do your market research, John, with the customer about every year. The last time we did that, which was probably 3 or 4 months ago, there was no indication from the higher demographic that if the economy got significantly better, that they were going to trade out of the channel. And again, though, it's too soon for me to tell you that as we begin to move through the year. But right now, the fastest-growing customer segment we still have is that customer that's around $7,000 -- $50,000 to $70,000 a year, which is above the income of our core customer. Operator : Next question, Dutch Fox, FBR Capital Markets. Dutch Fox : So moving over to the balance sheet, I was curious. Could you talk to us a little bit about the inventory we built -- build we saw this quarter? What that primarily related to tobacco? And if it was, should we continue to expect 10 plus or so per square foot growth in inventory over the course of the year? And I have a quick follow-up to -- answer to a question you guys gave a little bit earlier. David Tehle : Sure. If we look at our inventories for the quarter, our turns were 5.0 in the quarter. If we look at the increase, as you mentioned, we were up about 14%, which is higher than we'd like to be. We added new items in 2012 that rolled over. And then as Rick mentioned, we did a lot of planogram work in first quarter. We pushed a lot of the things we would have done later in the year into first quarter to get a head start on it. So with those planogram shifts, we brought in more inventory. And then certainly, as you mentioned, we had the tobacco inventory that came in in one fell swoop and hit us. Keep in mind, as we look at our inventory, the vast majority of the increase that we have is in our core inventory, and a large piece of that is in our consumable side of the house overall. As we look at inventory for the year, and we mentioned this last time, we see the inventory staying pretty close to where it is short term. But then as we get to the back half of the year, seeing improvement in terms of the inventory growth versus the sales growth and getting more in line with sales growth, i.e., inventory growing closer to the rate that we see sales growing. So that's how we're calling it right now. Richard Dreiling : And, Dutch, I'd like to throw in -- my personal contribution of the inventory growth is the in-stock initiatives, that we're very committed to being in stock, and that's creating a little bit of growth, too. Dutch Fox : Okay. And Rick, just to clarify on an answer you gave to a previous question when asked about trends in managing, you said you were smack dab in the middle of guidance. Can you -- are you talking about the 4 to 5 guidance for the year? Quarter-to-date, you're running something better than a 4. Is that what you're trying to say? Richard Dreiling : I'm just saying that I'm really pleased with where sales are so far in this quarter on this day. Mary Winn Gordon : Well, with it -- Dutch, it's Mary Winn. With the update on our guidance, where we just updated to that 4 to 5, I think you -- we said we had a solid start to the quarter, so you would start to see some acceleration there. Operator : Our next question will come from Dan Wewer, Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : So Rick, as I recall, Buck Holdings has 3 seats on your Board of Directors. But if their ownership drops below 5%, they no longer have that guaranteed representation. Can you tell us how you're thinking about changing the board going forward in light of their ownership change? Richard Dreiling : Yes. The first thing I'd like to say, Dan -- and by the way, it's very -- another very fair question. First thing I'd like to say is you're talking about Adrian Jones, Mike and Raj. And I would just like to say, the value they've added to that Board of Directors over the last 5 years has just been -- it's been sensational. It's been great working with them. As we move through the course of the year, it's fair to say we'll need to step back and take a look at that. We just recently elected them for another year. And I think as we move through the year, we'll take a look at that. Now I have asked Mike Calbert, who I believe to be one of the best business partners I've had, to stay on as lead director. And he has agreed to that. But then we'll work our way through the other 2 seats as we move through the year. Daniel Wewer : Okay. And then just to beat the dead horse one more time, I think what's a little puzzling for those of us on the call are, one, why are you lowering the high end of the comp sales guidance from 6% to 5%? I mean, it's a small change to begin with, particularly if you're indicating you're off to a solid start in the second quarter. And then further, and not to talk about the reasons why the margin guidance is dropping, but gosh, it was only March 25 that the company last gave guidance. And we knew at that time there was going to be significant growth in these higher-priced SKUs that are susceptible to shrink and you have a lot of experienced people in your staff. So I'm just -- those are the 2 things I think are really puzzling. Richard Dreiling : Yes, Dan. I think that -- and again, I think that's, again, a quality question here. I think that -- I've always prided myself on being incredibly transparent and calling it like I see it when I see it. And we moved into March knowing that it was going to be tough period. And we didn't fare through it as well as we thought we would, but the thing that we did see is when we came out of March -- and by the way, in March, we were up against a double-digit comp from the previous year. We didn't see April catch as fast as we thought it was going to. In fact, we went through a couple of weeks in April before the sales started to accelerate. And what we have noticed over the course of the last few weeks is, no doubt, a shift that's taking place within consumables, as well as the non-consumable side. And while we are better off in non-consumables today than where we were in the first quarter, we're still not where we want to be. And I thought it was prudent since a 4 to 5 comp is still a -- which I think is a pretty healthy comp to stand up to, I thought it was prudent to just tell you what I was thinking. In regards to the margin, while you're seeing that mix, that mix change in non-consumables, you're -- excuse me, you're also seeing a mix change in consumables and the customers gravitating into a lower-margin national brand item. And we haven't seen a lot of that before. And again, that comes back to -- I think we were a little overzealous in adding SKUs in there. Daniel Wewer : So when you were completing cycle inventories after you cut off the fiscal year 2012, that's when you began to get some bad numbers roll in? Richard Dreiling : No, I had -- I don't want to incur that we're seeing bad numbers. What I'm seeing is as we move through March, we started to see a change in the purchasing pattern of the customer. Our traffic's great, the basket is great, it's just what they're buying is just a little bit different. And we also thought that we would see more progress on the shrink side of the ledger. And it's proving to be a little bit more difficult. And again, that's why we're -- that's how we're -- that's why we're looking at that. So... Operator : Our next question will come from Peter Keith, Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : I just want to wrap up with a question on Phase 5 and kind of how you're thinking about that as a sales benefit for the full year. It looks like you're bringing in mostly HBA inventory. And kind of in that context, your main competitor in this space has talked about HBA inventory kind of having a long sales ramp because it turns slower. So could you kind of summarize how Phase 5 has fit into the guidance in terms -- if there is a benefit? Or we should be patient on the ramp that you're going to see from the new inventory? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think as I look at Phase 5, it's HBA, but it's also some grocery -- consumable items, too. Think in terms of paper, in terms of the chemical side of the business. We do particularly good in candy and snacks. So there is the non -- the consumable as well as the HBA. I will tell you, those stores that have been completed, and it's awfully soon to tell, the consumer has to find the product, realize it's there, but they're already running 1% above what they were trending and continuing to improve on that. So we feel pretty good about that, that group of stores. Mary Winn Gordon : All right. Operator, I think we're at the top of the hour. So with that, we will conclude our call. Thank you very much for your interest in Dollar General. Emma Jo and I are around all day. I know we're leaving a few people in the queue, and I do apologize on that, but please feel free to give us a call. And we look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this conference has now concluded. You may disconnect your phone lines and have a great rest of the week. Thank you.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General's Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Mary Winn Gordon, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations, you may begin your conference. Mary Winn Gordon : Thank you, Brandy, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com, under Investor Information, Press Releases.  Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, objectives, anticipated financial and operating results and other nonhistorical matters. Some examples of forward-looking statements discussed in this call include our 2013 forecasted financial results and anticipated capital expenditures, our planned operating and merchandising initiatives for fiscal 2013, our share repurchase expectations and statements regarding future consumer economic trends. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2012 10-K, which was filed on March 25; our fourth -- first quarter 10-Q, which was filed on May 3; and our second quarter 10-Q, which was filed this morning; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call. We will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which I mentioned is posted on dollargeneral.com. This information is not a substitute for any GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. I'm pleased to report that our comp store sales accelerated to 5.1% in the quarter. This was on top of a 5.1% comp in the second quarter last year and a 5.9% comp the year before. I really want to emphasize that the acceleration of our traffic in the second quarter above our already strong traffic trends. Both traffic and average tickets have increased for 22 consecutive quarters. Total sales grew 11.3% to $4.4 billion. While consumables showed the strongest gains, I was pleased with the overall sales growth across our non-consumable categories. Operating profit, excluding certain items, increased by 9% to $421 million, or 9.6% of sales, which was down just 24 basis points from last year as we managed the impact of lower-margin sales growth through strong SG&A leverage.  Our gross profit rate of 31.3% of sales was 65 basis points less than last year's second quarter, with the majority of the rate compression resulting from our very successful launch of tobacco products across the chain. Tobacco sales contributed nicely to our sales growth and SG&A leverage.  GAAP earnings per share increased 17% to $0.75. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased to $0.77, giving a strong double-digit growth.  We continue to return cash to our shareholders through $200 million of share repurchases in the second quarter. We had a strong second quarter and remain on track to meet the full year expectations we shared with you last quarter. We continue to increase our overall market share of consumables in units and dollars over the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week periods.  Our recent share gains according to Nielsen data actually accelerated during the second quarter. We see this as a clear sign that we are serving our customers' needs and playing an increasingly important role in their shopping routine.  I'll talk more about our operating initiatives in a moment, but now I'd like to turn the call over to David. David Tehle : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick covered the highlights of our second quarter sales performance, so starting with gross profit, I'll share more of the details.  Our gross profit increased 9% for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, gross profit decreased by 65 basis points to 31.3%. As expected, the gross margin rate was impacted by a higher consumables mix and lower initial markups, primarily due to the rollout of tobacco and the growth in the sales of perishables. In addition, our inventory shrinkage rate increased, although at a lower rate than in the first quarter. This margin compression was partially offset by a benefit from transportation efficiencies, lower markdowns, primarily due to the later timing of apparel markdowns and a favorable LIFO credit.  SG&A expense was 21.9% of sales in the 2013 period, or 21.8%, excluding an $8.5 million legal settlement. Our SG&A rate improved by 41 basis points, excluding certain items as detailed in our press release. Further improvements driven by our workforce management system resulted in strong retail labor expense leverage in the quarter. In addition, the year-over-year SG&A improvement reflect the decrease in incentive compensation expense, improved leverage on utilities costs and lower workers' compensation and general liability expenses. Costs that increased at a higher rate than our increase in sales includes repairs and maintenance, debit card fees and depreciation and amortization. Interest expense of $21 million represents a $15 million decrease from the 2012 second quarter, the result of our favorable refinancing transactions over the past year.  The second quarter tax rate was a more normalized 37.4% compared to last year's effective tax rate of 34.1%, which reflected a $14.5 million favorable income tax audit resolution. Please keep in mind that in the second quarter of 2012, we called out this tax benefit of approximately $0.04 per share. Excluding this adjustment from last year, our 2013 effective rate was lower than last year's rate due primarily to federal jobs credits, which were not in effect in last year's quarter. On a reported basis, our net income increased 15% to $245 million, or $0.75 per share in the 2013 quarter from $214 million, or $0.64 per share, in the 2012 quarter. Excluding the $8.5 million legal settlement, second quarter 2013 earnings per share was $0.77, in line with our internal expectations when we revised full year earnings guidance in our first quarter earnings call.  Adjusted earnings per share in the 2012 quarter was $0.69, as reconciled in our press release for that period. If you additionally subtract the $0.04 benefit resulting from the tax adjustment in the 2012 period, underlying second quarter 2013 earnings per share increased 18%.  Year-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $484 million, up $111 million from last year. Capital expenditures totaled $309 million, including $127 million for upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $66 million related to new leased stores; $52 million for stores we purchased or built; $49 million for distribution and transportation; and $12 million for information systems upgrade. Year-to-date, we have opened 375 new stores, which puts us well ahead of last year's base. We have also relocated or remodeled 377 stores, and we've made significant progress on our new distribution center in Bethel, Pennsylvania. We continue to be pleased with our performance of our new, relocated and remodeled stores.  As previously announced, we have repurchased $220 million of our common stock this year, including $200 million in the second quarter. We have approximately $424 million remaining in the existing authorization. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased approximately $1.1 billion, or 23.6 million shares of our common stock, and we plan to remain consistent, as well as opportunistic, in our share repurchases going forward.  Looking at the balance sheet as of August 2, total inventories were $2.53 billion, up about 11% on a per-store basis. We made good progress from last quarter's inventory growth of 14%, even as the second quarter includes more impact from our tobacco rollout.  Higher inventory balances over the last couple of quarters have resulted in a modest decline in inventory turns to 4.9x. However, the quality and aging of our inventory continues to be in good shape, and we expect the year-over-year inventory growth rate to decrease as we move through the second half of the year.  As of August 2, we had outstanding long-term obligations of $2.87 billion, in line with last year's balance, although with much better rates and terms. We're very pleased with our current capital structure and the flexibility that it affords us. Now, to guidance.  We continue to expect total sales for the year to increase 10% to 11%. Same-store sales are expected to increase 4% to 5%. As a reminder, there are 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will likely impact our sales to some extent in the fourth quarter.  We're forecasting gross margin contraction for the full year to be approximately 90 basis points. As you model gross margin performance in the third and fourth quarter, it's important to keep a couple of factors in perspective. As I mentioned, we had lower markdowns in the second quarter, primarily due to the timing of markdowns in apparel, given the way the summer weather played out. Year-over-year, we're forecasting a shift of some of these markdowns into the third quarter. The shift in weather gave us the opportunity to be nimble and maximize our sales of full-priced apparel items.  And finally, last year, we had our best gross margin performance in the fourth quarter, and we expect that comparison to be challenging. Adjusted operating profit for 2013 is expected to be in the range of $1.73 billion to $1.77 billion.  Interest expense is forecasted to be approximately $95 million. The full year 2013 effective tax rate is expected to be between 37.5% and 38%. Adjusted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.22. Our EPS forecast is based on approximately 324 million weighted average diluted shares, which assumes approximately $600 million of share repurchases for the full year.  Our full-year operating profit and earnings per share guidance are based on adjustments consistent with those detailed in our earnings release for the year-to-date results.  Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million. We now plan to open approximately 650 new stores for the full year. That's an increase of 15 stores from our previous guidance. Remodels and relocations are expected to total approximately 550 stores for the year.  In summary, our outlook for the year is solid. We remain excited about our organic growth opportunities. We are committed to returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and building on our proven track record.  For now, I'll turn the call back over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, David. We had a strong second quarter, and while it is still early, the third quarter is off to a solid start, and I believe we have a great plan for the remainder of the year. We remain cautious on our consumer and our spending in the second half of the year, as we have been all year. But as the result of our customer-focused initiatives, we are starting the quarter with momentum. Let's start with tobacco, our single largest undertaking in the second quarter.  We began the tobacco rollout in mid-March, halfway through the first quarter, and we exited the second quarter with the rollout of tobacco complete. This was a tremendous undertaking, and I would like to commend the entire Dollar General team for a remarkably successful implementation of tobacco across nearly 10,500 stores in a period of 3 months.  With the rollout now complete across the chain, coupled with the experience we have in our stores that have been selling tobacco for several months now, we're gaining greater insight into the tobacco category and our customers. As I said earlier, we are seeing a significant increase in our traffic, and tobacco has been a key driver.  Our experience so far reinforces my belief that traffic is the most important metric to watch as we measure the overall success of our decision to add tobacco products in our stores. Our sales and our traffic are continuing to build each week, along with our customers' awareness.  Tobacco sales are consistently running about 1/3 tobacco-only, and the remaining 2/3 are tobacco plus one or more items.  Next, during the second quarter, we completed Phase 5 of our evolution in merchandising. The focus of Phase 5 was to optimize productivity in our legacy stores, many of which are less than 7,000 square feet.  We went into these stores, about 3,000 of them, and reset various planograms to better utilize shelf and floor space by adding more productive items and eliminating less productive items, such as hanging apparel in some of the smaller stores. We are pleased with the sales comp lift from this initiative as our customers realize we've expanded our product assortments in key categories.  As a result of this project, we've identified additional opportunities for future productivity gains in these legacy stores. We continue to be pleased with the results of our cooler expansion for perishable items. Through the second quarter, we have added over 7,000 cooler doors, expanding coolers in over 1,600 existing stores. Most of these stores are now consistent with our new store standard of 16 cooler doors.  Through the second quarter, we opened 375 new stores, including 15 Dollar General Market and 21 Dollar General Plus formats. We're well ahead of where we were this time last year in the number of stores and operating weeks. Our new stores are continuing to deliver strong performance. We now have 69 stores in California, stretching over 600 miles from north of Sacramento to south of San Bernardino. As we enter our second year in California, we're continuing to refine our market entry strategy to better optimize our overall performance. We are currently utilizing all 3 of our store formats in California, and we are pleased with our sales results.  As David mentioned, our current store development pipeline is robust, and we're raising our new store outlook for this year to 650 stores. We have remodeled or relocated 377 stores so far this year, including 65 Dollar General Plus stores. The Dollar General Plus format is a great tool for relocations, and the expanded refrigerated and frozen food assortment in these stores is driving a higher basket.  We're continuing to learn and test new ideas in our Dollar General Market, particularly in how to best serve our customers in the fresh meat and produce areas. In many of our market locations, these stores are providing a much needed option for a broader Dollar General shopping trip. In our ongoing commitment to helping our customers save time and money and our own journey of elevating sales performance, we have continued to update the appearance and layout of our customer-centric store model. Freshening the look of the store is something I believe all great retailers should do periodically. This year, we have rolled out a new fresh look to further enhance our customer shopping experience. We've implemented the new format in more than 550 stores, including new stores, relocations and remodels. The updated 2013 design has new in-store signage and branding, with a refreshed look that leverages our yellow and black color scheme. We configured sections such as apparel and seasonal and yet again, improved the category adjacencies in these stores. We believe this well-designed format really makes sense and is proving to resonate with our customers. To date, we're excited about the comp sales lift in our remodels and relocations, and we're hearing great feedback from our customers on the new layout and fresh look.  At the end of the second quarter, we had 10,866 stores in 40 states, well on our way to reaching our 11,000 store milestone in October. And the good news is that we continue to see significant, exciting opportunities for organic growth.  Our customers are depending on our convenience and everyday low prices more than ever. We're focused on meeting their needs with the right merchandise selections at the right prices throughout the entire store. We're continually expanding our footprint and improving our operations and believe we have a long runway for continued success in both existing and new markets.  Before I open for questions, I want to thank our employees from coast to coast, serving our customers and representing the Dollar General brand in our communities every day. Now, Mary Winn, I'll open it up for questions. Mary Winn Gordon : All right, Brandy, we'll start out with our first question, please. Operator : So our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Can you speak to the monthly progression and drivers of the traffic acceleration that you spoke to? And also, give us a little bit more color on August, both total sales and maybe some of the discretionary versus consumables? It sounds like you mentioned it was off to a pretty good start. Richard Dreiling : Yes. The -- quarter 2, the sales accelerated as we moved through the quarter. The really encouraging thing was not only did sales accelerate, but unit growth and market share growth accelerated as we moved through the quarter also, which is kind of how we called it and how we anticipated as we move through the balance of the year. In regard to August, I don't want to really get into where we are in the third quarter other than to really say that we feel pretty comfortable with where we are and where we're heading. Matthew Boss : Wow. That's great. And then secondly, can you speak to the rationale behind raising the new store growth target for this year, what you're seeing from some of your younger stores and then how we should think about the growth profile ahead. Any changes to your thinking? Richard Dreiling : Yes. Actually, I think, as I look at the fact that we raised the number of new stores, it's driven primarily by the robustness of the store pipeline right now. As you guys remember, last year, we got a little bit behind on it, and we had to work our way through it. So we feel pretty good where we're going this year. And I should also throw out, too, as I sit here and think about the question, we're getting the stores open earlier this year, which I think is helping. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Brian Cullinane : This is actually Bryan Cullinane on for Scott. You highlighted -- you showed -- your comps were accelerated, and you highlighted that you're gaining share. Who do you guys think that, that share is coming from? Richard Dreiling : Yes. When I look at Nielsen share data, it's coming from drug, first; grocery, second; and mass, third. And I think the other, Brian, wonderful thing about our format is we compete in that great, big world of consumable retailing, which is well over $800 billion. So we're able to go in and take a little bit from a lot of different spots, and we're kind of one of those guys you don't really feel. Brian Cullinane : And then the second question -- we saw some good share repurchase activity. Can you just, maybe going forward, prioritize your uses of cash from where you stand now? David Tehle : Yes, absolutely. It really hasn't changed from what we've articulated previously. Our #1 priority for cash is investing in the business, as evidenced by adding to the store count for this year. We're going to open new stores, we're going to do remodels, we're going to do relocations, and then we're going to make sure we have the infrastructure in the business to support the stores because that's our #1 priority, and we think that's the best return for our shareholders. And then with the cash that's left over, we'll buy back stock with that, as evidenced by the stock buyback you saw in the quarter, the $200 million buyback which we did at $51.28. So obviously, we got in there opportunistically, and we were able to get a nice slug of stock bought back. So those are really our priorities for cash. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : Just a follow-up on the last one. Any sense for what you think the appropriate leverage point is in the business? David Tehle : Yes. Right now -- and again, we've mentioned this before -- we believe it's best for us to be investment-grade, which implies a debt-to-EBITDA of about 3.0. And if you look at our statistics over the past several quarters, that's where we've been, and that's where we ended up in Q2. So that's the general leverage point that we're aiming for. Stephen Grambling : And would you be averse to taking on additional debt as you continue to generate excess cash as it comes in kind of above your plan or even within your plan? David Tehle : Well, certainly, if we need to take on additional debt to stay at 3.0, we would definitely consider doing that. Yes. Stephen Grambling : Okay. And then one on -- just more fundamental question, which is when you think about the traffic that's being driven by tobacco, do you have any sense for -- if that's a new customer versus the existing customer just taking an additional trip? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think it's actually a combination of both. And I -- we don't have a card, so it's really kind of hard to go in and measure, Stephen, what's going on. But our belief is that the customer that's coming in, that's primarily buying just tobacco, is probably the newer customer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : I just wanted to follow up actually first on the last question on the leverage ratio and the appropriate level of business. Can you just maybe remind us why you think investment grade is so important? You've obviously operated at levels below that historically. David Tehle : Yes. Well, I think we demonstrated that in the last refinancing that we did in terms of the interest rates that we were able to get on the debt. And you heard in my opening comments how much lower interest is this year than what it was last year. I mean, it's really adding to our overall bottom line. So it gives us access to the credit markets in a way that I think is very flexible and healthy for the company. It also helps us with our vendors and on the real estate front being investment grade in terms of the types of deals that we're able to do. So we take a hard look at this several times a year and discuss it. Rick and I discuss it with the board. And clearly, we feel like right now, that's the best place for us to be. Edward Kelly : Okay. And, Rick, just a bigger-picture question for you strategically. I was hoping maybe you could just give us your updated view on sort of organic growth versus growing via acquisition. You've obviously favored organic growth historically. Why is that, I guess? And could -- what would change that going forward? And this doesn\u2019t even necessarily apply to large deals because there are smaller guys out there too that potentially could make sense. So I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are there. Richard Dreiling : Yes, it's a really good question, Ed. I -- we still have over 10,000 opportunities out there in the marketplace today, in the United States today, for Dollar stores. And we have a very proven format that generates the best returns in retail that I have ever seen in my career. And it's much easier to manage that than it is to try and manage an acquisition. And my love of organic growth is the fact that when you go into a new market, you understand the market but more importantly, you understand the player set that's going to launch that for you. So I've always been a lover of organic growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi. Deborah Weinswig : Taking on the kind of new store pipeline, can you talk about what 2014 looks like? And based on raising your new store activity for this year, does the competitive landscape look any different in terms of looking at new stores and what the markets look like? Richard Dreiling : Yes. Our 2014 pipeline is actually ahead of schedule, exactly like '13. And this is the second year in a row where we'll be able to be in a much stronger position as we enter into the new year. David and I like that 6% to 7% square footage growth. It's more, Deb, about organizational capacity than it is anything else. And this company got itself in trouble 7 years ago about opening too many stores too fast, and I -- we would rather open a handful of stores that perform well and drive a great return than get ourselves out there and overextend ourselves. Deborah Weinswig : Okay. And another question on this topic, are you utilizing a different team? Are you utilizing better technology? Is there anything differently that you're doing in terms of getting sites? Richard Dreiling : No. Actually, everything is exactly what it has been. We're just doing a better job of getting ahead of the pipeline curve. And quite honestly, it's like everything else we do at Dollar General. I'm surrounded by a team that continually improves on the processes that have been established over the years. Deborah Weinswig : Great. And then in terms of the beat this quarter not rolling that in terms of raising guidance for the year, can we just dig into that a little bit deeper? David Tehle : Yes. In terms of our -- and we generally don't talk about our internal estimates. But actually, the quarter came in pretty much as we expected it in our internal guidance that we had given last quarter. So from our perspective, it wasn't really a beat. We performed how we thought we would perform. So there really isn't anything to increase for the rest of the year as we came out. Now we did tweak our -- some of our assumptions on interest and tax rate and share count and things of that nature. I'm looking forward -- given the uncertainty and the macroeconomic environment, we're trying to make sure we're prudent in the things we're doing above the line. So again, we're pleased with where we are, and we're pleased that, again, we're pretty much on where we said we would be when we updated our guidance last quarter. Deborah Weinswig : Okay. And then one last quick one. Rick, when you look into the market share gains by category, is there anything there that's surprising to you? Richard Dreiling : Actually, no, there's not, Deb. What's interesting to me, what has surprised me, it's relatively -- it's even across most of the categories. It was interesting, I was talking to Mary Winn yesterday, and it was one of those quarters in which the boat was rising on all of the sides. Everything is -- reminds me very much again of 2008 and 2009, where everything is starting to rise evenly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne Agee. Charles Grom : Just a few things, David, for us on just for modeling. I guess, first, would be can you quantify the list of sales from tobacco? What do you think the incentive comp accrual reversal was in the quarter? And then could you quantify the mark down shift between the second and third quarter for us? David Tehle : Yes. I don't think we're going to give granular quantification on those, Chuck. I mean, obviously, the tobacco had a meaningful impact on the quarter overall in terms of what this performance was on the comp sales and particularly in driving traffic into the stores. It's more than what we've seen in beer and wine overall, which is very positive for us. And then again, on the expense side, it was meaningful enough that we wanted to spell out the incentive comp overall. But again, not going to give specifics on that or the markdown. Except on the markdown, I will say, again for modeling purposes, the reason we bring that up is that is something that was a benefit to second quarter that's going to hit third quarter. And we want to make sure everybody's aware of that as they start putting their third quarter models together. Richard Dreiling : Chuck, I'd say one thing on the tobacco that we are really focused on here in the company. It is not about the comp sales it's driving, it's about the transactions it's driving. And what we are totally focused on is how we could take that tobacco purchase and lever it up with incremental items when that transaction takes place in the store. Charles Grom : Makes sense. And then I guess it's kind of impressive that you roll out tobacco and you see the shrink rate improve. Can you kind of flush that out for us? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think the rate of decline and shrink is what has improved, Chuck. I will tell you, in regards to shrink, we've installed a lot of defensive merchandising over the course of the last 6, 7, 8 months and had the chance now to go in and reinventory those stores. And while it's still soon, we're very pleased with what we're seeing with the defensive merchandising that's been put in place. Charles Grom : Okay, great. And then just my last question, just a follow-up on a previous one. When you sort of think about capital allocation versus store growth, and you talk about the 6% to 7% square footage growth number that you want to keep, as the law of large numbers starts to catch up with you, do you think the next 3 to 4 years we continue to see 6% to 7% store growth? Or does organization capacity make you want to think -- maybe ratchet that back a little bit and increase the buybacks? I mean, how do you kind of think about the whole pie? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think -- again, you're raising a great question. We're very comfortable right now at this stage of the game with 6% to 7%. But again, I want to come back to how I answered the question previously. We want to open stores that are productive out of the chute in generating a return. And we would rather open stores that are complete, that the customer has an experience when they come in, rather than just come in and look at you all and say, \"Hey, open a bunch of stores.\" David Tehle : I said go back to Rick's comment on the continuous improvement we've seen in the real estate area, which helps us, again, to reach that 6% to 7% the way real estate's performing. Charles Grom : Right. So you guys are like basically tracking new store productivity and store manager turnover to make sure that you don't sort of outgrow, which was a problem, I guess, 10 years ago? Richard Dreiling : That's exactly right. And we, Chuck, actually look at new store growth productivity every week. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Matthew Siler : It's actually Matt for Paul. I just had a question. In terms of the competitive environment, we've seen some of the mass guys put up some disappointing results lately. Just wondering if you saw any kind of change in rhetoric or anything in the marketplace throughout the prior quarter and thus far, into this one? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I look back on quarter 2 much like quarter 1 and look at -- and would tell you that the share of voice is obviously up. There's no doubt there's more print advertising out there, more pages of print even within the usual weekly vehicles. However, it's fair to say that the price competition is not any more intense in quarter 2 than quarter 3. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So if you look at kind of the 2-year stock comps on the discretionary front, at least the way we calculate it, it looks like seasonal and home were basically flat year-over-year versus the first quarter, but apparel improved pretty nicely. But then you mention there are some markdowns, particularly in apparel, that we need to think about for the third quarter. Can you guys provide us a little bit more color on the discretionary front and specifically on the apparel, and kind of what your expectations are for those categories going forward? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I mean, I, quite frankly, was pleased with what happened on the discretionary side of the ledger in the second quarter. And quite honestly, very proud of the team on the apparel side. I think it's definitely too early to declare a victory. I think that, in all honesty, we still need a little bit of help on -- with the economy. And I think it's fair to also say that our consumer is still a little hesitant out there. But I think as we move through the third quarter, we anticipate the trends will not change significantly. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay. And then just a clarification. Did you say all of the gross margin decline in the second quarter was from tobacco? Richard Dreiling : No. Actually, what David said was the bulk of it was, but not all. David Tehle : Tobacco, its mix and its shrink  were probably the 3 biggest negatives. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : Let me ask you, DG Market and DG Plus, when do you think, if ever you begin a more aggressive rollout -- I guess it would be plus. And then is there a merit to, as you learn from DG Market taking, I don't know, Top 20 produce items, top 5 or 10 meat items and migrating those into DG Plus? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think the -- if I were to look at you and tell you right now -- over the course of the last year, we've made more progress on the DG Plus side. I think that, particularly as a remodel or relocation vehicle -- and remodel meaning we can knock into a wall next to us, John -- what we're really excited about on the Dollar General Plus is the change in the basket size. And it comes back to the wider aisles, the shopability of the stores. And when you start with a relo or a remodel, you start with a significantly higher base, which gets you moving in the right direction faster. The Dollar General Market, the team is doing, I think, a great job of really understanding produce sales and meat sales, which I think -- by the way, those are living things that we have not had to deal with before. And I've got Todd and Greg Sparks here, who are helping to manage the team through that. So I -- again, I think it's a little soon to declare victory there. I do think we are moving in the right direction on the Plus side. Your comment on perhaps making -- taking the Top 20 produce items and eventually getting those into the regular Dollar Generals, that is something we're actually talking about. Now whether or not that'll ever happen or not, it's still too soon to tell. But oranges and apples and potatoes, things like that, grab-and-go stuff that a consumer forgets on the way home, could play out down the road. John Heinbockel : So along those lines, what's the biggest challenge to doing that? Is it supply chain, being able to do that -- keep it fresh? Is it something else? And then secondly, where would you get the space for that? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I mean -- actually, you nailed it. The supply chain is the issue. And not only that, on that kind of an item, we have to introduce a middleman because we don't warehouse our own produce and you run the risk of having an item that's a little bit higher and depletes your --  your customer doesn't understand that it's coming from somewhere else, and it kind of depletes your price image. In regards to -- what you should also remember, if we were ever to do this, it wouldn't be like there would be a whole isle of produce or an end cap of -- It would be a very small, manageable display. John Heinbockel : All right. Then lastly, you mentioned shrink, and I know that dovetails very close with turnover. So where is turnover today? And then do you think turnover will be in a good enough position where shrink actually comes down next year? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I'm actually -- the team, John, has done a good job with turnover over the last 2.5 years. And I have to tell you, our turnover is, in essence, flat the last year. And we're having our -- our best year was 2012, by the way. And to be flat against 2012, I think it's a pretty good mark. And I do agree that turnover is a big component of shrink. And I think that we're working really hard on the turnover, and I think the shrink numbers are starting to move our way again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : We totally agree, totally support your view to use your capital for our organic growth rather than acquisitions. I want to ask about inventory productivity. Regardless of how you measure that based on GMROI, or the amount of gross profits generated from $1 of inventory at peak last year and, again, to weaken as the company began to add 11% to 15% more inventory per store, is this a signal that your buyers did it right, that the first $210,000 of inventory they bought for our store was the most profitable, and that the incremental $20,000 that you've added this year is -- it's profitable but not as productive as that initial $210,000 investment? Richard Dreiling : Yes. Actually, I think that's a pretty accurate assessment, to be honest about it. I think it really tells you the power of category management. The team came in here several years ago, rationalized the SKU base, got the SKU base right. As we continue to broaden our appeal, it means we need to add selective, other SKUs. And I think quite frankly, we got a little overzealous in quarter 1. And what we're doing now is we're spending a lot of time -- the product, by the way, while I say we got a little overzealous, there's nothing wrong with the product that's in the store base. And the decision we've made is we're going to go in and reevaluate it and, over a period of time, take some of those SKUs, Dan, that you were talking about, that aren't quite as productive, and just work some way back out of the system. Daniel Wewer : And then -- just as a follow-up, it was definitely 3 or 4 quarters ago when the tobacco discussion began. The company was estimating that every 1 percentage of comp sales growth from tobacco would negatively impact gross margin rates by about 20 basis points. It looks like the algebra has changed based on the comps that you're getting in tobacco and what's happened with gross margin rates? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I don't recall giving you that. If I did, I did. I would look at you and tell you that the tobacco, the tag-along purchases with tobacco are a little bit better than we thought they were going to be. How's that? I don't know if that helps or not, Dan. Daniel Wewer : The 65% of the customers that are buying something else has turned out to be higher than what you were expecting. Richard Dreiling : Exactly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Mann with Johnson Rice. David Mann : I was curious, just elaborating on the comment you just made about some of the SKUs that you added, I know last quarter you talked a lot about the gross margin hit when the mix between national brands and private brands sort of got a little bit out of kilter. So I'm just curious, were you able to -- since -- were you able to re-pivot into this quarter such that you -- it didn't even become a comment? I mean, is that what you've been working through? Richard Dreiling : I'm sorry, Dan. Actually, Dan, our private brand penetration is actually back up, moving north again. So that would tell you that we're doing a better job in managing the mix. David Mann : Okay, great. And then in terms of tobacco, I know in the past you've given us what that average ticket might be. Can you update on that? And also, I don't know if you specifically talked about what the shrink experience is in tobacco is relative to what you expected. If you could comment there as well? Richard Dreiling : Yes. It's really too soon, Dan, on the shrink. Right? I have -- we'll have to cycle a whole year tobacco. Right now, I will tell you the supply chain system that keeps track of the tobacco, how it flows from the supplier to a point where it gets stocked on the shelf, is working quite nicely. We've had a couple of issues and have been able to identify them immediately. In regards to cigarettes, the average -- our average basket is approximately $10.77. And when cigarettes are in there, that basket goes up to almost $13.75. David Mann : Okay. And then, David, one other question on the buyback. I think the math would suggest that you might be in the market for up to $400 million for the rest of the year. I'm just curious, when you made that $200 million purchase, it seemed like you didn't buy anymore in the rest of the quarter. Any comment you can make about that? David Tehle : Yes. Quite simply, we wanted to keep our debt-to-EBITDA at 3.0, and that's exactly where we came in. Again, we're managing that ratio because of our investment-grade status. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research. John Zolidis : A lot of questions on tobacco. I have one question, which may sound a little bit counterintuitive, but is there any sense at which having tobacco in the stores is causing customers to substitute their spend to tobacco from something else? Is there any evidence of that occurring? Richard Dreiling : That's actually, John, a very, very good question. I would look at you, there's no way I can tell that. But what I can tell you is that our customer index is at about 135% on cigarettes. So, John, they're buying those cigarettes somewhere else. John Zolidis : Okay. And then on a different topic, on the new stores, can you talk a little bit about the real estate prices for new stores? Are you seeing a lot of pressure? Is there any change or any intentional change in the quality of the locations you're going into with the new stores? Richard Dreiling : Yes. Our -- the real estate strategy in regards to locations, everything -- I would call it status quo over the last couple of years. There's been no major uptick in commercial real estate at all that we have seen, and we're still committed to the site selection process that we've always had. We don't put it on the corner of Maine and Maine, and we're very happy with a C Plus, D Plus site. John Zolidis : So the biggest call-out with regard to new stores over the last couple of years is probably California entry and expanded DG Market, DG Plus? Richard Dreiling : That's fair. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners. Patrick McKeever : A question on your urban market stores now that you have, I guess, more exposure to urban markets, having grown in urban markets more aggressively over the past several years. Did you see any notable performance differential between urban and more overall stores during the quarter? Richard Dreiling : To be honest with you, no. I mean, they tend -- the urban stores tend to have a higher sales volume and a little bit higher cost of operation. And at the end of the day, they net-net out to about the same. Patrick McKeever : But there's -- is there any sense that maybe the urban store performance is improving? Also, what about tobacco sales in urban markets? Is it higher than rural markets? Or is that kind of netting out as well to be pretty neutral. Richard Dreiling : Yes. I've got to tell you that it's pretty much neutral. I don't see any particularly bigger things in the metro stores, the urban stores, versus the rural. Patrick McKeever : Okay. And then just another quick one on tobacco, just to go back to what David was saying. So tobacco, the comp lift is more than beer and wine. And I think you said in the past that beer and wine had about a 100-basis-point positive impact? Is that correct? Richard Dreiling : That's correct, sir. Patrick McKeever : Somewhere north of 100 basis points then? Richard Dreiling : That's correct, sir. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Trish Dill with Wells Fargo Securities. Trisha Dill : Just a question on your Phase 5 initiative. Just wondering if the comp lift that you're seeing in legacy stores is greater or maybe less than 100 basis points like you've previously disclosed? And then if you could maybe just... Richard Dreiling : Is that -- I'm sorry. Trisha Dill : And then if you could just elaborate on the additional opportunities that you mentioned, you've identified for productivity gains in those stores. Richard Dreiling : Yes. I apologize, Trish. Number one, the comp lift is actually a little bit greater than we thought it was. And you've got to remember, we're very new into the cycle here. So as the customer realizes you have the expanded selection in core categories, we anticipate the comp lift will continue to move up as we move through the year. In regards to the additional opportunities, it's more stepping back and going, \"Oh my gosh, these categories did so well. Now, we need to go in and look at these other categories within the same legacy stores.\" So we're going to begin to tweak them again as we move through the year. And we think what we're doing actually has ramifications that maybe -- perhaps we can run at a smaller box store, which will put us, you think, in the urban environment, put us in a little bit better position. Trisha Dill : Okay, great. And then just one more quick one on whether or not you're seeing any food price deflation and how we should think about that as a potential headwind to comps in the back half of the year? Richard Dreiling : Yes. That is actually another good question. We are seeing food deflation at this time. You have to remember that we have a smaller depth in our category, and -- while we have breadth. And we anticipate the deflationary pressure to continue as we move through the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Feldman : I wanted to ask -- go back to the health of the consumer a little bit and just drill down a little more there. Is there anything you guys have seen lately? Any changes with like maybe the pay check cycle or volatility in the week-to-week trend? Or maybe, as you look at the consumables business even, what people are buying? Is it a little more branded versus the private label? Anything that would give you any inkling to the health of the consumer there? Richard Dreiling : Yes. My view on the consumer is no different than what it was, Joe, at the beginning of the year. I think our core customer has never come out of the recession. I think our core customers has continued to manage their way through, for years, multiple points where money is a little tight. I mean, the average consumer out there who makes $50,000 a year has $1,000 a year and less in spendable income now due to changes that have taken place in the payroll tax. Albeit I say all that, I think the beauty of our model is we continue to focus on transactions in units, and our customer is responding to the options -- the value proposition that we have. And as long as transactions and units are moving north, we believe we're satisfying their needs. It is going to be an interesting back half, and I think that we're being -- we're keeping our eye on the consumer and what they're buying. Joseph Feldman : Got you. That sort of leads into the next question we have, which was, as you do think about the back half, and I know you don't like to give quarterly guidance per se, but how should we think about the cadence? I mean, there's been a lot of debate about whether sales have actually slowed or going to slow for this back-to-school period and into the holiday. I guess how are you guys thinking about the back half? Richard Dreiling : We got our guidance between 4% to 5% as we look through the total year, which would indicate that comps will accelerate as we move through the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners. Mark Montagna : A question. I have read recently that government data is showing that commodity inputs for food are up 10%. Wondering if you think that's accurate? And if so, when does that type of thing flow into retail prices for food? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think -- when you look at that, Mark, I think that would probably be focused on meat and produce and more dairy-type items. And my view of how soon it flows in depends on how much pressure are retailers under in regards to their margin, right? So we certainly haven't seen anything of that magnitude here yet, but I would think that's probably more on the true perishable side of the business. Mark Montagna : Okay. And then it sounds like the phase 5 planograms are done for this year, and I thought the goal for this year was 2,000 stores. But then, Rick, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned 3,000. So wondering how many did, and is the whole chain complete now? Or is there more to come? Richard Dreiling : We got 3,000 done. We originally thought it was going to be -- yes, we got 3,000 done. Mary Winn Gordon : Mark, that was our -- that was always our goal. We had completed 2,800 after Q1, and then we ramped that up in Q2. Mark Montagna : Okay. So do you plan more phase 5 for next year? Or is this... Richard Dreiling : Really next year. And actually, what we want to do now is go back into the 3,000 stores which we called out and refine additional categories within that 3,000 -- those wins we've done. Mark Montagna : But looking out to next year, will there be another group that is phase 5? Richard Dreiling : And the answer is probably so. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dutch Fox with FBR Capital Markets. Dutch Fox : So just a quick question and not to beat to death tobacco, but when you see those 2/3 of baskets that are buying tobacco and some other item, is that typically a discretionary item? Or is it more of a consumable item? In other words, you had a very good discretionary quarter in 2Q. How much of that do you think was driven by tobacco? And do you think that's sustainable going forward as tobacco continues to ramp up? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think, Dutch, that cigarette purchase tends to gravitate towards the consumable side of the ledger, particularly when you only have 1 or 2 items going out the door with the cigarettes. That tends to be a soda or a Gatorade or a chip. I think the health of the -- I think it is fair to say -- one could make the leap, and I can't prove this, that the incremental traffic might be helping the nonconsumable side. I don't think there's any kind of a connection between cigarettes and non-consumables. Dutch Fox : So it's fair to say that your -- the improvement we saw in discretionary categories in 2Q, that was largely the result of standalone initiatives within your efforts towards discretionary, not necessarily just driven by tobacco? Richard Dreiling : That's correct. I think the improvement in the discretionary side is driven by good old-fashioned category management. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Denise Chai with Bank of America. Denise Chai : Just wanted to get a little bit more color on what you're seeing with cooler items? Could you talk a bit about trip frequency and also baskets, when people are buying cooler items? And also, you're approaching 70% penetration of your stores. Where do you think that can go? Richard Dreiling : 70% penetration on coolers? Denise Chai : Yes. You said that you've got over 7,000 stores with coolers? Richard Dreiling : Yes. We -- well, we actually installed coolers in over 7,000 stores. So we still have more cooler upside there. I will say this, Denise. The perishable side of the business, the frozen food, refrigerated is insatiable. It seems like the more we put in, the better we do. The basket -- I'm sitting here trying to think on the basket. There's no doubt the basket goes up. I cannot remember, Mary Winn, off the top of my head how much it goes up. And what I'll do, Denise, I'll have Mary Winn call you and give you that number. But we do see a bump in the basket when frozen food's in there. It's more of a complete shop in the $10.70 shop. Denise Chai : And just one more question. You used to talk about having, say, a 1.5% to 2% embedded comp lift from remodels and your various optimization initiatives? Could you perhaps update that and just let us know how much of that has already cycled? David Tehle : Yes, that's really new stores, remodels and relocations all together that -- that figure and that's still reasonably accurate overall. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler : So a question that hasn't come up yet is kind of what do you think happens when SNAP benefits get reduced? Now I know that it's not a huge piece of your revenues, but clearly, it takes money out of the pocket of the lower income customer and could have some impact on, presumably, sales of discretionary, rather than sales of consumables. But I was wondering if you have any thoughts about that? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think one of the interesting things that I've observed since I've been here is our percentage of sales that are on SNAP run about 5% to 6%. In spite of the fact that the government has increased the amount of SNAP benefits that are out there, we still run at 5% to 6%. It's my belief right now, Meredith, that -- which we've said before, our customer spends the bulk of their wallet somewhere else before they come to me. That somewhere else is going to be where the impact is if there's a pullback in SNAP. At least, that's my view. But your point is also very well taken in that the impact will probably not come on the consumable side. It would come on the nonconsumable side. That would be my bet as where we would all feel it? Meredith Adler : And do you think that those discretionary sales are being done at the retailers that redeemed the most SNAP benefits, or is it spread out? Richard Dreiling : Yes. See, my belief is you have to remember, we're the fill-in shop. We're the place you go when you forgot your T-shirts or you forgot your socks. We're not the fashion-forward carry place. We're the place you go to when you forgot a couple of Christmas decorations or you didn't get all the Christmas lights you need. My belief would be the impact we probably felt, probably where you go for the initial sale, to begin with. Meredith Adler : Okay. And then I -- I'm sorry to keep the call going on, I just have one more question. When we think about -- I know you've said that your real estate strategy really hasn't changed at all. But I think there was kind of a goal of the company to move into more middle income areas, to the extent that you could or to be able to have more transitional areas where you served customers of multiple income levels. Is that true? And have you had success in terms of -- to the extent you know -- attracting customers from a more middle income area? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think there is -- it's fair to say that we have elevated the quality of the site that we've chosen, which would tell you that we tend -- we're getting a little closer to that middle income strata that you're talking about, Meredith. And I would tell you that the peel of the box in those particular areas where we've chosen to do that, is as strong as when we go into the lower income areas. Meredith Adler : Does that increase the potential of stores that you could open? Richard Dreiling : Someone can certainly make that leap. Yes. Mary Winn Gordon : All right. Operator, that wraps up our call from our end. Everyone on the call, thank you very much for your time and attention. I'm around all day if anyone needs anything, and I look forward to seeing you later. And thank you for your interest in Dollar General. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today is Thursday, December 5, 2013. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference. Mary Winn Gordon : Thank you, Lindsay, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com, under Investor Information, Press Releases.

This information is not a substitute for any GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Today, we plan to discuss the results of our third quarter, update you on our operating initiatives and share our store growth targets for 2014. Our third quarter sales increased 10.5% over last year to $4.4 billion, with comp store sales up 4.4%. Both traffic and average ticket increased for the 23rd consecutive quarter, with customer traffic contributing most significantly to our sales increase. As we expected, the addition of tobacco products resulted in strong customer traffic growth throughout the quarter. Consumables, which include tobacco and perishables, showed the strongest sales gains. For the second quarter in a row, we had comp sales growth on the non-consumable side of the business. Comp sales in both seasonal and home are positive, and we were pleased with our apparel performance. As part of our Phase 5 merchandising initiative to optimize square footage productivity, we reduced the selling space allocated to hanging apparel in over 4,000 stores. And in the third quarter -- excuse me, in the third quarter, and the results for meeting our expectations for both sales, and more importantly, increased profitability. October Nielsen data indicates that we continue to increase our market share of consumables in units and dollars over the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week periods. Our market share in dollars continues to grow in the high-single digits. The third quarter operating profit increased by 8% to $390 million or 8.9% of sales. Our gross profit rate decreased 61 basis points to 30.3% of sales, with the vast majority of the rate compression relating to strong sales of tobacco and refrigerated items. In addition, we leveraged SG&A expenses by 40 basis points as we continued our focus on expense control. Adjusted net income increased 10%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $0.72.  We're pleased to announce that we continued to return cash to our shareholders with an additional $200 million of share repurchases in the third quarter, and we increased our share repurchase authorization by another $1 billion, our single largest authorization to date.  Total inventories, including tobacco, which is incremental year-over-year, were up 11%, and on a per-store basis, were up 4%. We are pleased that we have begun to get our inventory growth back in line with sales growth. This is our lowest inventory growth rate since the 2012 second quarter. In October, we reached another major milestone : The grand opening of our 11,000th store here in middle Tennessee. Our third quarter results were solid in spite of an aggressive competitive environment. Starting late in the second half of the quarter, we saw increases in the competitive share of voice in both print and electronic media. As has been reported over the last week, item and price intensity increased across all channels. Before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to take the opportunity to congratulate Todd Vasos on his recent promotion to Chief Operating Officer, assuming the responsibility for store operations, merchandising and the supply chain. This is a very conventional alignment that I believe will strengthen the company and position us as well for future growth.  Since 2007, Dollar General has added almost 3,000 stores and nearly doubled in sales. I'm very proud of what we have accomplished and Todd has played a critical role in this amazing growth story. I'd also like to welcome Dave D'Arezzo, as EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer. Dave joined the Dollar General team in early November, and brings more than 30 years of retail and consumer product experience across merchandising and operations. I worked very closely with Dave at Duane Reade before I joined Dollar General in 2008, and I'm confident he's a great fit for the Dollar General team.  I will take -- I will talk more about our operating initiatives in a moment, but now I would like to turn the call over to David. David Tehle : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick covered the highlights of our third quarter sales performance, so starting with gross profit, I'll share more of the details.  Our gross profit increased 8.3% for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, gross profit decreased by 61 basis points to 30.3%. As expected, the gross margin rate was impacted by a higher mix of tobacco and perishables, which have lower initial markups. In addition, our inventory shrinkage rate was higher than last year and we incurred higher markdowns as expected. The margin compression was partially offset by a benefit from transportation efficiencies and lower fuel cost, as well as a favorable LIFO credit.  SG&A increased 8.5%, significantly lower than our sales increase. On an average per square footage basis, SG&A increased about 1%. As a percentage of sales, SG&A for the quarter was 21.4%, an improvement of 40 basis points. Contributing to this favorability was retail labor expense, which increased at a rate lower than sales. In addition, decreases in incentive compensation expense, health benefit costs and workers' compensation and general liability expenses, contributed to our SG&A leverage.  Costs that increased at a higher rate than the increase in sales include depreciation and amortization and fees associated with the increased use of debit cards. Interest expense for the quarter was $21.5 million, a decrease of $6.2 million, primarily due to lower rates resulting from the completion of our refinancing earlier this year.  Our ratio of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at 3.0. The third quarter effective tax rate was 35.6%, and includes a discrete tax benefit of approximately $6 million or $0.02 per share, relating to the reversal of reserves that were established in 2009. This reversal was associated with the expiration of the time period in which additional taxes could've been assessed.  GAAP basis net income increased 14% to $237 million in the 2013 quarter from $208 million in the 2012 quarter. And earnings per share increased 19% to $0.74 from $0.62 last year. Adjusted to exclude the discrete tax benefit in 2013 and certain items in 2012, net income increased 10.5% to $231 million and earnings per share increased 14% to $0.72. Year-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $761 million, a 10% increase over the 2012 period. Capital expenditures totaled $444 million, including $167 million for upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $103 million related to new leased stores; $86 million for distribution and transportation; $65 million for stores we purchased or built; and $17 million for information system upgrades. Year-to-date, we've open 577 new stores, and relocated or remodeled 534 stores. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new, relocated and remodeled stores, confirming our confidence in the relevance of our business model.  As Rick mentioned, we repurchased an additional $200 million of our common stock in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $420 million or 7.8 million shares, with approximately $224 million remaining under the existing authorization. This week, our board approved an additional $1 billion for share repurchases. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased 27.1 million shares, with a total cash outlay of approximately $1.3 billion and we plan to remain consistent, as well as opportunistic, in share purchases going forward. In November, we signed an agreement to sell and lease back 233 of our own stores. This transaction is expected to close in January, and result net proceeds to us in excess of $200 million, which we expect to utilize to fund incremental share repurchases in 2014.  Now let's look at our outlook for the remainder of the year, which is basically in line with our existing guidance, but refined with only one quarter to go. We expect total sales for the full year to increase 10% to 10.5%. Full year same-store sales are expected to increase 4% to 4.5%. As a reminder, there are 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will likely impact our sales. We're also cautious with regard to the competitive environment and our customers' ability to spend on discretionary items for the holidays, as many continue to face tough economic challenges and uncertainties about the future.  Operating profit, excluding the items identified in our press release, is expected to be in the range of $1.745 billion to $1.770 billion for the full year, raising the low-end and maintaining the high-end of our previous guidance. Interest expense is forecasted to be approximately $90 million. The full year 2013 effective tax rate, excluding the $6 million discreet third quarter benefit, is expected to be between 37.5% and 38%. Adjusted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $3.18 to $3.22, which is a $0.03 increase on the low-end.  For the full year, our earnings per share forecast is based on approximately 324 million weighted average diluted shares, which assumes approximately $620 million of share repurchases. Our full year operating profit and earnings per share guidance are based on adjustments consistent with those detailed in our earnings release for the year-to-date results.  Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million, that's down $25 million from our earlier guidance, primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce the cost of our new stores and remodels. We continue to plan to open approximately 650 new stores for the full year or an additional 73 stores in the fourth quarter. Remodels and relocations are expected to total approximately 550 stores for the year, or 16 in the fourth quarter.  We have a proven track record of serving our customers and generating strong returns for our shareholders, and we plan to continue to build on that record.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, David. 2013 has turned out to be another difficult year for our core customer. Consumers are challenged by ongoing high unemployment and underemployment levels, higher payroll taxes, reduction in staff benefits and uncertainties over health care insurance and insurance costs, as well as unemployment benefits. All of these factors are contributing to erosion in consumer confidence. Yet our business model, a strong value in convenient locations, is based on consistently serving these customers in good times and bad, and we will continue to help them meet these challenges going forward.  Last quarter, I updated you on our major 2013 initiatives. We had completed our 2013 goals with regard to Phase 5 merchandising evolution and our cooler expansion, enabling us to expand our assortment of refrigerated foods. We are continuing to benefit from these efforts.  As I said earlier, the addition of tobacco products has had a significant impact on growth in our customer traffic, which I continue to believe is the most important metric with regard to evaluating the success of our tobacco initiative. We're very pleased with the progress we made in building our market share in tobacco. Going forward, we expect both traffic and transaction size to build as customer awareness of tobacco products in our stores continues to grow.  Looking at the fourth quarter, there are many moving parts making the quarter extremely difficult to read. Competition has gotten more aggressive on select traffic driving items, and consumers are overly cautious. All retailers will be dealing with the significant calendar shifts as the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas has 6 fewer shopping days, pushing sales closer to the Christmas holiday.  Thanksgiving, which came a week later than the prior year, was essentially at the end of the month for our customer, a time when she is more pinched than earlier in the month. All that being said, we had a solid Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, both comping positive. I need to also remind everyone that Black Friday was on a payday this year, and would have some influence on consumer spending across all channels. We have a strong plan in place for the remainder of the holiday season and into January when our customers are restocking their pantries after the holidays. Looking forward to 2014, we're putting plans in place that build on our commitment to our 4 key operating priorities : Driving productive sales growth, enhancing gross margin, leveraging process improvements and information technology to reduce costs and strengthening and expanding Dollar General's culture of serving others. We will share more details of our 2014 initiatives when we give guidance in March. But for now, I want to share some insight into our store growth opportunities.  We're very pleased with the results of our new stores, remodels and relocations over the past several years. We have continued to evolve our traditional Dollar General store and make this small box model even more relevant. We currently have approximately 900 of our traditional stores in the new DG 13 format, which is a more convenient layout, improved store signage and a refreshed yellow and black color scheme. This design is delivering a comp lift above what we have seen with our previous remodels.  Importantly, our customers are excited about the fresh look and shop-ability of this new layout. We continue to refine our Dollar General Plus model, which is similar to our traditional store, but with wider aisles and significantly expanded coolers. The Dollar General Plus format works very well as a replacement for an existing traditional store, where customers already know and trust Dollar General and where there is also a demand for expanded refrigerated food offering.  And finally, we are continuing to test new ideas in our Dollar General Market concept. For example, in the third quarter, we added fuel pumps to one of our market stores in Alabama. So far, the store has surpassed our expectations. At the end of the third quarter, we had 11,061 stores with 81.4 million square feet of selling space in 40 states. This year, we upgraded our site selection technology in order to fine-tune the way we look at opportunities for growth and to help us better understand the long-term potential of our small box store.  Our new model now estimates more than 14,000 additional opportunities for the industry, 40% higher than our previous estimate of 10,000. The sales and returns of our new stores, relocations and remodels are strong, and we believe that reinvesting in our business through store growth remains the best use of our capital.  In 2014, we plan to open approximately 700 new stores and to relocate or remodel approximately 525 stores, resulting in square footage growth of 6% to 7%. Our real estate pipeline is nearly 100% committed, and we are ahead of where we were this time last year. We're looking forward to opening some great new stores in 2014.  In closing, I want to recognize our leadership team and over 100,000 Dollar General employees who serve our customers every day. We're in the midst of the busiest season in retail, and our customers are depending on us for convenience and Every Day Low Prices that we provide them. I want to thank all of our employees for their contributions this year, and encourage them as we embrace the opportunities and challenges of the holiday season with enthusiasm.  Mary Winn, I'll now open the call up for questions. Mary Winn Gordon : All right. Lindsay, we'll take questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler : I'll start with the sale-leaseback you're thinking about doing. I think this is the first time you've done one. Two questions about it. The first is, kind of what you're thinking about the rate that you're going to get? Is it comparable with what you do when you do a lease directly with a landlord? And then the other question would be, are there more properties that you would be able to do sale-leasebacks on? David Tehle : Yes, great questions, Meredith. I think, we're pretty consistent in terms of the rates. For competitive reasons, I don't want to state numbers out there. But, clearly, as we thought about this transaction and looking at it, we believe it's going to be accretive to Dollar General to do it. And as we said in the release, a large part of that cash will be applied to additional share repurchases. As we look in the future, it's a little too early to call whether we'll continue to do this on an ongoing basis. We spent several years buying stores back and we knew at some point, we would turn them and we would do exactly what we're doing today, have a gain, create cash and then use that to reemploy in the business, to increase the profitability of the business. So stay tuned on that one, and I would just say we'll be opportunistic as we look to the future. Meredith Adler : And then switching gears almost completely, you've talked about the competitive environment getting much more challenging. Could you talk a little bit about how you're responding, I think you talked about both media spending as well as actual prices that are being promoted. Can you talk about both of those? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I -- Meredith, I am a strong advocate of Every Day Low Price. I think when the market begins to get highly promotional, I think you're renting your sales rather than, really, driving people who are loyal to your operations. What we'll do is what we've always done, we're going to continue to focus heavily on Every Day Low Price, knowing that sooner or later the high promotional activity, sooner or later, runs out of steam. But along the way, we're not afraid to throw a few prices out there that we think will continue to help drive our already good traffic. In regards to incremental share of voice, we currently have a program that we run 2 ads in print through the course of the month. We invest basically all of electronic media back into our cost of goods, and focus on the retail. So we think we have a solid program in place that we intend to stick to. We think at the end of the day, EDLP wins and we're pretty comfortable with what our strategy is the back half of the year -- back quarter of the year. Meredith Adler : Great. And I just had one more question. You did get some benefit this quarter from lower incentive compensation. Could you just talk about why the incentive comp was lower? And whether that was a significant benefit to SG&A or margins? David Tehle : Yes, and it's predominantly SG&A where you see that. Basically, the way our incentive comp is set up, we have a budget that we set every year, at the very beginning of the year, that's approved by the board in January. And all our compensation is based off of that budget. So what this -- and it's an aggressive budget, obviously, that's set. And because we're missing that budget, we don't accrue as much compensation because we won't be paying as high of a bonus payout or what we call team share in the company at the end of the year. And yes, to answer your question, the fact that we're spelling it out here, as well as in our filings in the 10-Q, it's significant enough that we felt like we need to point that out. Meredith Adler : And it's the sales budget that's being missed? David Tehle : No, it's really profitability. It goes to the bottom line profitability of the company. Richard Dreiling : So in spite of the year we're having -- in spite of the good year we're having, it just kind of tells you that we entered the year with incredibly higher expectations. Mary Winn Gordon : [Operator Instructions] Operator : Your next question comes from line of Charles Grom with Sterne Agee. Charles Grom : Rick, could you speak to the progression of the comp in the quarter? And any thoughts on November? It sounds like it's been a little bit choppy. And then, Dave, if you could quantify what the lift was from tobacco and also what the corresponding hit was from these apparel reductions? Richard Dreiling : Yes, as I looked at -- as I look at the quarter, our sales trends, the first part of the quarter, were very solid. I think as traffic driving initiatives in regards to price started to take place. We saw our sales in October a little bit lighter than they were in August and September. However, I still want to, Chuck, bring out that every week of the quarter, we had positive comps and every period we had positive comps. So while we saw an increase in competitive activity, we still felt pretty good where we were at. November, Chuck, I think all of retail is going to be looking at a very, very choppy November and December. We chased the calendar all through the course of the month in November. I think you had Thanksgiving come a week later. I think also, we have to be careful there was a pay period Black Friday. So I think that might have spurred some results on also. But saying all that, we had a good Thanksgiving and we had a good Black Friday. But we're just -- the calendar is very hard to read. And remember what's going on here with those 6 fewer days, everything is getting pushed closer to Christmas. And so we are -- we're optimistic on our plans, but we're being real cautious as we look at the month. And David, I think you should talk about cigarettes. David Tehle : Yes, well, first, on the markdowns, the markdown -- if you remember, we had a timing issue between second and third quarter and we spelled that out that we actually had a plus last quarter from some apparel markdowns that we moved into the third quarter because of -- for weather reasons, we wanted to give the product more time to sell. And basically, those markdowns came in about where we thought they would come in. In terms of the impact, we don't -- Chuck, we don't actually -- we're not going to spell out the exact dollar amount of the basis points, but I will say that, again, they were up there. They were lower than tobacco and lower than shrink in terms of the impact that it had on the quarter. But again, they're high enough for us to be calling out. On the cigarettes around the tobacco, again, we continue to be pleased with what we're seeing there, particularly the impact on transactions, driving people to come into the stores, which we're very happy to see. And again, we're not going to be specific in terms of the impact on the comp. But again, we're pleased with what we're seeing based on our model and what we thought cigarettes would do for us. Richard Dreiling : Chuck, I'll give you one more piece of information on the tobacco. When we started the tobacco journey, 1/3 of our cigarette sales were by themselves, 1/3 were what we would call a smoke and a coke, where they would grab a cigarette and maybe a soda or a chip. And then 1/3 is where the cigarettes were actually going into a basket that was beginning to grow. We're now at the stage of the game that back 1/3 where cigarettes are going into the actual basket is now at 44%. And cigarette purchases only are declining to 26%. So we're beginning to convert the cigarette customer into a shopper. Charles Grom : And I guess that supports your optimism for continued benefits from tobacco then? Richard Dreiling : Yes. And remember, we talked, Chuck, about transactions that it drives. It's driving people into the store, then it's our job to convert it. Charles Grom : Great. And then my final question, just -- Rick, you've done a great job and so 7 [ph] improving sales per square foot back with the Phase 1 through 4 programs and on shelf heights and then more recently with Phase 5 on some of your legacy stores. When you think about the opportunities from here and the white space that you have, could you, maybe, flesh out some of your early thinkings for us? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think as we move into 2014 and beyond, it's now about SKUs and really understanding their productivity. And now what we're doing is we're beginning the process of evaluating not only those SKUs but the categories that we have in the store. And the idea here now, and my favorite example is picture frames. When I got to this chain, I mean, we had 12- to 16-foot of picture frames. We're now down to 8-foot, which has allowed us to add an additional category. And now the challenge for us is where are picture frames going to be in another year or 2? And maybe we want to get ahead of the curve and do something that's more productive now. So now the journey is about maximizing SKU productivity for the next couple of years. Operator : Next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research. John Zolidis : A question on the long-term store opportunity, raising it to 14 additional -- 14,000 additional locations for the industry from 10,000. Can you give us a little more color on what's driving that increase in the potential store count? And are you taking into account changes from what competitors are doing with their stores? Richard Dreiling : Yes, John, it's a couple of things. Number one, there's no doubt the environment is creating more of our core customer. I mean, that's number one. But number two is we have a new software program that is allowing us to literally identify the corner of such and such where we can locate a store. Historically, we have gone in, and we've had several square box -- blocks where we can go. But now, so, what happens is you have this piece of software that allows us by taking into account competitive positioning where our customer is, being able to go in and take a look at the demographics, being able to go in and look at traffic patterns, how they flow, being on the going home side, not putting yourself at risk and it just, quite frankly, has swelled to 14,000. So a lot more analytics more than just demographics and it allows us to literally pinpoint where we can go. And it's all automated, which is really fascinating. It takes all the guess work out of it. John Zolidis : And as a follow-up to that, you discussed the lower CapEx budget and it sounded like it came out of some of the spend on new stores. Can you just talk about how much it's costing you to open a new store and the efficiencies you're gaining there? David Tehle : Yes, I think -- and again, on our total budget, $25 million isn't a huge decrease when you're talking about the numbers that we're looking at. I think it's just a matter of doing a variety of things differently and driving some better procurement in terms of the vendors that we're dealing with, getting some better deals and things of that nature. So I don't think it's anything revolutionary. It's just doing the right thing every day and driving better relationships with our vendors. Richard Dreiling : And John, if I could piggyback on that, we centralized our procurement operation the back half of 2012, and we're starting to see the benefits of that as we are -- we have one piece of the organization, particularly buying things that don't relate to what the customer is actually purchasing. And then we also have an initiative in place where we're actually taking some of the costs out of our new business -- out of our new stores, which we're very pleased with. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So on the gross margin front, how should we think about this line item longer-term in the P&L algorithm? Any opportunities with shrink and on the discretionary side into next year, just kind of larger picture, how you're thinking about this line? David Tehle : Yes, I'll start and certainly Rick will jump in. I mean, as we go forward, and we've talked about this previously, we continue to believe that our private label, what we're doing in private label, as well as foreign sourcing, will continue to provide benefits to our model. Shrink, clearly, we've gone the wrong way on shrink this year and there is opportunity for that to turn overall. I think tobacco will be a negative next year because keep in mind that we only started selling cigarettes in the second quarter this year and they really started to kick in, in the June and July time frame. So in terms of some pressure, we'll be dealing with that next year, also. But I think we've got a lot of levers that we can pull long term on gross margin in terms of helping increase it and get some leverage out of it. Matthew Boss : Great. And then on the nonfood side, on the more discretionary, we've seen some more encouraging trends recently, do you guys think this is something that's sustainable? Do you think that part of this is trade-down? Or is it assortment changes that you've made? Richard Dreiling : Matt, I would actually answer it's a little bit of both. I think the trade-down customer is getting more comfortable with the quality of the products we're putting out there. I think so -- also, I think we're doing a much better job on the merchandising selection here. I have to say Todd and his team, our Christmas assortment, as an example, this year, is the best I've seen in 5 or 6 years. I think we're doing a much better job in positioning the product in the store. And I think we're doing a much better job on the labeling of the product, which makes it look a little more upscale and still having that great price in it. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : You had mentioned customer concerns over healthcare, specifically. How are you seeing that reflected in your results? And how should we be thinking about the impact of Affordable Care Act on expenses longer-term? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think, I don't have anything really definitive, where we've done any market search [ph] on it. But I think everything you read and everything you're hearing about is -- the number of customers who have had low coverage policies that are basically more catastrophic, moving into the healthcare network and finding out, while they have more complete coverage, it costs a lot more. That customer that has that catastrophic coverage, a lot of that is our customer. And they're going to be dealing with that going forward. And I think it's one of those new things that has entered into all of this, this dynamic, where people who make $50,000 or less per year are starting to deal with what I'm calling dinnertime economics, right? I mean, they sit down at that dinner table at night and, Steve, they've got -- if you make $50,000 or less per year, you've given up $1,000 worth of disposable income with the change in the payroll tax. Have high unemployment, a lot of the unemployment benefits that we're getting are in higher skilled jobs. And what I've been saying for long periods of time, my concern is underemployment, that people are going back to work, but they're making less per hour and getting less hours. I think there's uncertainty, future uncertainty over unemployment benefits and I think there's uncertainty about the cost of healthcare. And recently, we've had the introduction of the change in staff benefits. And I think, if you think about this, you have our core customer sitting at the dinner table, she still has to put dinner on the table for her family and she's wrestling with all of these things. And I think that is the value that Dollar General brings to the table and always has is that we're always there with Every Day Low Price for our customer, regardless of what's going on. In regards to the Obamacare next year, David, I'll let you [indiscernible] that. David Tehle : We're in the midst of wrapping up our open enrollment period here for healthcare coverage and clearly we will have a headwind from this in 2014, but its bouncing around on us a little bit right now, we have to see how many people sign up and at what levels they sign up on and that sort of thing. So we'll update you more on that. But like most companies in America, it will be a headwind for us next year. Stephen Grambling : And then another quick follow-up on the new distribution center that's opening. Is there any impact that we should be thinking about on the P&L, both in the near-term and then longer-term as it ramps up? David Tehle : Yes, I think in the -- generally, when we bring on a DC, there is some -- again, all this is included in our guidance that we have for this year and will be in next year's guidance when we give it. You do have some impact of inefficiencies when you start up the DC, and it takes a few months before it gets up to capacity and starts operating efficiently. So we'll have a little bit of that. But again, we're pretty good at working through that. We've shown that as we've opened DCs. As a matter of fact, the prior year we opened 2 DCs at once and worked through it pretty well overall. So -- but, yes, absolutely, there are some inefficiencies when you open up. And then, as it gets downstream, it gets more efficient. And then you get -- the real help you get is from your stem miles, you reduce your transportation costs by having this new location. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Just wanted to circle back on the implied guidance for the fourth quarter and just make sure that I'm thinking about this correctly. Is it fair to say that kind of the midpoint of the top line range is suggesting a similar comp, about 4.5% or so, for the fourth quarter, with gross margins sequentially decelerating? And just also to that, if that is the case, if you can just kind of give some of the puts and takes on gross margins in 4Q versus what we've seen the past 2 quarters. And then lastly, maybe I missed it, but did you reiterate the $600 million for buyback figure for this year? Mary Winn Gordon : Paul, it's Mary Winn. We actually said $620 million for share repurchases in total for this year. David Tehle : Yes, I'll comment on this and certainly, Rick may want to jump in. As we look at the fourth quarter, there's a lot of ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. And the potential for more promotional and competitive retail and climate that we're dealing with. And as we said at the beginning of the year, the fourth quarter is our toughest comparison. We're going to be lapping the highest quarter, particularly from a gross margin percent point of view that we had last year. The other thing we're up against, and again, this is last year, we had a $0.02 benefit in taxes from [indiscernible] because we had a retroactive impact that we took in the fourth quarter and again, we spelled that out in our press release last year when we released earnings. So I think as we look at it, probably, the best I can say is, look, we think it's prudent to be somewhat cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year. Now, I want to point out we did raise the low end of our earnings per share for the full year to $3.18 from the $3.15 that it was. And again, our range now is $3.18 to $3.22 for the full year. Paul Trussell : Okay. And then just in terms of door growth for next year, the 700 doors, is there any plans to accelerate the rollout of the Plus or the market format as a part of that? Richard Dreiling : Yes, the Plus is part of our relocation program. We will increase the number of Plus stores next year. And the Dollar General Markets, Paul, are still very much experimental for us. We want to make sure, when we're dealing with a concept that's a little more elaborate than what we do on a day out and day basis that we're doing it the right way and we're spending our time on Dollar General Market right now, thinking about new things that it doesn't have that we think it might have, like the fuel that we put in, in Alabama. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : So the addition of cigarettes and perishables, obviously, benefiting your same-store sales quite a bit, Family Dollar had a similar experience when they rolled that out a year or so ago. But it was interesting, once they reached the 1-year anniversary of cigarettes and perishables, based on their forecast, same-store sales thawed out pretty quickly. So when you think into like the second and third quarter of next year, how should we be thinking about what happens with Dollar General sales momentum, once you anniversary those 2 programs? Richard Dreiling : I actually think that's a very fair question, Dan. We're on our sixth year on the perishable journey and we continue to comp in the double-digit range for 6 years consecutively now. I think that our category management process, particularly on perishables where you're dealing with an outside vendor, is very rigorous because you have to have the right items. And as I think about what we've done in perishables over the last 6 years, we've actually evolved with what I would say would be the grocery channel and mass. I can remember when we had 1 shelf of pizzas, now we have a whole door of pizza. I've watched the evolution of more, what I would call, ready-to-eat quick serve meals, where that's gone from basically a shelf to a whole door and maybe even 1.5 doors. And I think, as you look at us, what we have historically done is taken something and continued to build on it over a period of time. In regards to the cigarette thing, my view on the cigarettes is not what it does for comp sales. It's what it does for traffic. And the fact that it brings in incremental traffic and then it's up to us, through our offering and the way we manage our stores, to turn that into a bigger basket. And again, if you think about it, if you look at our sales per square foot, if you look at our transaction growth and look at our basket growth, we have been very good on building on those for a very long period of time. So I see no reason for caution, the fact that we're lapping cigarettes. Daniel Wewer : Okay. It's just that -- one other question, on the 14,000 incremental stores for your industry, I'm assuming you're including Family Dollar and Dollar Tree, but not the drugstores? Richard Dreiling : That would be correct. I'm thinking just to the -- talking just about the dollar channel, Dan. Daniel Wewer : And so out of that 14,000, how many of those would belong to Dollar General? And then also, if you could talk about the portion of those that are going to your virgin markets in the Western states and how much would be fill-in into your legacy markets? Richard Dreiling : A fair question, Dan. The 14,000 -- I mean, that's up for grabs, right? It's our ability to get out there and get as many as we can and what I try to do is to find what the total opportunity is. And obviously, how I would look at this is if Dollar General has opened 700 stores a year, there's a lot of growth opportunity out there for a long time to come. In regards to, is it more in the markets we're in or new markets, kind of -- I would kind of like to leave that one open and what I would rather say is we're continuing to be excited about the new markets we're entering. And a piece of these are in new markets, but a piece of them are also backfill opportunities in the markets we're in. Operator : Your next question comes from line of David Mann with Johnson Rice. David Mann : If we could go back to a question about shrink, can you just let us know how the rate of increase in shrink in this quarter compared to the last couple of quarters? And given the defensive moves that you've taken, when do you expect the shrink increase to moderate, or perhaps no longer be a headwind? Richard Dreiling : Yes, the first thing I want to say, while our shrink is up, it's still way below the 2007, '08 and '09 levels. And we're making progress on our initiatives here. Our #1 priority right now, David, is to stabilize the shrink number. We will begin to cycle, in the first and second quarter, the defensive merchandising steps that we have taken. We have gone in and randomly inventoried some of those stores, and to be honest, we have seen some progress there. I don't want to declare a victory here yet. But we certainly have the plans in place. And we're hoping, as we move through the year next year, that we should see -- begin to see, not only it stabilize, but see it begin to move in our favor. David Mann : Great. In terms of the macro environment, you called out, obviously, a variety of items that are headwinds. I'm just curious with the lower gas prices that we're seeing, I mean, historically, that's been a nice tailwind for your sector. I'm just curious if -- what your thoughts are about that? And if you're hearing anything about lower gas prices when you're talking to your consumers? Richard Dreiling : We love lower gas prices because it gives our consumer more money to spend. I do think that the consumer today is incredibly value-conscious. And I think they are really and truly looking for many different ways to stretch their budget and I think the gas prices will help them do that -- lower gas prices. David Mann : And then, I'm just curious, on the fueling station test, is that something that will likely be confined only to the DG market? Or do you see a white space for that across the entire chain potentially if you like what you see? Richard Dreiling : David, that is actually a very fair question. It's a little soon to tell you that. We got one and I will tell you, it's pumping gas at the rate that a convenience store would. So we're very, very pleased with what we're seeing, but a little soon to lay that one on the table. Operator : The next question comes from line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Nemer : Two quick questions. The first is on SG&A per foot, the growth has been very low, kind of in the 1% range for a number of quarters. What's a reasonable assumption for SG&A per foot growth going forward, assuming a neutral impact from some of these transitory issues like incentive comp? And then secondly, your new store opening growth will be a lot lower this quarter than the last few fourth quarters and I'm wondering what kind of impact that might have on SG&A? David Tehle : Yes, I think the whole SG&A question really has to do with our mining for cost-reduction efforts in the company. And we continue to look for ways to take costs out, whether it be our workforce management, damages, stem miles, procurement, supplies, you name it. I mean, we're working on a whole variety of things and we always will be. Every year we're going to have a mining for cost reduction effort in the company. We like to look at it in terms of what does it take to lever SG&A and we're still locked in at that 3% to 3.5% comp in terms of leveraging SG&A. So in terms of looking at it on a square footage basis, I'd rather answer it by saying that we still see it levering at 3% to 3.5% in a normal environment. So I mean, we'll continue to work on it. We've been very pleased with how we've been able to lever it the past few quarters. We have a lot of efforts going on in the company. And again, we have a lot of levers to continue to pull on SG&A. Matt Nemer : And then in terms of the lower store growth rate, is that a significant item potentially in Q4? David Tehle : I don't think it's that significant overall. And again, we'd be comparing to the same thing for Q4 last year, consistently in terms of the leverage that we'd be seeing. Every year, our store openings are always lower in the fourth quarter. That's kind of a normal thing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners. Mark Montagna : A question on tobacco. Is it fair to view, and I know it's kind of early, but is it fair to view that tobacco maturity cycle is probably being similar to just your typical store maturity cycle? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I mean, I would think the maturity of tobacco would be like any other category, quite frankly, or you can look at it in terms of store cycle, sure. I think that -- the back half of next year it's going to be about capitalizing on that transaction growth and converting that customer. Mark Montagna : Okay. And then second question, just dealing with hanging apparel, did you face markdown pressure on that, or had you planned those 4,000 stores in advance of the third quarter? Richard Dreiling : Yes, that was all planned, Mark. That was part of our plan when we announced our initiative, the end of last year, the first of next year about the 4,200 stores. Mark Montagna : Okay. Could we see further scaling back next year? Or if you do, is it just simply fine-tuning it? And then how do you fuse [ph] those stores? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think that's a fair question. It's a little soon to tell. We're very happy with what we're seeing in this block of stores and what we're very happy is with the profitability. And I think you have to give us a little bit of time. We're going to continue to fine-tune the initiative. But we'll get back to you the first part of the year next year and let you know for sure. Mark Montagna : Were you equally happy with the performance in apparel of the other 7,000 stores? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think we -- I think the difference between the other stores and the 4,000 stores is the profitability, right? And what we're trying to do is maximize our profitability per square foot. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Brian Cullinane : This is actually Brian Cullinane on for Scott. You guys talked about an increase in the competitive environment. Just wanted to -- maybe a couple of questions on that. Has it picked up at all since the end of the quarter into Thanksgiving and into December? And are you seeing it from a particular channel or a particular competitor, that increase? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I would say the uptick in competitive activity started in October and it's about the same as it was in October. And it's spread across every channel. Brian Cullinane : Every channel, okay. Richard Dreiling : And again, I want to make sure, Brian, that I reinforce here, that we're seeing it in select items that are designed to drive traffic, like soda, for example. I don't want to lead anybody to believe that I think the market has gotten irrational, because that hasn't happened yet. Brian Cullinane : Okay, that's fair. And do you think that the competition is just -- is it more of a -- is it in response to a weaker consumer, I guess, is it the consumer, or is it that people are fighting for volumes. Any thoughts there? Richard Dreiling : Yes, well, I think the weaker consumer is part of the macro environment and everybody is fighting for sales. It's about driving traffic and that's why people are selecting these high-traffic driving items, right? So again, Brian, as you think about us, I mean, we are intently focused on Every Day Low Price. It's my belief, if you get too promotional, all you do is rent those sales for a matter of time. And we continue to be relentlessly focused on getting the best value every day to the customer. Brian Cullinane : Okay. And then in terms of, maybe just a little bit on inflation, is there any -- what do you guys see for the next few months in terms of inflation? Is there any chance with some of this competition and promotional stuff -- from other people, is there any chance of outright deflation? And what does that do to your model? Richard Dreiling : Right now, I would tell you, we have seen virtually no inflation this year and we're anticipating none next year. And in regards to the competitive activity, I mean, we're going to have to let that play out. I can't give you a view on that one. Brian Cullinane : Sure. But any view on is deflation in play? I would imagine there's probably some categories specifically that are, but... Richard Dreiling : Yes, I would look at you and tell you right now there's absolutely no indication of any deflationary pressure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So 2 things. One, discretionary relevance in 2 different areas. When you look at categories or subcategories that you're in, on the discretionary side, are there some that you shouldn't be in because it's hard to be relevant assortment wise, or share-of-voice-wise? And then secondly, this time of year, when you think about what's going on with Black Friday, getting hotter and earlier, how do you maintain a competitive share of voice this time of year, right, with mass and Best Buy and others? Or is that just going to be harder to do over time? Richard Dreiling : Yes. In regard to the discretionary question, I mean, the name of the game is SKU productivity. And what we're constantly doing, John -- we have a very, very -- under Todd's guidance, a very robust category management process. And the discretionary side, quite frankly, is all about being relevant and the advantage we have, we have a small amount of SKUs, a small SKU base, and it allows us to be a little more surgical in what we choose to promote and we can stay a little more relevant. In regards to your question about Black Friday turning into a week of Black days, which I think is quite fair, I didn't -- the first thing I would say is we're not necessarily a destination for Black Friday purchases. We are -- we're the fill-in to all that. We're the I forgot the stocking stuffer or I forgot this. We do particularly good on the consumables side during the Black Friday process. So -- and again, I still believe, as long as we stay focused to our mantra, being focused on EDLP, all of this chatter and all this noise is going to play out over time. John Heinbockel : So you think on discretionary, you can be an item merchant, pick a good apparel item, pick a good home item, and if the price is right, that makes up for breadth? Richard Dreiling : That's exactly right, in fact, by the way, that is our strategy that we've really been trying to focus on in the last 18 months. I need to have whatever the best-selling sweater is if it's blue. But we don't need the red one and the green one and the gray one and the cream one. We just sell the best one and that's the whole idea. John Heinbockel : All right. And then, I know with Todd's promotion, right, so you're going to spend incremental time on other things. What might those be? And I thought one of them might be DG Market, given your food background? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think that with Todd stepping in to spend a lot more time on the day-to-day stuff, it gives me the opportunity to spend my time thinking about broader pictures, and more importantly, where we want to be in 5 years. And rather than standing up and saying, this is exactly what I'm going to do, I would say, John, it gives me the opportunity to be a little more reflective and provide a little bit bigger direction for the company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners. Patrick McKeever : The last call, there was a question on what you thought might happen with the reductions in SNAP assistance. And I think you gave a similar response to what you just said about Black Friday, in that you're not the primary destination for that particular purchase, more of a fill-in. So now that, that has -- and the bigger guys, the grocers, would be the ones that would lose out more. With the reduction having gone through at the beginning of November, I know it was a choppy month, November, but do you feel like what you were thinking would happen has happened there, and that there hasn't been a significant impact from the reduction in food stamp assistance? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think what we thought was going to happen has happened. The bulk of that shop goes to the big-box retailers and the grocers. I mean, I will -- I do believe, Patrick, we will feel something, but it's going to be minimal compared to everybody else. And the only thing I want to be cautious about, it's one month and you've got to remember, we had Thanksgiving in there. But I would think that I'm very comfortable with what we said. Patrick McKeever : Okay, got it. And then, this doesn't come up much, but you do have an e-commerce business. So -- and you've got Cyber Week savings all week, this week, and it is -- I guess it is Cyber Week. And e-commerce, of course, is really in focus right now, as we move in to -- or as we roll through the holidays. So could you just give us an update on what you're seeing with your e-commerce operation? Is there a material impact there to same-store sales? Is it more oriented -- the purchases, are they more individuals or small businesses? Richard Dreiling : Yes, our e-commerce site has a very small base. So while we were up tremendously on that day, on Cyber Monday and this week, it's on a very small base. And Patrick, it does not affect our same-store sales number. And by the way, in relation to whether it's businesses or individuals, it tends to be more the individual. And the one thing I will say is the electronic items that we have do very well on the e-commerce side. Mary Winn Gordon : Lindsay, it's Mary Winn. We've let the call go a little bit longer, so I think we ought to just go ahead and cut it off here. I do just want to tell everyone thank you for joining us today. I am around. So if you need anything, please don't hesitate to give me or Emma Jo a call. And I look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Today, we reported results for the fourth quarter 2013 and the full year. 2013 had many successes for Dollar General, representing our 24th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. As you've heard from other retailers, the fourth quarter was a challenging time for our industry. While our sales results fell short of our expectations, we did successfully manage the business to deliver better-than-anticipated gross margin, SG&A expense control and inventory growth in line with sales growth. We also delivered earnings per share at the midpoint of our guidance range. Overall, the 3 most important factors impacting our sales in the quarter were : one, the severe winter weather that the country experienced from Thanksgiving through January; two, aggressive competitive promotions that were -- we selectively did not participate in; and three, a pullback in our core customer spending due to a number of factors, including reduced government assistance. Turning first to the weather. Across all of retail, much has been said about the weather in the fourth quarter. We experienced persistently adverse weather during the quarter that was far greater than normal. As a result, we experienced significantly reduced selling hours, driven by a combination of stores that were closed due to the inclement weather and stores that operated on reduced hours. There is no doubt the winter weather negatively impacted us across the country. When our core markets, like the Midsouth and the Southeast, get hit by severe winter storms, the communities are simply not well equipped to handle the snow and ice, and it takes a while for these markets to return to normal. As you can imagine, our distribution network was also significantly disrupted in terms of inbound, as well as outbound, freight movement. January is typically a strong period for us as customers restock on the basics. Unfortunately, the last 2 weeks of January were the most severely impacted by extreme weather across a significant portion of our markets. To sum up the weather impact, we estimate that in December, 1,000 store selling days were impacted by weather, and we estimate that 7,000 selling days were impacted in January. Another way to look at this is that 34 out of the 91 days in the quarter had a negative impact from the weather. Second, competition was and continues to be aggressive, not only in share of voice but also on the key items being advertised and the promotional pricing of these items. Promotional activity was particularly heightened during the critical selling days going into Christmas, and pricing was aggressive across all channels of retail during the fourth quarter. While we made a conscious decision to selectively participate in this arena, overall, we stayed true to our everyday low price strategy, which our customers trust and have come to depend on from us. Finally, our core customer doesn't feel she is out of the woods yet economically and continues to be cautious with her spending. All in, the record ice and snow across many of our key markets, the shortened and more promotional holiday season and the continued economic uncertainties for our core customer presented significant and greater-than-anticipated headwinds in the fourth quarter. In our third quarter earnings call in early December, we shared with you our expectation that we would be chasing the calendar during the fourth quarter due to the loss of 6 selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. With the added impact of the weather, we simply were not able to close that gap in spite of cycling our easiest comps of 2012. As you most likely have personally experienced, some of the weather issues have continued into fiscal 2014. Our sales trends, starting out so far in the first quarter, have been impacted by the continued weather volatility. But I am pleased to report that on days when mother nature is more cooperative, we are very happy with our sales performance. In spite of the quarter 4 headwinds, we remain focused on the long-term growth and health of the company and believe that we have plans in place for 2014 to control what we can control. We continue to increase our overall market share of consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week periods ending February 15 according to latest available Nielsen data. We still were able to increase both our customer traffic and average ticket for the 24th consecutive quarter, although at a slower rate. We also leveraged our SG&A expenses and generated significant cash flow from operations with an increase of more than 7%. During the fourth quarter, we've returned $200 million to shareholders through the repurchase of our common stock for a full year total of $620 million or 11 million shares. David is going to talk about the details, but I'd like to share the highlights of the year and our fourth quarter. Full year sales increased 9.2% to a record $17.5 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $220 compared to $216 a year ago. Same-store sales were up 3.3% for the year and 1.3% in the fourth quarter. Both average ticket and customer traffic were positive for the year and for the quarter. For the year, our gross margin rate decreased 69 basis points, and we leveraged SG&A, excluding certain discrete items detailed in our press release, by 31 basis points. For the quarter, our gross margin rate decreased by 58 basis points, which was somewhat better than we expected. While there are always puts and takes on our margin performance, net-net, tobacco was the largest negative impact, and we leveraged SG&A expense by 14 basis points. On the bottom line, net income in the fourth quarter increased 1.5%, with earnings per share up 4% over last year's fourth quarter. And for the year, our adjusted net income increased 6.5% to $1.04 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $3.20. Looking back, we accomplished a great deal in 2013. We hit our upwardly revised target of opening 650 new stores and exceeded our combined remodel and relocation target with 582 stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6.6%. In the fourth quarter, we opened our 12th distribution center in Bethel, Pennsylvania to help us serve our growing store base in the Northeast. On the merchandising front, we continue to innovate and maximize the sales productivity of our stores. The biggest change to our merchandising mix in 2013 was the addition of tobacco products. We completed this effort in the second quarter, and tobacco sales are continuing to have a positive impact on our sales and store traffic. A key metric is the attachment rate, and we are continuing to see this grow as 68% of our tobacco transactions include one or more additional items. In fact, 41% of tobacco transactions now include 3 or more items.  In the first half of the year, we expanded coolers in over 1,600 stores, bringing our chain average to about 12 cooler doors per store. Perishables have delivered strong growth over the course of the year. As part of our ongoing effort to maximize store productivity, we completed our Phase 5 optimization in 3,000 stores in the first half of 2013 and reallocated square footage from hanging apparel in 4,000 stores to health and beauty aids, with a focus on high-margin private brands in the third quarter. Most of these changes were in our older legacy stores, where we continue to see opportunities for growth. Looking at gross margin overall, we're very pleased with how the year progressed. Although I'm disappointed with our shrink performance for the year, we remain optimistic that the changes we implemented in 2013 will have a greater impact this year. For example, we installed defensive fixtures in about 2,600 of our higher-risk stores in the first half of the year, and we began the process of eliminating some of the less productive, higher cost items, mainly in health and beauty, later in the year. I think this is an area where we may have been both -- we may have both overestimated our customers' willingness to purchase these higher-ticket items and underestimated the risk of shrinkage. Our SKU rationalization efforts to adjust this are well underway, with more than 300 SKUs eliminated in 2013 and an additional 300 identified or already eliminated in 2014 to ensure that we meet our customers' needs while also reducing our shrink risk. From an expense reduction standpoint, we continue to benefit from the capabilities of our workforce management system. This system provides our store managers with a tool to assist them as they prioritize and manage work, allowing them to be more effective in how they manage their staff in their stores. Several work elimination initiatives were introduced in 2013 to help reduce or streamline the work in our stores. Improving efficiencies in our store has been and will continue to be a significant priority for Dollar General. This is a cross-functional initiative to remove non-value-added work and reinvesting in activities that allow our store managers and their teams to better serve our customers. For instance, we are now sorting our rolltainers by planograms to eliminate re-sorting and reduce the number of steps and rolltainer moves required to stock a shelf. We've also established a new stocking program that incorporates both training and productivity tracking.  We made further inroads with regard to hiring and developing employees. In 2013, over 60% of our management positions were filled by internal candidates. This represents continued strong improvement during the past 2 years as we've made this a high priority. As Dollar General grows, we want our employees to have the opportunity to build their careers and grow both personally and professionally with the company. We are constantly striving to fill the needs and meet the changing demands of our customers. What we saw in 2013 was that our customer needed us more than ever. With much of the economy -- excuse me, while much of the economy seems to have improved, many of our core customers are continuing to struggle, giving the well-publicized headwinds, such as reduced government benefits, continued high unemployment and underemployment, higher taxes, uncertainty around the health care costs and a reduction in unemployment benefits, just to name a few. So we are executing on our detailed plans for 2014. I think it's fair to say that we plan to reach to our -- reach out to our customer and fill her everyday needs for basic consumable merchandise. Whether we are her first stop or a regular fill-in shop, we know that having the items our customer is depending on at price points that meet her budget requirements is crucial to our success and hers. Of course, we're always looking for new items and new categories that make her life easier, so you will see some of those in 2014 as well. Top initiatives supporting our 4 operating priorities in 2014 include the following : leveraging category management; eliminating work that is non-value-added in the retail stores; continuing our mining for cost reduction program with a target of over $50 million, which allows us the ability to reinvest in the business, offset other costs or drive our profitability; the testing of a life cycle remodel program to build our brand positioning in the marketplace; continuing our focus on reducing shrink; and finally, enhancing our customer service program. We talked about our new sites, location, technology and our 2014 store growth plans in last quarter's call. We plan to open 700 new stores in 2014, and we are confident that we have substantial opportunities for store growth in both new and existing states for many years to come as our new model estimates 14,000 current opportunities for the small box value retail sector in the United States. We're very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2014, and our 2014 pipeline is full. We are excited about our plans, and I'm confident that we can meet our operating goals. We continue to be cautious regarding the economic outlook for our core customers, but we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they have come to expect from Dollar General. Now David will share a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial performance and our 2014 guidance. David Tehle : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick has reviewed the highlights of our performance, let me now take you through some of the financial details. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 31.9% of sales, a decrease of 58 basis points from last year's fourth quarter and somewhat better than our updated 2013 guidance. Sales growth of tobacco products and perishables, both of which have lower gross margins, outpaced our other categories across both consumables and non-consumables. As expected, our shrink rate increased. These margin pressures were partially offset by a favorable LIFO credit and a favorable impact of net purchase costs. Total SG&A improved by 14 basis points in the fourth quarter. As a company, we did not meet the financial performance threshold for our annual team share incentive compensation. However, we made the decision to provide a modest discretionary bonus to employees, excluding officers, who are eligible for our team share bonus plan. This reduction in incentive compensation contributed 45 basis points to SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter. Primarily as a result of our sales performance, we delevered most of our other operating expenses. Consistent with our performance throughout the year, bright spots included favorable results in workers' comp and general liability, as well as employee benefits. Interest expense was $22 million for the fourth quarter, a reduction of $5 million from last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to our debt refinancing. Our tax rate for the quarter was 37.5% compared to 35.9% in the 2012 quarter. The prior year quarter included a $6.5 million or a $0.02 per share benefit related to the first 3 quarters of 2012 for the retroactive reinstatement of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. Turning to our cash flow. We generated more than $1.2 billion of cash from operating activities for the year, an increase of over 7% year-over-year. Total capital expenditures were $538 million, including $124 million for new leased stores; $76 million for stores purchased or built by us; $112 million for distribution centers; $187 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; and $28 million for information system upgrades and technology-related projects. As of the end of the year, total inventories at cost were $2.6 billion, up 6.5% in total and up less than 1% on a per-store basis. As we had planned, we were successful in getting our inventory growth in line with our sales growth as we moved through the year. Regarding our share repurchase program, we repurchased an additional $200 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter. For the 2013 fiscal year, we repurchased $620 million or 11 million shares. So far in 2014, we have repurchased an additional 3.5 million shares or $200 million using the majority of the cash proceeds from the closing of our sale-leaseback transaction, leaving us with a remaining authorization of approximately $824 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we've repurchased 33.8 million shares, with a total return of cash to shareholders of $1.7 billion. We plan to remain consistent, as well as opportunistic, in share repurchases going forward. Now for an overview of our guidance for 2014. We expect top line sales for 2014 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall square footage is expected to grow 6% to 7%, and same-store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. With regard to expenses, we have significant headwinds in SG&A that will result in us delevering SG&A in 2014. The most significant is the planned increase in our cash incentive compensation year-over-year. In recent years, we have met or exceeded the threshold for our team share annual cash incentive plan, making 2013 an anomaly. Based on our budgeting process, bonus targets have been established for 2014, and our quarterly accrual will be based on our outlook as we move through the year. Compared to 2013, this impact is estimated to be about $35 million or $0.07 per share and an 18-basis-point headwind to SG&A. Also we're facing increased costs in SG&A due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. While we have made progress in minimizing the impact, this will likely be a headwind of about $10 million to $15 million or $0.02 to $0.03 per share and 5 to 8 basis points headwind to SG&A. As a result of our sale-leaseback transaction that closed in late January, we will be facing a modest increase in SG&A of approximately 5 basis points. The sale-leaseback will have a negative impact to both operating profit and net income. However, this project is accretive to earnings per share as we have already used the majority of the proceeds to repurchase shares. In total, these 3 SG&A expense items will likely negatively impact us by $55 million to $60 million or 28 to 30 points of SG&A deleverage in total. The anticipated earnings per share impact is about $0.09 to $0.10 for the combined incentive comp and ACA headwinds. Post-2014, we would not expect year-over-year increases of this magnitude, but rather that these costs would be normalized into our operating performance going forward. We do expect that health care costs will continue to be subject to increases depending on enrollment and our claims experience. Adjusted operating profit is forecasted to be in the range of 2% to 5% -- profit growth is forecasted to be in the range of 2% to 5%. The anticipated SG&A headwinds are impacting this growth rate by approximately 3 percentage points. We are forecasting net interest expense for the year to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million. We're committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating while managing to a leverage ratio of 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. At the same time, if circumstances in the debt and equity markets are such that we deem it prudent to temporarily increase or decrease our debt levels, we may do so. We expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 38%. We expect diluted earnings per share for the year to be $3.45 to $3.55. It's a growth rate of 8% to 11% on an adjusted basis over the $3.20 in 2013. Please keep in mind, the anticipated combined impact of incentive compensation and the Affordable Care Act is approximately $45 million to $50 million or $0.09 to $0.10 per share. This is about 3 percentage points of growth on our adjusted earnings per share. We're assuming in the range of 306 million to 307 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year, which assumes the anticipated repurchase of approximately $1.1 billion of our common stock, including what we have already completed in the first quarter. In total, this repurchase activity represents approximately 5% of our current market capitalization. 2014 capital expenditures are forecasted to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million. Specifically for the fiscal first quarter, we are forecasting a total increase in sales of 7% to 8%, same-store sales growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 to $0.74. There are several factors that are weighing on our first quarter result. As we mentioned, the adverse weather impacting sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 has continued into the first quarter this year. Gross margins will continue to be impacted by our tobacco introduction as this product category was not fully launched until the second quarter of 2013.  On a quarterly basis, the anticipated impact of the incentive compensation and ACA on earnings per share is weighted to the second half of the year due to timing year-over-year. As you build your quarterly models, for the remainder of the year, please keep in mind that we will still be facing the negative gross margin rate impact of the 2013 introduction of tobacco in Q1 and Q2. As has been the trend for the last several years, we believe our customers' discretionary spending will continue to be constrained in 2014. As our long-term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers regardless of how the economy plays out. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thanks, David. Dollar General is a strong and growing business with tremendous high-return store growth opportunities that we intend to capture. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases. My sincere appreciation goes out to more than 100,000 Dollar General employees for all they do to fulfill our mission of serving others in the more than 1.5 billion annual customer transactions. With that, Mary Winn, we'd now like to open it up for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : All right. Operator, we'll take our first question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Provided -- but I wanted to ask a question about operating income growth. Certainly, I understand that these factors, particularly the incentive comp, is very specific to 2014. But as we look beyond this upcoming year, I mean, do you -- are you stating that operating income growth can be back to at or better than top line growth going forward? David Tehle : Yes. Well, Paul, we're not giving specific guidance beyond 2014. But I did say in my prepared comments that we do think we've got some headwinds in 2014 that are -- that won't reoccur as we get out of 2014 and in 2015 and beyond. Specifically, we talked about the team share, the incentive comp being $35 million or about $0.07 a share, 18 basis points on SG&A. We talked about the Affordable Care Act. That's $10 million to $15 million or 5 to 8 basis points, $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share. And then the sale-leaseback, although it doesn't hit earnings per share, it does hit the basis points on SG&A, and that was about $10 million. So we have some discrete items here that are impacting 2014. And again, as we get beyond 2014, we see these being more normalized and not being an impact as we get into 2015 and beyond. And again, we're just not giving specific guidance beyond 2014 at this point in time. Paul Trussell : Fair enough. And then just moving to the top line. If -- in addition to the weather, it was mentioned that there's consumer headwinds, taxes, health care, et cetera, along with some competitive headwinds with Walmart and others being promotional and also trying to open up small stores. Can you just go a little bit deeper into the top line initiatives and help us be comfortable with your ability to still comp 3% to 4% in 2014? What are you are expecting from the DG remodels? And what kind of lift are you seeing as you make these planogram changes? That would -- that color would be helpful. Richard Dreiling : Yes, Paul. I'll take that one. A couple things here. First of all, our remodel, relocation and new store program continues to be as healthy as ever. Our new stores continue to open up at 85% to 90% of our average comp number. I -- fact, I looked at some real estate numbers just yesterday, reviewing the 2013 projects, and they were tracking at almost 101% of our projection, so continue to be very, very healthy. I have historically laid out on this call, all of our initiatives going forward in a lot of detail. And I've elected this year, because of the intensity of the competitive environment out there, to choose to rather come back to you and tell you how we're doing once we get them done. But I will tell you that we are focused on SKU productivity. We actually believe we can do more in 2014 with less SKUs. We've examined a lot of categories, and we have discovered there are categories we can expand and categories that we're going to contract as we move through the year. We've become highly focused on not just work simplification but work elimination in the retail stores, which will free up our store managers and district managers to be more involved in the merchandising and store standards. We are also -- which I will report on as we move through the year, have developed what we are calling out a life cycle remodel, and the majority of these stores are undersized by our current standards. They're in the 5,700 to 6,500 square feet. And these are stores that historically, we might stand up and say, \"Hey, let's relocate them,\" but they're in keeper sites now. They're in good spots. We don't have the opportunity to expand them. And we've done some experimentation of going in and working this smaller store, and it's costing us about 30% to -- 30% less to remodel them, and we're generating a return that's 25% to 40% higher. And really what this involves is going in and refreshing the store up in terms of our new decor package and then making the commitment to the right categories that are in there. Rather than trying to play in every category, really focusing on those that are most productive. And then, of course, we're going to continue to stay focused on category management. And I know, Paul, that's kind of much broader than we historically have given you, but I would rather report this year on how we're doing versus laying it out on the table upfront. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.  [Technical Difficulty] Richard Dreiling : So Peter, we missed the first part of what you were saying. Peter Keith : Sure, I'll restart. When I look at the comp guidance for Q1 in the context of the full year guide, you're guiding 2% to 3%, so the full year guide of 3% to 4% implies some acceleration. At the same time, you're going to be lapping the tobacco rollout in the second quarter. So assuming you kind of have an easy compare in the fourth quarter, but I wanted to get some comfort around how you're thinking about the acceleration quarters 2 through 4. Richard Dreiling : Yes, great question. We actually -- we're feeling very comfortable about the merchandising initiatives that are starting to roll out. We are actually getting ready to do our spring roadshow, where we could go out, Peter, and lay all those out for the store managers. We're very comfortable there. And we're also -- quite honestly, I think the competitive environment is going to settle down. And really intense competitor -- competitive environments have a habit of coming and going, and when that does happen, I believe the role of EDLP is going to be even more important than the promotional activity that we've seen recently. So -- and I also think -- I fall back to what we said in our comments, when mother nature is not interfering with what's going on, we're pleased with what we're seeing. And I know the groundhog is getting every bit they can out of seeing their shadow this year, but we think the good spring weather is coming. David Tehle : Yes. I just want to jump on the weather piece of it, that, in so far, in first quarter, we have continued to have a weather impact. And that plays a big role in how we set our guidance for the quarter. Peter Keith : Okay, very good. On the weather, certainly, you guys are going to have some disruption with closures. I was curious more on the backdrop of energy costs. Have you seen sort of an overhang in some of the cold weather-impacted markets of lower comp, as maybe the discretionary income of your customers has come down a bit? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I can tell you, if I took -- it's interesting you brought this up. We took the 1,000 store -- took the bottom 1,000 stores that were in the hardest hit in regard to temperature and compared them to 1,000 stores that were in areas that weren't as severely impacted by the weather. And Peter, the significant change in the comp -- it's significant, the difference in the comp. I attribute that to 2 things : number one, the weather. I do think that we do know that natural gas and propane are both going to be up significantly for the consumer, and we might be seeing some of those higher heating bills working their way through now. So it's a little bit of both. Operator : Your next question comes from Edward Kelly with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Judah Frommer : It's actually Judah on for Ed. Just wanted to first follow up on just the operating margin guidance. And I think even x the items that you called out, the growth is a little lower than we expected, which seems like there may be some gross margin impact that's more than we anticipated. Can you talk a little bit more, beyond tobacco, about what's going on with the gross margin? You called out kind of the macro was hurting that a little bit also. David Tehle : Yes. I'll take it off, and then, please jump in, Rick. As we look at our gross margin for the year, clearly, the first half of the year is being impacted by tobacco, particularly the first quarter, but also in the second quarter. And then as we get to the back half of the year, that mitigates. And right now, we are actually forecasting that as we get into third and fourth quarter, we should start seeing some leverage in gross margin. So I don't think there's a whole lot besides the tobacco impact to talk about here. On the first -- we talked about shrink. We see shrink improving as we go through the year. And again, that will be more second half-based than first half-based. We're still dealing with that a little bit here in the first part of the year. But besides those items, I don't think there are many other items in gross margin that would have an impact. Judah Frommer : Okay. And then just a follow-up. Can you talk a little bit about the comments out of Walmart that they're going to be expanding their small store rollout. It's currently not a huge number of stores, but there is focus on that Express format that maybe competes a little bit more with you guys. Richard Dreiling : Yes. I mean, Walmart is a fabulous competitor. There is absolutely no doubt about it. I think, though, Judah, if you look at it, their primary focus is the neighborhood store. They're talking about adding 100 Express stores, I think, this coming year, and primarily, their focus is on the neighborhood market. And we're going to open up over 700 stores. So I think we've got a significant lead here, and we'll just have to see how that one plays out. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So as we think about your model beyond 2014, is it fair to think about a 3% comp or so, flattish gross margins and a low-single-digit leverage point as kind of a baseline? Any color you can kind of give us on how to think about the model over a multiyear basis would be really helpful. David Tehle : Yes. I think I'll have to go back to my earlier comment that we know we have items in 2014, the team share, the Affordable Care Act and the sale-leaseback that are having an impact, particularly on our SG&A and our operating profit [ph] if you go to the bottom line. That should be more normalized as we get outside of 2014. But again, beyond that, we're just not giving guidance over and beyond 2014 at this point in time. Richard Dreiling : Matt, I would say is what David's calling out is spot on. I would say to you that we have a long track record, though, of really good results, so I wouldn't let 2014 influence me looking forward. Matthew Boss : Right. On the same-store sales front, the 3% to 4%, I think you -- on our math, you basically get 200 basis points just from the store opening waterfall and relocations. Just kind of trying to plug the delta between the 3% to 4% and the 2%. I guess that's some of the merchandising initiatives that you said are still to come. Richard Dreiling : That's exactly right. We call out, historically, 1.5% to 2% on the real estate program. And then the rest is what we're going to do going through the course of the year to drive traffic and sales. Matthew Boss : And then last question on the square footage front. So last call, you raised the saturation target about 40% to 14,000. Have you seen anything competitively that would relate to the availability of sites? And one thing I was wondering is would you guys consider acceleration? Is that an opportunity if a key competitor were to slow the growth for a few years here? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think the issue of accelerating our new store growth is one that David and I wrestle with all the time. We are very much into organizational capacity. And if you think about it, every year that we've been together here as a team, we've upped the number of new stores that we've opened. And what we don't want to do is get ourselves into the jam the company got itself into several years ago, where it actually had to come in and close 400 stores because in the rush to open new stores, we were more focused on quantity rather than quality. And I would rather guide open 700 stores and open them right than open 850 and be marginal. So it's something we wrestle with all the time. It's a very fair question. But right now, we're very comfortable with the number of stores we're going to open. Operator : Your next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So let me start with, strategically, when you look at the discretionary categories, right, which have struggled for a couple of years here, is -- how do you think about that business longer term in terms of -- I think you've cut back a little bit on apparel. But really thinking about getting a major change there in terms of space allocation, what you carry in terms of SKUs, maybe you cut back toys, categories that are hard to compete in beyond convenience, how you think about revitalizing that business? Or is it just a matter of the economy getting better? Richard Dreiling : Actually, John, it's a combination of both. We've said all along that we're really comfortable with the steps we've taken in non-consumables in terms of the branding, how the products position in the stores, the quality, the fact that we've been able to improve the quality and reduce the price to the consumer, and we are going to need some help with the economy. Having said that, though, Phase 5 is the perfect example of how we're looking at everything, in that we're saying that every category has to carry its own water in the store. And if you look at the fact that we have reduced hanging apparel in some areas, we are committed to getting the store balanced properly. But saying -- having said all of that, we think the non-consumables side of the business is incredibly important. We are today's general store, and getting that offering moving, we think, is incredibly important to the overall mix and to our value [ph] proposition. So we're very committed, and we're still committed to it. John Heinbockel : All right. And then 2 final things. If you -- we had talked, I think, on the last call or the one before that, maybe migrating some of the learnings from DG Market into the rest of the box, particularly something like produce. Any updated thought on that? And then, secondly, how aggressive do you think you'll be in trying -- and how much of an opportunity do you think it is going after the CVS tobacco customer? Big opportunity? Do you go after that aggressively? Or is that just kind of whatever falls into your lap happens? Richard Dreiling : Yes, 2 good questions. We continue to experiment with Dollar General Market. John, I grew up selling produce and meat, and it's pretty easy for me. But it's very difficult teaching somebody how to sell it when they're not used to selling it in terms of rotation, how you order it, how you mark it down, how you keep it fresh. And right now, I don't see a lot of movement like moving produce items into the traditional DG. I will tell you, Todd and his team have made some learnings on the perishables side, the cooler side, that we've been able to move into the traditional Dollar General stores, that are beneficial. In regards to the CVS thing, I think what happens when someone gives up a category like that, those sales just tend to go where they're going to go. I think we'll get our share of it, but I don't think it's going to be more than that. Operator : Your next question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler : I'd like to start by just talking a little bit about the gross margin. And I know there's been a bunch of questions about it, but I actually want to be a little backward-looking. And you had a very tough comparison this fourth, and clearly, shrink was a negative. The mix wasn't particularly a positive. And yet, the gross margin was much better. Can you talk about maybe what the factors were? You talked about the cost of products. But is that about global sourcing or something else? David Tehle : Yes. Our IMU was definitely better, and our net purchase cost, ultimately, was better in the quarter than we had in our original guidance forecast. And I think there are a whole variety of factors that go into that, Meredith. And quite honestly, it's a little hard to dissect and say exactly how much is due to what, but you're definitely hitting on it there. A piece of it would be a little better activity going on in our foreign sourcing. We continue to expand products that we're sourcing other places. We now do trash bags out of Thailand, crackers out of Colombia. We have $1 pasta out of Italy. We're doing some $1 lotions out of Mexico. It goes on and on. So we continue to be very, very, very innovative with what we're doing with our foreign sourcing. And then I think just the merchants and the buyers did a better job overall in terms of the -- how they were able to partner with the vendors and the types of deals that they were able to get for Dollar General. So I think it's a whole variety of things. Richard Dreiling : And I think, Meredith, I'll throw out one thing, too. I think the -- it was our feeling the environment was incredibly price competitive. And people were throwing prices during extreme weather conditions that I don't think people were going to respond to anyway because they couldn't get to the store or they'd already stocked up. And we chose not to play in that, and we focused ourselves on taking care of the inventory we had in the store. Meredith Adler : Okay. And I guess, David, back to what you were saying. Is there any reason to believe that the sort of tailwinds you have in the gross margin aren't going to continue? You didn't use up all the opportunities you had. David Tehle : We still have a lot of opportunity in our private label, our foreign sourcing and our shrink. Again, let's not forget shrink because shrink, unfortunately, has been going the other way now for several quarters. So again, we continue to work those areas. And I think the question we have, Meredith, and we've talked about this before, is how much of that do we invest in price, staying true to EDLP, driving units to the box and growing margin versus letting fall to the bottom line because we've said publicly several times that the most important thing for us is making sure we are the EDLP operator and that we continue to grow our market share. So we'll have decisions to make on those private label, sourcing, et cetera, the pluses we get there, how much of that do we let fall through and how much of it do we invest in price. Meredith Adler : Okay. And then I've got another question. You actually said something that surprised me a little bit about changes being made with the rolltainers and how -- stuff that goes in them. And I was under the impression that the rolltainers  were already sorted by aisle, and that was the whole point of having rolltainers. Is that not true? Richard Dreiling : That is 100% true, but we've taken and refined it even further, where the product actually comes out how it's laid out on the shelf. So imagine all the detergent used to show up for the detergent aisle, and now we're trying to lay the rolltainer out where it actually matches to the shelf by the planogram. Meredith Adler : Wow, that's great. And then I just have one other quick question. You did a sale-leaseback, and I believe that you have been buying -- you're doing fee development for a while now. Is there significantly more owned real estate that you would consider monetizing? And presumably, if you did -- not that you have a cash flow shortage, but that you would also use that to buy back stock? David Tehle : There are other opportunities in our real estate area to do that if we wanted to. We don't have any plans right now to capitalize on that at this point in time. So I would say just stay tuned, and it may be something that we'll do in the future as we evaluate doing incremental share buybacks. I do want to stress, when we do something like that, and we demonstrated this with what we did when we closed the deal in January, the main reason for doing that is buying back stock, taking that cash and buying back stock. And that's exactly how we funded -- the $200 million that we have already bought back in the fiscal first quarter came from that, the funds from the sale-leaseback. Operator : Your next question comes from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee. Charles Grom : So we've obviously observed some irrational pricing and promotional tactics from your friends down in Charlotte, I'm just wondering how you'd characterize the environment today. And I guess more importantly, how do you react -- I mean, to David's points a couple months ago, you guys have been great about investing in price to drive units. Do you feel like because of that activity today that you need to step up your investments to continue to accelerate the traffic in your stores? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think, Chuck, that is a very fair question. We do a lot of work on our sensitive items every month. We do a full book every quarter. And to be honest with you, the gap between me and that guy you mentioned has not narrowed at all. And I do think they have been more promotional, and I think they have publicly said they want to back out of that. I will tell you that we have responded on promotional items that we think are important to the consumer. But we're staying focused, true blue to everyday low price because we think, long term, that always wins. Charles Grom : Great. Okay, great. And then I hopped on a couple minutes late, but given the weather choppiness in the fourth quarter, I didn't know if you went through the monthly cadence throughout the quarter. And as a follow-on to that, the spread between the 1,000 good stores and the 1,000 bad stores, there's been a lot of retailers that have talked about that gap being somewhere in that 700 to 900 basis point range, the sort of delta. Is that fairly consistent with what you guys saw when you look back? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I will say this. We didn't talk about the cadence of the quarter. But I will tell you, January was the day that -- or January was the period in which the most affected days were there that we experienced. And the gap between the bottom 1,000 and the high 1,000, while we didn't call out a specific number, I will tell you it was significant. Charles Grom : Okay. And then just last question to follow on Paul's from earlier. When you do step back and you do heat maps on the productivity within the store by category, where do you feel like the biggest opportunity is to improve the sales productivity by category? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I would tell you, Chuck, probably the non-consumable side. And believe it or not, not the apparel side, but the hardware, the automotive, the stuff where we think we really can play well in. And we're pleased with the assortment. We just think we need a little bit of help -- more help from the economy. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : I wanted to follow up on the -- your answer to Peter Keith's question regarding accelerating same-store sales growth. Tobacco has been adding roughly 150 basis points to same-store sales. So taking that into account, your guidance implies comps maybe at 5% or better during the second half of the year. And yet, these non-tobacco categories have been struggling. You did indicate that you thought that the competitive pressures will be easier this year than last year. But what if that doesn't happen? What if, if anything, they become a bit more intense? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I mean -- yes, I think when I reflect back on -- we had a pretty solid quarter 2 and quarter 3. I think that I don't want to take quarter 4, where we obviously suffered severe, severe weather issues. And I think as we reflect on quarter 4, we have to remember that when the weather is bad, people don't come to Dollar General to stock up. They go to the more traditional retailer and they stock up there. And they go there for a number of reasons. Number one, we're limited in assortment, and more importantly, they can get what they want, right? There's a broader depth. You come to a Dollar General to buy sugar with another 15 or 16 people, and all of a sudden, there's no sugar. And then we don't deliver for another full week. So I don't think that you can necessarily look at everything that happened in quarter 4 and push that out going forward. I do think that tobacco, the point you're raising, is that it is adding to our comp line, and it's doing exactly what we want. We're not looking at the comp number. We're looking at the transactions it's driving. And again, if you look at the fourth quarter, we're one of very few retailers who called out the fact that we still had transaction growth. So I feel, as we move through the back half of the year, that tobacco is going to continue to do what it's been doing, deliver -- it's going to deliver transactions and then, more importantly, the attachment rate is continuing to grow. So I feel pretty solid, feel pretty good about the back half of the year, particularly when I roll in what we intend to do on the initiative side. Daniel Wewer : And then also just wanted to make sure I understood your answer regarding pricing at Family Dollar. It was, I guess, our understanding that their management believes a high-low pricing strategy was not competitive against Dollar General. And hence, they're moving to a pricing strategy very similar to yours. Do you think that makes them a stronger competitor against Dollar General? Or are you actually seeing opportunities that evolve from that transition on their part? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I mean, I -- as I look at our price -- as I look at our pricing studies that are conducted on the most sensitive items, I continue to see a gap that was very similar to what it was 5 and 6 months ago. I do think that when you -- I do think when you deviate from EDLP, it takes a while to get that notion back into the customer's head. The customer is used to coming in and getting these onetime prices, right? And then it's hard to reestablish that, \"Hey, my price of Tide is good day in and day out.\" So I don't want to really speculate on someone else's pricing strategy or what they're doing. I'm just kind of saying we're very comfortable with where we are today and where we've been. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo. Matt Nemer : So it's very tough to gauge the category performance given the weather issues. But in markets where weather wasn't or isn't a factor, do you see the spread between consumables and non-consumables growth getting narrower or wider? Richard Dreiling : I would say about the same that we've seen historically. I would not say that non-consumables is getting better, but I would also tell you it's not getting any worse. We have tobacco in there, too, Matt, which kind of distorts the consumable side. Matt Nemer : As you look at your 2014 guidance, is it fair to say that you don't have the non-consumables categories comping positive? And if not, do you think that, that's something that we could potentially see in '15 or '16? Richard Dreiling : I -- actually, we're quite bullish on the non-consumable side, and we're looking to see some solid comps on that side of the table in 2014. Matt Nemer : And then just lastly, if you look at the 2014 class of new stores, how would you characterize the mix between new and existing markets? And does anything change versus recent history? Richard Dreiling : Yes. Almost all of it will be in existing markets. We're going to add somewhere between 50 and 60 stores in California. However, we're looking at California as an existing market now. But we will probably not enter into any new markets in '14. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners. Mark Montagna : Just a question on the apparel strategy. You cut back on those 4,000 stores. Does that change your -- given the results, does that change your outlook on maybe the other 7,000 stores, perhaps cutting back there? Richard Dreiling : That's actually a very fair question. We are actually, in those 4,000 stores, very pleased with the numbers we've seen. Now those stores were more space-constrained than our traditional store. And we made the decision there, Mark, not trying to be everything to everybody on every category. So I would look at you and tell you we haven't really arrived at that conclusion yet. I will tell you as we look at apparel, so far into this quarter, we're actually -- I wouldn't say pleased, but we're seeing some rays of hope in our apparel strategy. Mark Montagna : That's good. Then just a question -- I know you don't like to comment so much on the current quarter. But what I've heard from other retailers is February was actually even more weather-impacted than January. I'm wondering if you're seeing that when I think about that, when I look at your comp guidance for the quarter, first quarter versus the fiscal year. And so I'm wondering if you're seeing the same thing. Richard Dreiling : Yes. I mean I will tell you, the first 15 days of February were very tough. I will also tell you the first 10 or 12 days of March were tough. Operator : Your last question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Actually, I had some bigger-picture questions for you. And the first one goes to the planned changes for overtime rules that I think President Obama is going to lay out today. I think they're going to increase the $24,000 threshold. How should we think about that for you guys? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I got to tell you, Scott, I haven't seen -- I've heard all kinds of speculation on it, where it's going to go, what's -- how significant that is. But I think where we are right now is we're kind of waiting to see what the president is going to do. I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that we are evaluating several scenarios and looking at what the impact is going to be. But again, I don't think it'll necessarily impact 2014, and it's going to impact everybody. And I'll tell you what I've always said to everybody on these calls. We are just a retailer, and whatever costs you can't remove from the system eventually gets passed on. Scott Mushkin : Okay, great. I may follow up with you guys off-line about that in a little more detail. I want to actually move to a second one as we're long on the call. Just wanted to understand the, as you view it, Rick, the kind of the competitive advantage of just basically the dollar business. It's all about -- it's always been about convenience but also certainly price. It seems that the price component is fading a little bit. I know you, to Meredith's question, talked a little bit about gross margin you didn't chase. But it's hard not to notice the people like Delhaize, Dow Liquids [ph], the Food Lion, their volumes are now strongly positive. And in our own proprietary pricing surveys, we don't show the dollar business necessarily generally being priced much lower than some of the other competitors out there that also offer convenience. So just like from your point of view, I mean, where does this lead? I mean it seems like everyone is kind of around the same place right now. And how does a dollar business generally fit in with this new environment? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think the competitive landscape has suddenly decided that the dollar channel is a viable channel that can't be ignored any longer, and I think there's a lot of work being done on that. I will tell you, though, at the end of the day, what we bring to the table is the true value proposition. And the beauty of our model is -- the beauty of our model is a national brand is a national brand. And we have the ability to trade in and out of brands and always have the best value in front of the customer. And I'll also tell you the work that we're going to do in 2014 is all focused around that value proposition and giving the customer even more choices on those particular items. And again, I would look at everybody and say the environment has gotten very competitively intense. That does not sustain itself for a long, long period of time. And again, I fall back to where everyday low price, every day of the week on the basic necessities that the customer needs, and I think that's going to be -- that's going to serve us well into the future. Mary Winn Pilkington : So operator, thank you very much. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Emma Jo and I are around if you have any other questions. And we look forward to speaking to you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. As we expected when we gave our first quarter outlook in March, the challenges of weather, the heightened competitive environment and the current economic environment continued to impact our sales. However, as we reported today, our first quarter sales performance proved to even be more challenging than anticipated. As we said in March, as the weather normalized, our sales trends improved. We saw a turn in our business during April, even as we take into account the Easter shift. That momentum has continued quarter-to-date. In quarter 2, we are seeing strength across both our consumables and the non-consumable categories. The impact of the inclement weather across much of the country affected each first of the month in the quarter, typically the strongest sales week, so we essentially lost the opportunity for sales across the first of each month. Although our sales performance was softer than we anticipated for the first quarter, there were several positive highlights. For example, in addition to the favorable impact of the Easter shift on the Easter-related sales, we saw an improvement in our comp sales trends across the store as we moved through April. Based on our current sales trends, I believe that we are starting to see our initiatives gain traction, albeit a little later than we had anticipated. David will provide more details on our financial results in a moment, but I want to share just a few highlights. Our net sales increased 6.8% over last year to over $4.5 billion. Same-store sales grew 1.5%. We are pleased to report that both customer traffic and average ticket increased for the 25th consecutive quarter. As expected, April was stronger than February and March for several reasons, including the shift in timing of Easter. We had a very good Easter as we saw our sell-through rates increase significantly from prior years' Easter sales. Our gross margin as a percentage of sales declined 57 basis points primarily due to the increase in the sales of lower-margin consumables, including tobacco and perishables, as a percentage of overall sales. SG&A increased by 37 basis points, primarily the result of deleverage on rent and utility costs resulting in part from our same-store sales performance, as well as additional costs incurred due to the extreme winter weather. Net income was $222 million. Earnings per diluted share was $0.72, at the low end of our guidance. We returned $800 million in cash to shareholders through the repurchase of 14.1 million shares of stock, bringing our total cash return to shareholders since the inception of our store (sic) [share] repurchase program in December of 2011 to $2.3 billion. We are maintaining our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. I'll talk more about our operating initiatives for 2014 in a moment, but now I'd like to turn the call over to David. David Tehle : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick covered the highlights of our first quarter sales performance, so I'll share more details on the rest of the results, starting with gross profit. Gross profit increased 5% for the quarter with a 57 basis point decrease in gross profit rate to 30.0% of sales. This decrease was primarily driven by the higher mix of lower-margin consumables, which includes tobacco and perishables. In addition, we incurred higher markdowns primarily due to promotional activities in consumables, which were partially offset by better initial markups. SG&A expense increased 9% to $978 million or 21.6% of sales, an increase of 37 basis points over the 2013 period. The impact of lower sales growth affected our ability to leverage our fixed costs, with rent and utilities having the most significant impact. Adverse weather also contributed to higher utility cost. As we called out in the fourth quarter, SG&A in 2014 is impacted by the sale-leaseback transaction, adding about 5 basis points in the first quarter. Decreases in workers' compensation and general liability expenses partially offset the overall increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales. As of May 2, total merchandise inventories were $2.6 billion, up 1% on a per-store basis. Over the last 5 quarters, we've made great progress in managing our inventory growth to be in line with sales growth. We are very pleased with our performance here. We generated cash from operations of $251 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $84 million, including $27 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $25 million related to new leased stores; $14 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects; $12 million for distribution and transportation; and $6 million for stores we built. Regarding our share repurchase program, as Rick mentioned, we repurchased 14.1 million shares for $800 million in the first quarter. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we've repurchased 44.5 million shares, with a total return of cash to shareholders of $2.3 billion. We currently have a remaining authorization of $223 million. Turning now to guidance. At the time of our fourth quarter earnings call in March, we provided a significant amount of detail to help you build your models. Looking forward, we continue to expect top line sales for 2014 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall square footage is expected to grow about 6% to 7%, and same-store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. While there may be some puts and takes in our operating performance, we are managing the business for the long-term benefit of the company and its shareholders. We continue to expect diluted earnings per share for the year of $3.45 to $3.55. We're committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating while managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. This quarter, we temporarily increased our debt levels based on our share repurchases in the quarter. We're anticipating that we will repurchase $1.1 billion of our common stock this fiscal year. This includes the $800 million of share repurchases completed in the first quarter. For the year, we plan to open approximately 700 new stores, and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thanks, David. I was pleased to see our overall business trends improve as the quarter progressed, and we are well positioned to achieve our 2014 objectives as we enter the second quarter. We remain focused on executing our top priorities -- top initiatives supporting our operating priorities in 2014. My goal is to share some of the insights into how we are thinking about sales and initiatives that support the projected acceleration of comp sales. First, as many of you have consistently heard from me, our disciplined category management is the foundation for our limited assortment offering and staying relevant to our customer. Today, more than ever, given the economic environment that has lingered for quite some time, affordability has now become the focus of our core customer. What affordability means to our customer today is the trade-off between price and quality that best fits her budget. At times, she is showing a greater willingness to compromise on quality or functionality to get a lower price point to stretch her money. We will never lose sight of our core customer and the trust that she places in us to help her stretch her household budget. In the first quarter alone, 49 planograms have been changed to provide more affordable items on our shelf across about 90% of our departments, making it easier for our customer not only to see great value but also to see affordability. We are leveraging the Smart & Simple private brand. Smart & Simple is a great platform that allows us to offer the lowest opening price points in categories on the shelf. The Smart & Simple brand was launched about 6 years ago to deliver affordability. Our customer recognizes that the brand is just as the name indicates and does not expect the product to be a national brand equivalent like our portfolio of other private brands, including Clover Valley, DG Health and DG Home. Smart & Simple allows us to further expand our product offerings and offer a good product at an opening price point that delivers affordability. This year alone, we will add approximately 40 new Smart & Simple products primarily across food, paper and home cleaning, including items from liquid dish soap to macaroni and cheese. This is complemented by SKU additions in key consumable categories such as food, home cleaning and paper products that are, again, focused on affordability. This includes new items that are a combination of national brands and our private brands. Given our customer's search for affordability, we have placed a renewed focus on the sweet spot for our customer across these important categories. Also, we expect to comp positive in tobacco for the year based on our customers' shopping patterns for this item. Pet food and related products is an important category for our customers. To capitalize on this trend, we implemented a new planogram with a better flow and brand-blocking. At the same time, we have a soft launch that is a complete re-branding of our private brand pet offerings, again, with a focus on opening price points and affordability. The planogram has completely -- has a completely new look and a new feel. We're already seeing some positive sales results as a result of this chain as it rolls out across the organization. We have also significantly increased the SKU assortment in the $1 to $5 price points across our non-consumable categories, including seasonal, home decor, stationery, accessories and shoes. We are not waiting on the economy to improve for our core customer as she continues to face headwinds in cost increases. Rather, we are sharpening our price points, and we expect our diligent work across categories to pay off as we move through the year. Our business is about continuous improvement. We are also committed as ever to our philosophy of everyday low price to drive traffic in units. Our customers trust our pricing, and we are committed to our brand promise of save time, save money every day. In the current promotional environment, we have begun recently and will continue to selectively and strategically invest in price in key products -- product categories that are sensitive to our customers to reinforce our value message. However, in line with the trust placed in us by our customers, these promotional activities will not be at the expense of EDLP. Later in the year, we will launch a DG digital coupon platform to accept digital-manufactured coupons and capitalize on this growing trend in retail. We have partnered with Coupons.com, the leader in digital promotions. Using this platform, we will be able to deliver individualized content such as national-manufacturer coupons and DG-exclusive offers to participating customers with the goal to drive trips and basket size. For our customers, the DG digital coupon program is flexible, personal and most importantly, incredibly easy to use. Our pilot to 1,000 stores rolls out in the next few weeks, with the national launch scheduled for completion by October. Over time, we believe this exciting program will drive shopper engagement. Turning to expense control. We are eliminating work that is non-value-added across every function in Dollar General, with a concentration on our retail operations. Improving efficiencies in our stores has been and will continue to be a significant priority for Dollar General. This is a two-pronged, cross-functional initiative to create time savings that we can reinvest to better manage our stores and service our customers. First, we are removing non-value-added work, and second, we are continuing to eliminate and streamline processes and activities in our stores. We expect these changes to allow our store managers and their teams to enhance their customer service efforts. For example, we have utilized technology to improve our tobacco ordering process and to better facilitate various personnel actions performed by our store managers, both of which provide time savings and improve our visibility to and control around these processes. The most significant ongoing work simplification effort relates to our store stocking process. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we rolled out the sorting of our rolltainers in the distribution centers by planogram to eliminate resorting at the stores and to reduce the number of steps or moves required to stock the shelves. We are now rolling out a rolltainer sort that separates promotional merchandise from core merchandise to produce efficiencies in setting promotional planograms and end caps. Throughout the year, we will have several incremental technology improvements that will help our store managers and their teams close the store faster each evening and streamline store reporting of key financial and operational information. As I mentioned earlier, we are focused on continuous improvement. As such, we are steadfastly committed to improving shrink and to utilizing the store-by-store optimized shrink level targets developed using applied predictive technology. We know we have a significant room to reduce our inventory shrink on a store-by-store basis, utilizing specific data for each store. This granular approach to controlling and reducing shrink provides us with the ability to prioritize areas for improvement. Enhancing our customer satisfaction program is another great example of Dollar General's dedication to continuous improvement. Earlier this year, we revamped our program with more actional items directly correlated to store standards in stock and the checkout experience. These new metrics give us a better view on what our customers want and value in our stores. We expect this program to benefit our customers' shopping experience and help drive sales. A true hallmark of the strength of Dollar General is our real estate processes for new stores, relocations and remodels. We are highly analytical, with a focus on driving returns. We're very pleased with the results of our new stores remodels and relocations over the past several years. We've continued to evolve our traditional Dollar General store and make this small-box model even more relevant. In 2015, we'll enter 3 new states as we introduce the traditional Dollar General store concept into Oregon, Maine and Rhode Island. These states have many communities where the Dollar General brand will resonate over time. We currently have approximately 1,400 of our traditional stores in the new DG13 format, which is more -- which is a more convenient layout, improved store stock signage and refreshed yellow and black color scheme. This design is delivering a comp lift above what we've seen with our previous remodels. Importantly, our customers are excited about the fresh look and shopability of this new layout. We continue to refine our Dollar General Plus model, which is similar to our traditional store but with wider aisles, increased shelf holding power and significantly expanded coolers. The Dollar General Plus format works very well as a replacement for an existing traditional store, where customers already know and trust Dollar General and where there's also a demand for expanded refrigerated food offerings. We will add about 100 Dollar General Plus stores to our fleet this year, primarily as a tool for relocations, as the returns are in line with the returns on a traditional Dollar General store. And finally, we're continuing to test new ideas in our Dollar General Market concept. 2014 will be another year of test-and-learn for this concept for the existing base, with 5 to 6 new stores being added, as we focus on driving sales, operating profit and returns. At the end of the first quarter, we had 11,338 stores with 83.6 million square feet of selling space in 40 states. Last year, we upgraded our site selection technology in order to fine-tune the way we look at opportunities for growth and to help us better understand the long-term potential of our small-box store. Our new model estimated more than 14,000 additional opportunities for the industry, 40% higher than our previous estimate of 10,000. Importantly, while our new model estimates our opportunities across all urbanicities, the model identified the highest improvement in opportunities in small town and rural markets. This allows us to capitalize on our strong heritage of serving others in these types of high-return markets. We've expanded our test of our life cycle remodel program to build our brand position in the marketplace as there's an opportunity to maximize sales with significantly lower capital expenditures. The life cycle remodel test focuses on our legacy stores that are smaller-footprint stores under 6,500 square feet that have not been updated in more than 7 years. The life cycle remodel improves adjacencies and planogram layout, allowing for a store that's closer to the format of our traditional Dollar General that we are building today. Additionally, the number of coolers in these stores is also being increased by 4 to 5 cooler doors each or 1,600 to 2,000 incremental cooler doors in total this year. We plan to complete 400 of these life cycle remodels in 2014, of which we've already completed more than 160 since January. These stores are already driving comparable sales with a lower capital spending requirement than a traditional remodel. Over time, we believe we have a significant base of 2,000 to 3,000 stores eligible for a life cycle remodel. The sales and returns on our new stores, relocations and remodels are strong, and we believe that reinvesting in our business through store growth remains the best use of our capital. In 2014, we are ahead of schedule to open approximately 700 new stores and to relocate or remodel approximately 500 stores in addition to the 400 life cycle remodels, resulting in square footage growth of 6% to 7%. To wrap up, we've started the second quarter with momentum. Our inventories are in good shape. Our balance sheet and cash flows are strong, and we are on track to distribute over $1 billion to our shareholders through the share repurchases in 2014. We have significant organic new store growth opportunities ahead that are high-return and play to our strength as we have built organizational capacities in our real estate function over time. I remain excited about the long-term opportunities ahead for Dollar General. My gratitude goes out to more than 103,000 Dollar General employees for all they do to fulfill our mission of serving others. With that, Mary Winn, I'd be glad to open up the lines for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : All right. Brandi, if you'll poll for questions, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli, RBC Capital. Scot Ciccarelli : Can you help provide some more color around the price investments, across what percent of the store, maybe number of SKUs? Obviously, Rick, you've been talking about for a while how it's become a much more competitive environment. So just trying to get an idea around those price investments that we're talking about, especially given the fact that your biggest competitor -- direct competitor is also talking about more price investments. Richard Dreiling : Yes, Scot, here is how we're looking at this. First off, as I look at the competitive environment, while the competitive environment is intense, it is no more intense than it was when we were in the fourth quarter. It's just kind of remains more at an elevated level. It's not like people are doing silly things out there. The second thing in regards to our major competitor out there, I think it's fair to say they're moving down towards us. I don't think there should be any worry that they're attempting to get under us. I haven't seen anything to indicate that at this time. And then in regards to the investments we're making, and I want to reiterate our commitment to EDLP, as we moved into April and into May, some of the high-traffic, high-penetration items that we've seen in the ad, we made the decision to place them in our ad also. And by the way, when I say that, a handful of items. And you can't -- our environment, you can't operate where a competitor has a better price in an ad -- when you're in the ad with the same item. So a handful of selective items across consumable categories. And again, no major change, no major change in the competitive environment and not seeing many changes at all in our price as it relates to where we are against drug, mass or grocery. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. And then Rick, you did talk about kind of private label and private label food. I mean, historically, you guys talked about there's a lot of brand sensitivity around anything that customers were going to put in or on their bodies, I think, was the phrase. Are the customers now at the point where they're becoming more interested in private label food products? Richard Dreiling : Absolutely, and that's falls to the affordability thing. The private brand, the gap we have in private brand against national brands is pretty significant. And I think, Scot, that provides a wonderful trade-down opportunity for our customers. Then you couple that with the work we're doing on SKUs that are between $1 and $5 across the store, and you're getting a pretty powerful one-two punch directed at affordability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So as we think about EBIT dollars, guidance this year is low to mid-single-digit growth. That includes the incentive and health care expense build. As we think multiyear, how do you -- do you think this is a mid-teens bottom line algorithm model? Or what's the best way to think about the P&L going forward? David Tehle : Yes, this is David. We're not giving long-term guidance at this point. But when we gave our guidance back in March, we felt it was important to point out certain specific items that were hitting the P&L that we believe were more temporary in nature, and you called out some of those. And obviously, we've put them in our press release back in March. So clearly, once you get by those items, you get into a more normalized growth rate if you look at the bottom line of Dollar General. So I think getting by those items is important in terms of understanding our story as we move forward to the future. Matthew Boss : Okay. And then as a follow-up, is sales per square foot approaching about $200 here? How would you rank the productivity opportunities going forward, and how do you see your ability to continue to march this metric higher over time? Richard Dreiling : Yes, Matt, I'll take that one. One of the metrics that I'm most proud of is where we are in square footage, sales per square foot. We've started about $163 in January of '08. We're actually at $220 now. And I believe we have -- there's still opportunity there. I can't look at you and say, hey, it's going to be $250 or $270. As we continue to refine our mix, maximize category management, believe it or not, it's one of the metrics we look at the hardest, and we still think we've got room to grow it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder of Jefferies. Daniel Binder : My question was around your initiative with regard to taking price points down. I'm just curious, based on what you've seen in April and May, if you can talk a little bit about what's happening with AUR, UPT, frequency, maybe break it down a little bit for us. And also, if you could just comment on whether these are similar-type margin items as you had before, or is that changing as well? Richard Dreiling : Yes. And first of all, I don't want anybody to think we're out there lowering a lot of prices. Our EDLP position has got us incredibly strong as it relates to our competition out there. What we have done, Dan, is taken some items in the ad and trued them up with what's going on around us, right? And again, I think it's really important that I don't want anyone to think the competitive environment has changed radically in the course of the last 1.5 quarters. Our average unit retail is slightly down, and it's driven primarily probably by a little bit of deflation that we're seeing in cereals, grain items, sugar, oil, and we don't have offsetting categories because of our limited amount of SKUs in the store to offset that. And in regards to these new items, $1 to $5, I would say, quite frankly, they probably carry margin rates that are very similar to what we normally deal with. And in some cases, sometimes, the lower-value SKUs actually carry a little more margin. Operator : Your next question comes from Edward Kelly of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : Quick question for you just I guess, maybe to start on the commentary around the comp performance. You obviously mentioned that things improved in April or May. Is there any more color you can give us there? I was just curious as to whether you're, at this point, kind of in line with the full year guidance, or do you need to still drive a continued improvement from here in order to get to that number, particularly as we think about cycling tobacco? Richard Dreiling : Let me tell you -- let me answer it this way. If I looked how I felt where I'm sitting right now in quarter 4 or quarter 1, where I was sitting in the quarter, I feel a whole lot better today. So I think we have seen improving trends the minute the weather changed, so I think we're on track. Edward Kelly : And Rick, if I remember correctly, last quarter, you talked about expecting some improvement in the promotional environment, I guess, throughout the year and how that was sort of factored into how you were thinking about things. Is that still the case, or are you now relying more on sort of like internal initiatives to... Richard Dreiling : Yes, a very fair question, Ed. I actually thought, as the weather would improve, that the promotional environment would level off, and that hasn't happened. And we've made a decision on a handful of select items where we need to do the right thing for our customer. We've done that. But the key takeaway is we have not abandoned our commitment to EDLP. I want to make sure everybody understands we are managing this thing, and I did think the promotional activity would slow down. It's not any worse, but on the same token, we're not going to wait around until it does. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : I guess one quick follow-up to Ed's question on the guidance there. I guess just to be clear, is the expectation that some of the price investments that you're making on gross margin will basically be balanced by some of the cost control initiatives you have put in place? It sounded like they're incremental to what we discussed in the fourth quarter. Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think it's fair to say that we're working on cost and working on our margin like we always have. And right now, our #1 emphasis -- our #1 priority is same-store sales growth. And we're seeing -- we started seeing a momentum shift in April, and we're intent, Steve, on keeping that moving. Stephen Grambling : And then I guess a separate question, which is one of your competitors who -- Family Dollar announced some store closings going on and also slower store growth openings. How do you think about the opportunity there from a market share standpoint and even real estate selection going forward? Richard Dreiling : Yes, really, really solid question. We look at our real estate returns every week, look at our projects. We're opening our stores in that 85% to 90% of our same-store sales base. As I look at our pro forma and how we're actually performing we're at about 101%, I believe, actually doing just a little bit better. I actually think that the slowing down of growth in our competitor will lead to better real estate values for us, hopefully, down the road because there'll be less people fighting over a site. Stephen Grambling : And in terms of the closings, do you have any sense for the market share opportunity there? Richard Dreiling : I think that they're scattered all over, and I think we're going to have -- it's kind of like CVS abandoning cigarettes. I think that's one of those things we're going to have let it play out. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : So Rick, when you joined the company, a Dollar General store averaged about $170,000 of inventory. And over the following 3 or 4 years, you grew that to about $200,000 per store, and your GMROI increased every year as well. But since 2011, another $30,000 of inventory has been added, but GMROI has dropped for 8 consecutive quarters. So I guess my question is how important is inventory productivity when you're looking at strategic plans? And then particularly, when you're looking at the changes in your private label, mix, pricing, how will that impact GMROI going forward? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think, Dan, as I look at this, I think that's, again, a really solid observation. And I think if you look over the last couple of years, in our desire to become more and more relevant, we added more and more SKUs that, quite frankly, weren't turning as fast as we thought they were going to. And I think it was about this time last year, I actually admitted not only were they not turning as fast, but they were actually creating incremental shrink. And we have begun the process now of -- we've taken now over 600 of those slower-turn items that were creating shrink. In fact, I think we're just about complete with that process. And we get it without incremental markdowns involved. Well, I got tongue-tied there for a minute. So to answer your question, I think if you go back to when I first got here, the fruit was much lower on the ground. It was easier to say we needed this and we needed this and we needed this. Now what happens as we fine-tune our mix, we're going to have to be a little more select going forward. And I think what we should see, as we add more SKUs in the $1 to $5 range, if the affordability strategy works, we should see our inventory turns increase. Daniel Wewer : Okay. And just also one follow-up, maybe for David. We normally don't give too much attention to company guidance, but I did notice that you're not providing a second quarter guidance, which is, in past quarters, you did provide upcoming guidance. Was there a reason for the omission? David Tehle : Yes, that's really not a change from the past, Dan. In first quarter -- I mean, in fourth quarter, when we were laying out guidance for the year, we did give some first quarter guidance because there were a lot of ins and outs, and it was very complicated. But if you go back since we went public in 2009, our goal was to give guidance for the full year and try to steer people to that full year guidance and, on a quarterly basis, update the full year guidance. And there may have been select time periods over the last 5 years where we'll comment on a particular quarter. And certainly, as we get through the third quarter and we're talking about the rest of year, there's only one quarter left, so by definition, we're giving quarterly guidance. But in general, we have not given quarterly guidance, and that's not our intent. Again, we'd like to have our investors focus more on the long-term opportunity with Dollar General than the individual quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from David Mann of Johnson Rice. David Mann : In terms of gross margin, I think you talked about second quarter, perhaps, getting a little bit better. The first quarter would have been the worst of the year. Given the environment and what you're doing with some pricing, do you still expect that to be the case? And any other puts and takes that you could call out would be appreciated. David Tehle : Yes, David, we're not giving specific guidance on gross margin, but let me try to help you a little bit with it. And we tried to spell this out in the fourth quarter, when we were talking about the full year and we gave a little more color on some line items. I think we still think that as we get into the back half of the year and we lap tobacco because the rollout last year ended in the June, July time frame, that we should see the comparisons get a little bit easier on the gross margin. To your point, we still haven't reached that in the second quarter, so there still is pressure, more pressure on the margin in the second quarter than what we'll see the back half of the year as we get to the third quarter and the fourth quarter. David Mann : Great. And then as a follow-up, in terms of Family Dollar, when you look at what they've done in the past quarter in terms of taking some price -- or putting through some price investments, how have your stores performed that are near the Family Dollar stores versus the other stores that you have that are not in direct competition with them? Richard Dreiling : David, I'm not seeing anything different anywhere across the chain. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Just a question regarding the food and consumable categories. Your sales growth was just under 8% this quarter, so you're clearly continuing to gain market share. But that was also the third consecutive quarter of a sequential slowdown in that growth line. I'm just hoping you can speak a little bit more about overall demand of those goods, those basic household goods, and contrast that to all the meaningful additional shelf space that's being allocated across the industry to those products. Richard Dreiling : I think, Paul, as you look at the Nielsen numbers, they would actually tell you that the pie is contracting a little bit. And it's hard to believe that people are eating less or using less detergent, but apparently, they all are at the end of the day. And in fact, we actually have market research that talks about how people are trying to stretch 1 meal into 2 by adding more starch to the product. I think -- and I literally looked at this information last night, literally looked at this last night. The new Nielsen numbers are out. And on a 4-week basis and a 12-week basis, our unit share growth and share growth are accelerating. And I take that as a sign that we are -- the mix we have in the stores, the allocation of product base, how it is on the store is still the right thing to do. Mary Winn Pilkington : Paul, does that help you? Paul Trussell : No, that's helpful. And then just to follow up, in terms of the color you're giving on gross margin, just to reiterate, in the second half of the year, as you cycle tobacco, are you comfortable, given your initiatives, that gross margins will be flat to up in the second half? David Tehle : Yes. Again, we're not giving specific guidance on what we're seeing in gross margin. But we do see it getting better than what we saw in the first half of the year, in particular, as we get to third and fourth quarter, better than what we will see in first and second quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So I was wondering, Rick, of your take on Walmart's Dollar General strategy as they're talking about it, which is to basically open up some of these Express stores next to DGs, and how the stores performed when you're seeing that activity. And is there anything that you think, as they go from a test to a full-out roll here they're going to do 100 stores this year, that you're going to need to do? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think Walmart is an outstanding competitor, I mean, the largest retailer in the United States. We have experienced Express stores where our stores -- they've been opened up against us. I can tell you, in every instance where that has happened, after 1 year, the stores are comping positive, so it's not like there's this major knockout punch here. I do think that when we take the hit when a Walmart Express opens up, it's no different than with another competitor would open up. So I could actually make an argument if I get them all and just gave you an average, it might even be less. I do think that it's -- the small-box is -- I think it's a different animal to operate in terms of the supply chain. We ship in eaches and rolltainers versus pallets and truckloads. And I think there's a lot more work there that needs to be done. I mean, albeit -- Scott, we do have a nice head start, too, if you look at 11,000 stores out there. So I think they're a great competitor. I think they've done a lot of fantastic things, but I also think -- we're going to open up 700 new stores this year. We're going to enter some new markets next year. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are. Scott Mushkin : I actually agree with some of your comments about Walmart. Fresh in Dollar General, a lot of our research suggests that the fresh trends are fairly significant and that some of these packaged food, you were talking about the Nielsen data earlier, that that maybe switch -- some people switching to fresh. How does Dollar General deal with the trend for what looks like all consumers, even low-end consumers, to buy more fresh? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think one of the things we're wrestling at is -- and I use fresh to mean also more organic, right, as well as just fresh produce and fresh meat. I do think that our customer is becoming a little more receptive to the organic and the fat free. I can tell you, Scott, when I got here 4 or 5 years ago, they actually thought that product cost more. And it probably did now, and now it's actually coming down on the retail. I do know Todd and his team are looking at that. As far as moving into true fresh, true produce, true meat, that's a little more difficult animal to manage. And the key to us has always been that 7,500 to 10,000 SKUs that are core everyday use and I think will continue to fit well with the people who are really pushing the fresh stuff. Operator : Your next question comes from Meredith Adler of Barclays. Meredith Adler : I'd like to start by just talking about stock buybacks, and I don't know whether you'll add any more, but you did borrow a bit in the first quarter to buy back stock. And as you said, it ended up with leverage that was a little bit higher. If the stock were to stay depressed, would you be willing to go beyond $1.1 billion of stock repurchases? Would you be willing to stay somewhat leveraged or push leverage up a little bit? It seems like the $800 million that you spent so far, you probably got -- did well in terms of where you bought the stock. Would you take advantage of that later in the year? David Tehle : Meredith, this is David. Our target right now today is still to buy back $1.1 billion of stock. And we have said many times that given conditions in the debt and equity markets, we can temporarily change our thoughts on that, change our debt levels. And we did so in Q1, accelerating our purchases due to what we saw in the stock price. And we believe, on a long-term basis, this is very positive for all of our shareholders, particularly our longer-term shareholders. So Rick and I continuously discuss this with our board, but as of right now, the $1.1 billion is kind of where we're locked and loaded on. Meredith Adler : Okay, great. And then sort of changing gears, these $1 to $5 items and some of the other things that you've been doing to provide a better value, an opening price point in many categories, to what extent would you say that you're getting support from vendors? To what extent are they actually coming up with ideas or being very supportive on developing products and helping to manufacture them? Is this something you guys are mostly doing on your own? Richard Dreiling : Yes, actually, Meredith, to be honest, that is combination of both. I think the affordability idea, which we will probably start hearing more about, initiated from our market research and the work that's being done here. While those are manufacturer items, they're more also what I would quantify as in-and-out items, right, like a different brand, an old brand that we are now resurrecting. So it's really a combination of both. But I will tell you, if Todd was sitting here in the room with me, he would say that the vendor community is much more receptive to this kind of thinking than they ever have been in the past. Meredith Adler : Okay. And then I just have one final question about real estate. I mean, somebody already asked you about not having as much competition for real estate from your most similar competitor. But in just more generally, what are you seeing in the real estate environment? Any pressure on rate -- rents and any shortages anywhere? Or do you just still have tons of choice? Richard Dreiling : Yes. Well, I think the signal here that's the most obvious is we're already ahead of the 2014 pipeline. We've already moved into the 2015 pipeline, which would tell you the availability of the real estate is as strong as it's been the last couple of years. I would say right now, there might be some minus upward pressure in specific pieces of the country. But overall, I would tell you the rates that we're negotiating for are very consistent with what we've got in the last couple of years. In fact, I could actually tell you we're doing better in California. Meredith Adler : That's great. I hear good things about the real estate you're picking in California. Congratulations. Richard Dreiling : Yes, we've come a long way on the California thing. We're starting to get really, really excited. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Nemer : My first question is actually on the apparel business. It looked like there was some nice sequential improvement from Q4. It's still down per foot. But I'm just wondering if you're getting traction from merchandising changes there or it some of that's driven by markdowns. Richard Dreiling : It's absolutely driven by merchandising. We are, Matt, like I said in my script, we're very pleased with what we're seeing on the non-consumable side, and you haven't heard me say that in a long time. Matt Nemer : Anything in particular in apparel that's causing that change? It's like a 9 point change Q4 to... Richard Dreiling : Yes, I would tell you, and again, I never thought I'd say this, women's hanging apparel and shoes are both doing very well. And what's happening is it's starting to drag -- the halo effect is starting to drag men's with it. Now there's been a lot of hard work done on men's, too, but we're pleased with what we're seeing. Matt Nemer : Okay. And then just secondly, the digital coupon strategy that you mentioned, how does that impact the P&L? And does it replace any circular marketing expense? Could you just explain kind of how that might play out over time? Richard Dreiling : Yes, Matt, it's all -- it's driven by manufacturer expense. It's all the FSI coupons that you historically see in the Sunday newspaper. We're going to take all of that digital. And then, of course, sooner or later, we'll probably add some DG offers along with it, but there'll be no P&L hit with the implementation of the program. Operator : Our next question comes from Chuck Grom of Sterne Agee. Charles Grom : Just looking back, Rick, part of your success since you became CEO has been the price lead and kind of adopting the Costco philosophy on everyday low price, and I think we'd all agree that that's been the right formula. And I believe some of our price work on others would show that the lead relative to FDO got pretty wide the past few years, and some studies say 3% to 7%. And I'm just -- as you look forward and as that gap begins to narrow and they get to par with you, which, I think, they're starting trying to do in some categories, how do you respond to keep that customer coming back to Dollar General, that customer you've earned over the past few years? Just how do you guys react? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think -- by the way, your call out is right on. It's about what gap is. Now why were the gaps narrowing? We still significantly have some lead here yet. But I think at the end of the day, Chuck, if that were to happen, if that were to be parity down the road, if that were to happen, it will turn into an execution game. And that will be the ability for us to conceptually take what we've got and make sure it translates its way into the store, which, I think, most people will tell you that we're very good at. And I never, never want to sell short our ability in category management and the fact that we have one of the best category management programs around, and that's how you stay relevant. It's not just having the right price. You have to have the right items at the right time at the right price, and I happen to think we're very good at that. Charles Grom : Okay, I agree. And then the follow-up with that, one for David, just when you went through the components of the guidance in March, you guided EBITDA growth of, I believe, 2% to 5%. With presumably more buybacks front end-loaded than, I think, probably most people had in their models, it would appear to be that maybe the guide of the EBIT dollar growth would be at the lower end of that range. Is that kind of how the math plays out this year for you guys, or is it still at the midpoint of that range for the year? David Tehle : Yes, I think as we look at it, Chuck, and again, we're not giving specific numbers there, but the impact, if you put in the impact of the share buyback and you put it all together, I think the range on the operating profit growth, it's still -- if you look at that, it doesn't change it all that much from what we had said previously in terms of the high end of the guidance there. So it doesn't have a significant impact on that overall. Charles Grom : Okay. And then just one more, just if I could, on new store productivity. It was, on our math, around 74%, which is a little bit lower than what you guys have been running. I didn't know if there was some late in the quarter openings that kind of maybe pushed that number down or if you were seeing something else that led it to be only 74%. Richard Dreiling : No, I mean, we historically said it's in the 85% to 90% range, and I'm pretty comfortable with that number, Chuck. Operator : Your next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So let me ask you about discretionary sales trend here. So the sequential improvement you've seen, how broad-based is that? And have we turned positive yet in discretionary comps? And do you think that -- can you consistently grow that business with the low-end consumer stressed the way they are? Richard Dreiling : The improvement that we started seeing in April and into May is broad-based across all the categories, and it's fair to say that non-consumables are running positive. Now there's puts and takes in there, but we are running positive in non-consumables. John Heinbockel : As a group. Richard Dreiling : Yes, but I would say if you look at all the categories within there, it's probably as close as it's been in a long time in terms of the boat is floating pretty evenly. And more importantly, John, it's been -- we've got a great team that's working really hard on it. It's taken us a while. I still believe the non-consumable side of the business is incredibly important to us, and I actually believe that's how we'll grow the basket long term. And I think the trouble with non-consumable stuff, with your extensive retail background, it takes a while for your initiative to gain traction, where the consumer comes in and actually sees something different, something new. And that, I think, is actually what's starting to happen. John Heinbockel : So could we actually -- or you think about -- not really to think about holiday, you think about the setup, right, the easy compare, weather, the calendar, et cetera, are you more optimistic about going in a holiday than you've been in a while, a couple of years? Richard Dreiling : I think, again, if I had Vasos with me, he would tell you the offering we have for Christmas is pretty doggone strong, and it's built around affordability. It is going to be a very interesting holiday for us. Having said that, we'll talk more about that probably as we get a little bit closer to it. John Heinbockel : And let me -- and then you didn't really talk much about tobacco attachment metrics. Have they continued to improve sequentially? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I'll give you the latest cut I've got on it, John. 31% of our cigarette purchases are cigarettes only. 27% are tobacco plus 1 or 2 items. But the big number now is 42% of tobacco purchases have 3 or more items. So it's continuing to move exactly as we projected, and should say and the basket's growing with it. John Heinbockel : I was going to say based on that, is there any clever way to get more than your fair share of the CVS customers? Or not really, you just got to -- they'll come in if you're close to their store? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think the trouble when someone gives up something like that, it's going to go a little bit of everywhere. And I think what we have do, John, is just let that play out and see what actually happens. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba of BB&T Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba : Just had a question on inventory shrink. This is the first quarter in a while that you haven't specifically called out inventory shrink as a headwind to your gross margin. So I just wanted to make sure that you are seeing inventory shrink improvements, and to the extent that you are, what is driving that? David Tehle : Yes, we didn't call it out because it wasn't significant enough to be called out. But it's still a little bit of a headwind for us as we look at shrink and where we'd like to be versus where we had planned it to be, but again, not enough to be called out as it was in some previous quarters overall. We continue to have quite an effort going on in terms of things that we're doing with our defensive merchandising, our corkscrew pegs, our anti-sweep pegs. A lot of new thoughts in terms of additional things we'll be doing, particularly when it comes to DSD and some of the more high-shrink items that we have there. So stay tuned there. So again, still not ready to declare victory there, but making progress. A little bit negative, but not enough to call out like it was in prior quarters. Richard Dreiling : Probably from a headwind to a breeze, right? Anthony Chukumba : Got it. Just to clarify then, so it's still a headwind, not as much of a headwind as it's been in the past. Is that a fair assessment? David Tehle : Yes. Again, we didn't feel the need to call it out. In the past, it was significant enough that we felt like we needed to call it out. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Feldman : I guess 1 -- 2 quick questions. One was more kind of functional. I was wondering, the digital couponing that you're going to be doing, can you give a little more color? I guess I'm not clear exactly what you're doing and how that customer is going to access that. Is it just via their phones or, I guess, computer? How is that going to work functionally? Richard Dreiling : Yes, so what happens, Joe, you can either go into the store, or you can go into our website on your laptop, and all you do is you sign in with a reference number. Most people probably put their phone number in there. And once you sign in, you opt in, you can look at the assortment of coupons and say, geez, I want these or you can just check the all box. And then what we will do is we'll download those onto your smartphone. You'll go in, check out, key in your number, and then those coupons will be subtracted from your purchases. It is pretty slick. It's kind of like a loyalty card without all the expense. Joseph Feldman : Right. And then do you guys have -- and you have enough of a database, or I guess it will build as you start the program? Richard Dreiling : Absolutely. So what will happen is we'll begin to be able to link purchases to a phone number or groups of phone numbers and be able to market against those. Joseph Feldman : Got it. And then the one last question I had, sort of bigger picture. But as you guys look at your 11,000-plus stores, can you see any differences based on, I guess, for lack of a better word, quality of the store, the demographic, like the stores that are in better markets or better demographic areas versus those that are in the weaker ones? Like do you see a range of -- are people buying different things? Are there just any subtle differences that you can share with us just to get a better sense of where the customer is at? Richard Dreiling : Joe, this is one of the most interesting businesses I have ever dealt with in that the SKU base is so limited and so narrow and so relevant that it pretty much -- it's pretty even just about everywhere, regardless of the demographic. And that's why we've been so successful, with every region in the United States historically trends positive because the model is so basic. Mary Winn Pilkington : All right, operator, that -- I think, Brandi, that will conclude our call at this point. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. I know we left a few people in the queue, so please feel free to give me a call today or Emma Joe a call. And we look forward to updating you as we move through the year. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Brandy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, August 28, 2014. This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning. Now I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Brandy, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open the call up for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.  Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2014 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2014 operating, merchandising and store growth initiatives; our share repurchase expectations; our beliefs regarding future consumer economic trends and various matters relating to our proposal to acquire Family Dollar. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2013 Form 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2014 and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call. We will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Where available, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which, I have mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. David and I will discuss the highlights of the quarter, when I -- then I will briefly address the Family Dollar proposal. For the second quarter, total sales grew 7.5% to $4.72 billion. Comp sales increased 2.1% with increases in both traffic and average ticket, extending that trend to 26 consecutive quarters. Our second quarter same-store sales began very strong, with a year-over-year increase in May of more than 3.5%. However, this growth moderated as we moved through June and July, given the competitive environment and the consumer who all -- who, although resilient in the face of economic uncertainty, remains cautious with their spending. Tobacco and perishables continue to show the strongest sales gain and sales of candy and snacks, especially carbonated beverages, was also strong. Tobacco was continuing to comp positive even as we anniversary the rollout. We're very pleased with the comp sales growth in our home and apparel categories as we continue to focus on making these departments more relevant to our customers. Our gross profit rate of 30.8% of sales was 53 basis points less than last year's second quarter.  As has been the case in the last few quarters, the competitive environment continued to be elevated during the second quarter. In response, we increased our promotional activities while maintaining our commitment to EDLP in the second quarter, resulting in higher promotional markdowns. In addition, the higher mix of tobacco and perishables impacted our year-over-year gross margin compression.  Earnings per share increased 11% to $0.83 per share. On an adjusted basis, which excludes a legal settlement in 2013, earnings per share increased 8%. We remain on track to meet the full year adjusted earnings expectations we shared with you last quarter. I'll talk more about our operating initiatives in a moment, but now I'd like to turn the call over to David. David Tehle : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. In light of the competitive environment during much of the second quarter, we managed our gross margin well and we are especially pleased with our ability to control expenses in the quarter. Our gross profit increased 6% for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, gross profit decreased by 53 basis points to 30.8%. As Rick mentioned, promotional markdowns were the most significant factor contributing to gross margin compression, in addition to the higher mix of lower-margin consumables, primarily tobacco and perishables. These factors were partially offset by higher initial markups.  The change in our year-over-year shrink rate and the LIFO adjustment were insignificant in the quarter. This is noteworthy as stabilizing our shrink performance is the first step towards ultimately improving the shrink results. SG&A expense was 21.7% of sales in the 2014 period compared to 21.9% in the 2013 period or 21.8%, excluding the $8.5 million legal settlement. Excluding the legal settlement from last year's SG&A, our SG&A rate improved slightly as a result of improved leverage on retail labor expense and a decrease in benefit costs. Rent and advertising expenses increased at a higher rate than our increasing sales. Interest expense was up $2 million from the 2013 second quarter. We had higher borrowings related to our increased share repurchases. The second quarter tax rate was 38.1% compared to last year's effective tax rate of 37.4%, with the increase relating to the expiration of various federal jobs tax credit program. On a reported basis, our net income increased 2.4% to $251 million or $0.83 per share in the 2014 quarter from $245 million or $0.75 per share in the 2013 quarter. Excluding the $8.5 million legal settlement in the 2013 second quarter, adjusted income was up slightly. Earnings per share increased 11% on a GAAP basis and 8% on an adjusted basis.  Year-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $487 million. Total capital expenditures were $191 million, including $66 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $58 million related to new leased stores, primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment; $27 million for distribution, transportation-related capital expenditures; $21 million for information system upgrades and technology-related projects; and $16 million for stores sold by the company. Year-to-date, we have opened 426 new stores and relocated or remodeled 585 stores, including over 250 of the approximately 400 planned life cycle remodels. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our newly relocated and remodeled stores.  We did not repurchase shares in the second quarter. We have approximately $223 million remaining in the existing authorization. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we've repurchased approximately $2.3 billion or 44.5 million shares of our common stock. Our share repurchase program is currently on hold as we await the outcome of our proposed transaction with Family Dollar. Looking at the balance sheet, as of August 1, total inventory were $2.79 billion, up about 4% on a per-store basis.  Turning now to guidance. Looking forward, we expect -- we continue to expect top line sales for 2014 to increase 8% to 9%. Same-store sales are now expected to increase 3.0% to 3.5%, given our trends we saw in the first half of the year. Overall, square footage is expected to grow approximately 6% to 7% and we continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year of $3.45 to $3.55, excluding any cost changes to our share repurchase estimates related to the potential FDO transaction.  As you model your earnings for the third and fourth quarter, please keep in mind that we expect stronger earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter due to the easing of the comparison. For the year, we plan to open approximately 700 new stores and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million.  With that, I will turn the call back over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thanks, David. As we have said for many quarters, driving unit sales growth is key to our strategy and we remain committed as ever to providing our customers with everyday low prices they can count on. We want to make sure that customers who walk or drive by our stores every day know that they can find nearly all of their everyday items in our small-box convenience stores. So while we would have liked stronger comp sales growth in the second quarter, we are pleased with the nice step-up in customer traffic in our stores and the way the team managed expenses.  We have seen our key initiatives, such as an increased focus on affordability, expansion of health and beauty offerings and life cycle remodels, gain traction, albeit somewhat slower than we had anticipated. In non-consumables, we have exciting work underway for the second half of the year. In the fast-growing tech area, we have expanded our cellphone offerings and accessories. For the home, our domestic department has been reset, refreshed with new product assortment, new colors, dedicated end caps and a new bath towel offering with a very attractive price point of just $2.  In addition, we are in the midst of repackaging our private brands across both select consumable and non-consumable categories. The goal of the repackaging is to enhance our customers' perception of our private brand quality and most importantly, the value for the price. We had a soft launch of certain key items in August, with very encouraging results from our consumer research. All in, we expect our sales improvement to continue as we move through the year and quarterly comparisons continue to ease. Keep in mind, our merchandising strategy is based on disciplined category management process. For the vast majority of consumable items, we sell our national brands that shoppers can find across multiple formats and channels. The vast majority of the items we sell can be found in every large-box discounter, the front end of every drugstore and grocery store and even smaller, more localized retailers. What has allowed us to be successful is our ability to pare a vast number of SKUs down to the optimal items, with only the brands, the sizes and the price points that appeal to and meet the immediate or what we refer to as fill-in needs of our customers. We are able to execute the strategy with the support of our disciplined category management process, coupled with significant distribution synergies and strong buying power, resulting from purchasing significant quantities of limited SKUs. This foundation of limited assortment and distribution efficiencies allows us to successfully compete with much larger retailers and provide our customers with everyday low prices that they can trust. Let's turn to the customer for a minute. You've heard other retailers say this, low and middle-end consumers are continuing to struggle. They have changed their buying habits. Data now suggests that, out of necessity, many folks have reduced their overall consumption and absolute unit growth across Nielsen-measured channel data supports this. While our customer always finds a way to work through difficult times, she is struggling to overcome the sustained nature of the headwind she is facing. As we move through the second half of the year, we will begin to lap headwinds that have weighed on our core customer, including concern over the government shutdown in October, uncertainties for unemployment benefits and reduced SNAP benefits.  There is no doubt that affordability remains a key focus of our core customer. We talked about our affordability initiatives in our first quarter call, so I'd like to give you a quick update. First and foremost, we are as committed as ever to our philosophy of everyday low price to drive traffic and units. We are continuing to add items under our Smart & Simple brand at entry-level price points and we continue to strategically introduce new $1 price point items in key consumable categories, such as food, home cleaning and paper products, that are focused on affordability. New items include a combination of national brands and our private brands. We currently have approximately 2,500 core $1 items in our stores, which is up 5.5% from last year. Sales of core $1 SKUs increased over 13% in the second quarter, with over 44% of customer transactions including a core $1 item. We're very pleased with our customers' response to our $1 to $5 price point assortment in our non-consumable category. These sharp price points, coupled with appealing merchandise, are enhancing the relevance of our non-consumable as evidenced by solid improvement in our home and apparel sales in the second quarter. Apparel comped positive for the first time in a year, driven by broad-based growth across ladies, men's and boys. Non-consumables are important to our sales mix as we strive to enhance our gross profit rate. We have completed the rollout of our DG digital coupon capabilities in all stores. Sign-ups for the program are going well even before our full launch planned for this quarter. We will be making a big splash with our customers in late September with the promotion entitled FAST WAY TO SAVE to drive awareness and enrollment. Over time, we believe this exciting program will drive shopper engagement.  Turning to expense control. Technology and our EZ Store process are allowing us to further eliminate work in the stores that is non-value-added and to streamline our processes. Our goal is to create time savings that we can reinvest to better manage our stores and serve our customers. Some of our most meaningful projects relate to our more efficient back-office procedures and simplification of our inventory management process. As we discussed before, continuous improvements to the distribution, center-of-store process make our EZ Store delivery system even more efficient. We are learning a great deal about our customer service perception from our updated customer satisfaction program, another great example of Dollar General's dedication to continuous improvement. We are asking our customers to give us feedback on the most important aspects of our performance : How are store standards? Are we in stock on the items they need? How is the checkout experience? These revamped metrics give us a much better view on what our customers want and the value in our stores. We expect this program to benefit our customers' shopping experience and help drive sales.  I am pleased to report that we had modestly favorable results, stabilizing our inventory shrink in the second quarter, an important first step in ultimately improving our shrink results. Shrink improvement continues to be an opportunity as we remain steadfastly committed to improving shrink and optimizing our shrink levels on a store-by-store basis. At the end of the second quarter, we had 11,535 stores with 85.2 million square feet of selling space in 40 states; of those, more than 1,800 are in our most current DG13 format, which is more convenient -- which has a more convenient layout, improved store signage and a refreshed yellow and black color scheme. Last quarter, we talked about our life cycle remodel program, which focuses on our legacy smaller-footprint stores, allowing us to improve adjacency and planogram layout in a manner more consistent with our DG13 stores. Our total remodels to date this year includes over 250 life cycle remodels, which now are performing significantly ahead of the chain on a same-store sales basis. This program helps us build our brand positioning in the marketplace as there is an opportunity to maximize sales with significantly lower capital expenditure. We remain very excited that there are approximately 14,000 untapped locations providing opportunities for organic new store growth with low risk and high returns. We opened our Bethel distribution center in the first quarter and has ramped up ahead of our expectations on all productivity metrics. This facility will continue to support our new store expansion in the Northeast. This gives us a great template to follow as we look to build our new distribution center in San Antonio, Texas. With that being said, I want to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to the 105,000 Dollar General employees as we celebrate our 75th anniversary of savings and service.  To wrap all of this up, I'd like to now turn to our proposal to acquire Family Dollar. We remain committed to what we view as a superior proposal for Family Dollar shareholders, who would receive a higher value for their shares and all-cash certainty. For Dollar General shareholders, the proposed transaction is a significant strategic opportunity to create immediate and long-lasting shareholder value. Importantly, this proposed combination would solidify Dollar General's position as the leading small-box discount retailer, allowing us to deliver convenience, greater selection and everyday low prices to customers through nearly 20,000 stores in 46 states, with sales exceeding $28 billion and over 160,000 employees.  Based on our strong track record of success in improving our own profitability since 2008, we believe we can manage the Family Dollar stores more efficiently and effectively. Additionally, although we have highly complementary business models, we believe that further refinement of the combined product offerings will add value for our customers, providing them with convenience and everyday low prices on household basics and necessities, along with a compelling assortment of non-consumable merchandise.  The cost savings and synergies from the proposed transaction will enable us to share such savings with our customers. We've done extensive analysis of the potential synergies between the 2 companies across merchandising, store operations, supply chain and administrative function. As a result of that work, we have a comprehensive and thoughtful action plan ready to put in place to capture the synergies available in this potential transaction. We believe that this proposed combination would be very well positioned for long-term revenue and earnings growth, given the anticipated $550 million to $600 million of annual run rate synergies over 3 years.  We expect the proposed transaction would be immediately accretive to earnings in the low-double digits, excluding implementation and transaction costs. While we would expect to begin to receive benefits in the first year, the synergies would be expected to ramp up consistently across the 3 years. Approximately 20% of the synergies are expected to come from improved category management and increased sales productivity across both consumables and non-consumable categories. 40% will come from gross margin expansion, from merchandise procurement and sourcing and the optimization across our supply chain to reduce stem miles. The remaining 40% would be from SG&A cost reductions, including the implementation of our rolltainer delivery method to the stores. Our plans are specific, actionable across every work stream of the business. I look forward to oversee the successful integration of these 2 companies if the transaction is completed and I am prepared to remain as CEO through May of 2016 to do so.  While much has been said about the antitrust issues, we remain confident that these issues are very manageable. We have done extensive antitrust work over the last year. The up to 700-store divestiture number that we proposed was based on extensive antitrust work in order to take the issue off the table for the Family Dollar board. We are ready and willing to share this analysis with Family Dollar and its counsel and are confident that we would be able to quickly and efficiently resolve any potential antitrust issues. We continue to carefully review our options regarding our proposal and we truly hope that Family Dollar will continue -- will come to the table to explore a tremendous opportunity for maximizing value for its shareholders. Mary Winn, I would now like to open it up for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Okay. Thank you, Rick. As a reminder, the purpose of this call is to discuss our second quarter earnings and we would appreciate if you would keep your questions limited to that topic. We will not be answering any questions regarding our proposal for Family Dollar. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Brandy, we'll now open the lines up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : I guess the first would just be on the guidance. You took down the comp range a little bit but have reiterated EPS even as you suggested gross margin pressures remain to a degree. What are some of the key puts and takes in SG&A or elsewhere that are enabling you to reiterate the EPS range? David Tehle : Yes. And again, we -- I would say we kind of trimmed it a little bit in terms of when we went from a $3 to $4 to $3 to $3.50. Definitely, we're seeing a little bit better SG&A leverage in the back half of the year than what we previously had. We also tweaked the share count a little bit. The share count is a little bit lower. And again, I don't view this as a major change, what we did on the comp side of it. Richard Dreiling : Stephen, as I'm looking at the back half of the year, the thing that I like most about quarter 2 was an acceleration of transaction growth and acceleration of unit growth. And I have always been a believer, if those 2 are moving north, sooner or later, everything else catches up. Stephen Grambling : Great. That's helpful. And then, I guess, to change gears a little bit. If you can comment a little bit on maybe what Plan B is if there is no deal and how you think about capital allocation. Recognizing that the share buyback -- or the buyback program has been suspended, as we look further out, if there isn't a deal, is there any commentary you can give us on how you will be thinking about the leverage ratio and buybacks going forward? Richard Dreiling : Stephen, very fair question. I'm not prepared to go there yet because I'm not so -- I don't want to give up on the deal yet. Stephen Grambling : All right. And then maybe if I can squeeze one other one in there, would just be your -- the better traffic. As you think about consumables and tobacco being lapped, are you still getting the same attachment rate? Or is there anything that's changing there relative to your initial expectations? Richard Dreiling : Actually, great question. And again, the attachment rate on cigarettes is exactly like it has been. And we're lapping where we were last year and our cigarettes are comping positive. So we're very excited with that strategic change in our mix. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Nemer : So the first question is, in the 10-Q, you talked to the promotional environment in the quarter and then mentioned that activity has moderated recently. So I'm just wondering if you can give a little more color on where it upticked during the quarter and kind of why we saw the spike up and back down. Richard Dreiling : Yes. I would say the competitive activity in May was pretty intense, centered around the Memorial Day holiday. We actually made the decision to hang with our Every Day Low Pricing but get into the promotional foray and that's why we had a little bit more margin pressure than we had actually anticipated. Primarily, the driver of our margin pressure in quarter 2 was promotional markdowns, which was a conscious decision that we made. As we move through June, sales begin -- the competitive environment, I would say, begin to moderate. And then it got really hot around the 4th of July. We also made a decision to play in the promotional battle around the 4th of July. As we move through July, kind of stayed kind of intense. And as we moved into August, I would say it started to slow back down and it's not nearly what it was in the Memorial Day and July 4 time frame. I would like to throw out back-to-school for us. We're having a very good back-to-school right now. Our back-to-school category, we are up 4.5% right now. In fact, this week, which is the first of the 2 really intense weeks, we're actually up over 7% in the categories that are related to back to school. And I relate that to the fact that the environment has cooled down and everyday low price has a lot more value right now. Matt Nemer : That's great to hear. And then, secondly, the retail labor leverage that you achieved in the quarter, is that more related to the rolltainer initiative? Or is it more of a tactical decision around the promotional environment? Richard Dreiling : I think it's driven primarily by the work that Greg and his team are doing on work elimination. We're doing a much better job on the EZ Store sort, which is allowing the sort to be even more relevant in relation to the proximity of the product on the rolltainer, where it is on the shelf. But I think we're doing a good job of eliminating unnecessary work and our goal, Matt, long term, is to reinvest that labor back into more selling opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stacie Rabinowitz of Consumer Edge Research. Stacie  Rabinowitz: As you're talking about -- I have 2 questions, which may be related. As you're talking about increased promotional activity, I was wondering which category is -- or within your categories, private label versus branded, where that activity might have been concentrated. And then, secondly, I thought it was interesting that you guys were talking about candy, snacks and tobacco as being some of the headlines this quarter. Those seem a little bit more discretionary than some of the other categories. And given you're talking about a pressured consumer, I was wondering if you were doing anything special for those categories that might have led to that growth. Richard Dreiling : Yes. Great question. Let me do the first one. The increased promotional activity was primarily around soda pricing. I would say probably soda pricing, bread and milk will probably be the 3 key categories. And probably, in all honesty, more on the national brand side than the private brand side. Tobacco is tobacco, but soda for us resides in candy and snacks. And that's why you would see that number rise because it's primarily driven by carbonated beverage. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna of Avondale. Mark Montagna : Last year, in the second half, drugstore has gotten very deeply promotional. Are you anticipating a repeat of that again? Or can we effectively anniversary that, that we're not going to have to worry so much? Richard Dreiling : My -- I look at the ad every day with my team -- every Monday with my team. It does appear, Mark, that things are starting to moderate. You'll see a pretty aggressive soda price once in a while. But my view right now is, as we move into the back half, that it appears to finally be getting more in the traditional sense, competitive but not elevated. Mark Montagna : Okay. And then just as a follow-up. When you were talking about competitor promotions, was that more heavily concentrated at discounters? Or was it grocery stores or drugstores or pretty evenly spread? Richard Dreiling : Yes. Great question. I would say across the board. What happens is when one channel gets hot, every other channel has to respond. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler of Barclays. Meredith Adler : A lot of my questions have been asked. But I think you guys have talked a little bit about testing unique planograms for individual stores based on sort of local demographics and demand. Is that something you've actually put in place and you're willing to talk about? Or is it too early? Richard Dreiling : Yes. It's a little early, but the primary driver of that is the life cycle store and that's the idea of going at limited square feet. So we're going in and taking out categories that aren't performing as well, expanding on the ones that are, which gives us the opportunity to add more regional or local items. The sales results on the life cycle stores, Meredith, are very good right now. We're very pleased, but a little too soon to lay it all on the table yet. Meredith Adler : And do you think, from what you're seeing there, that any of the things you've done in the life cycle remodels, whether it's the unique planograms or other things, have application to the -- maybe stores that aren't quite so small or quite so old? Richard Dreiling : Yes, absolutely. What this has allowed us to do is to experiment with different SKUs without having to make a much larger commitment. So yes, the answer is yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So Rick, I just want to get back to kind of the environment. I think you said you're off to a good start. But if you had to kind of look at the numbers and say, how much is what we're doing versus how much is just the ebb and flow of the consumer? Because it seems like they come out for events, maybe they're coming out for back-to-school, although back-to-school is very early this year and then they go back into hibernation. So I guess I'm trying to gauge -- you guys have a lot of balls in the air trying to drive your traffic and your comp. How much of it is you and how much is just the ebb and flow of the consumer that's kind of manic-depressive? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think that's a very fair question. The first thing I would say is you have to remember, we've introduced a lot of what we're calling affordable SKUs. So some of the pressure we've put on the top sales line is the fact that we're selling an item at $1 that we probably would have sold for $1.50 or even $2 a year ago. So some of that is us. And again, I always come back to, Scott, I believe this is a unit game and a transaction game and we've made a conscious decision to sell SKUs that we believe are affordable. And I think it's fair to say, too, that the customer is buying less. They are stretching that food dollar. I think they are coming out for events. I think that our performance around -- I would look at you and tell you our performance around Memorial Day and July 4 was better than it's been in several years and we were there for the consumer with the right prices. So right now, I would say, it's probably -- some of it is, maybe 50%, a change in tactic for us, where we're trying to sell lower-value SKUs and get them into that basket. And probably a good 50% is a retreat on the consumer side. Scott Mushkin : Great, that's perfect. I appreciate the color. Then I had just one more. I think you guys flagged health care as helping on the expense growth side and I was wondering how sustainable is that as we get into '15 with some more changes coming in the health care law and other things. I mean, is that something that we think we can continue to get leverage on? Or is that something that's going to fade? Richard Dreiling : Well, where we're at right now, our benefit savings -- the team here is taking a really interesting tack, in that we are really wellness focused. Even myself, I have to talk to a wellness coach once a quarter that talks to me about how much I'm exercising, what I'm eating, how I'm doing with my weight. And that program is actually going through the chain. And I think, as silly as that sounds, I think that it has actually helped us. We have seen lower enrollment. So I think those are all positive signs. It's a little soon for me to forecast 2015, but I think we've laid a lot of really good pipe here that's helping us on that line. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : So let me ask you -- start with the comp chronology. Do you think that -- the drop-off in June and July, do you think that was largely competitive driven? And I asked that because some of the categories you mentioned, seasonal looked a little disappointing, given how good your stores looked. What's your take on that? And do you think that's -- what happened there? And do you think in August, have we now kind of bounced back to where we were in May? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think as I look at the summer seasonal number, that -- yes, actually, the seasonal -- the summer seasonal was up 3.3%, 3.7%, right in that window. There are other categories in there with seasonal that dragged the total number down. So I'm actually quite pleased with what our offering was and again, a major commitment to more affordable items. We are definitely feeling very good about where we are quarter-to-date. And the most important thing -- I'm sorry, John, the most important thing is we're continuing to grow our share and we're continuing to grow our units. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that, what are you seeing early on with states that have raised minimum wage, right? California did that July 1 and then some other states. Are you yet seeing that flow through into better consumer behavior? And when do you think that will happen? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think it's a little soon yet. But I will tell you this. I mean it make sense to me that if you put more money in people's pockets, it's going to translate into more sales to us. So yes, I mean, I said it's a little soon yet and we don't have enough store representation in California to get a really big read on that yet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : Rick, in your prepared comments, you noted that your core consumer is just cutting back on purchases, given their financial situation. And that certainly seems to be evident when you look at sales trends for the industry. So with that in mind, if you're successful in improving the sales productivity in the Family Dollar stores, let's say, $40 or $50 a square foot, getting close to Dollar General standards, what kind of cannibalization would you expect to take place in that Dollar General store that may be only one shopping center away? Richard Dreiling : Dan, I really can't talk about that right now. But I will tell you, that's all been taken into our analysis. And again, we feel pretty strong about what we're bringing into the table on the deal. So I need to pass on that one for now. Daniel Wewer : But I think -- I wasn't really asking about the deal. I was just trying to -- I mean, if the industry is not growing, there -- would you think that there would be some cannibalization? Richard Dreiling : Again, I want to kind of stay away from that because it's kind of tied to the Family Dollar deal. And again, I apologize. I just don't think I should answer that right now. Daniel Wewer : Okay. Well, this may be a question you may not want to answer either. But in terms of your retirement plans and then you indicated during your prepared comments, you'd be willing to stay until May of 2016, is there a search going on right now just as a contingency if the Family Dollar situation doesn't play out the way you hope that it does? Richard Dreiling : Yes. Right now -- I think that's a very fair question. But right now, I'm very optimistic of where all this is going to go. So again, we'll get back to you on that later on, right? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : A couple of questions for you, Rick. First one is related to urban stores versus rural stores. And it is just a question about really the model of both of them. And what I was hoping you could do is try to help us understand the differences between an urban store and a rural store in terms of how does productivity look, how does -- how do margins look, how do returns look. And is there really a large structural difference between the 2 models, let's talk about you, right, for you, as we think about an urban versus a rural store? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think that's a really fair question. Our rural stores tend to do very well. They operate at a lower volume rate than the urban stores and they tend to have a lower expense structure than the urban stores. Both stores tend to carry about the same margin, in all honestly -- honesty. So net-net, the overall performance of the 2 stores tends to be about the same. I would say the only difference between the 2 formats would be -- well, actually a couple of things. Number one, shrink will be higher in an urban environment than a suburban environment and you deal with more competitive pressure in the urban environment because there tends to be more choices. But overall, at the end of the day, our performance has been typically pretty even across the board. Edward Kelly : And Rick, do you think an urban store -- whether it's inner city versus maybe like outer ring of the city, for instance, does that create a difference? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I tend to look at -- we call the ones on the outer ring satellite city. That's more of suburbia versus urban. And again, we look at that a little bit different than the urban environment and suburbia would be right in between the 2 extremes. Edward Kelly : Okay. And then second question for you is on the gross margin. Obviously, traffic is important, right? And it's your focus. If we think about the current environment as maybe a little bit of a new normal, tougher consumer, this sort of trend, warfare on how do you get that extra dollar amongst the competitors, how do we think about your gross margin over the next few years, for instance, if this is what it is, right? I mean, if this is -- is it sustainable at the current level? Or do you think that we'd be looking at sort of ongoing investment and pricing promotion? David Tehle : Yes. I think as you look at it, you have to look at the pluses and the minuses. We still have a lot of confidence in our initiatives that we've been talking about for the past few years, our private label and the things we're doing, some of the exciting things, the new items that we're adding in private label and the growth that we're seeing there. Foreign sourcing continues to be strong. It continues to be growing in terms of our focus there. We're focusing a little more on consumables and trying to be less China-centric in terms of where we're bringing items in from. And then we've mentioned shrink on this call earlier, that we're starting to see some progress there through what we're doing with technology and process and incentives. So I mean, those are all positives. Obviously, we're going to stay true to EDLP and making sure that we're driving more units through the box. And we've said this before, ultimately, that's the most important thing for us, staying true to who we are in EDLP and keeping -- growing our market share and growing the units that we're selling through the individual stores. So that will override everything else. So we have initiatives in place that we believe can help us grow margin, but ultimately, it's going to depend on staying true to EDLP and making sure we continue to grow our share. And we will sacrifice gross margin to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : I wanted to ask you a bit more on the continued introduction of the $1 items. Can you give us a sense for what percentage of those are replacing some items that are already on the shelves? Or is it strictly being additionally added? Richard Dreiling : Yes. Vince, those are all incremental SKUs. We have a category management process, where we step back -- and I shouldn't say they're incremental. Something else probably came off in another category that wasn't moving and turning as fast. But for example, in the soap set we -- or the chemical set, we would have added SKUs, taking it from somewhere else. Vincent Sinisi : Okay, okay. And then just on your $1 to $5 non-consumables -- and this is maybe a good kind of combo question with that, as well as the $1 items -- kind of what inning do you think we're in with that? Where can it go? And particularly on the $1 to $5 non-consumables, do you guys foresee any kind of change down the road in terms of mix of consumables versus non-consumables? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I would -- Vince, I would like to see the non-consumable mix start to increase. Obviously, that's where the margin is in our business and the introduction of these $1 SKUs, $5 SKUs -- I think we're going to have more $1 SKUs for Christmas this year than we have ever had. And they carry more margin, albeit you sacrifice on the top line, but you give the customer what they want. So we are working very hard to get the non-consumable mix as a percentage of sales up. Vincent Sinisi : Do you have any sense, Rick, for where ultimately that could go? Richard Dreiling : I wish I could look at you and give you a definitive number. I'd just like to see it move north of last year for a quarter. I want to start there first. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : I know it's not up there but nice growth on the discretionary category. I had a question on SG&A. I was wondering, at the beginning of the year, you guys had quantified about $45 million to $50 million of fallback in incentive comp and Affordable Care Act. I was wondering if that dynamic was still in place because your SG&A leverage is still coming in a little better than we expected. David Tehle : Yes. That dynamic is still in place. Again, if you look at this quarter that we're coming out of, we got some help from benefits, from health care, our claims being down. We talked a little bit about that. And then our workers' comp also gave us some help. So still saying what we had said earlier in the year around the impact of that team share, affordable care and then that sale leaseback that we do have on SG&A. Certainly, there may be some factors offsetting that, but those items are still out there. Peter Keith : Okay. And then, I guess, just thinking about that rolling forward. You've historically had seen 3% comp to get some leverage. It looks like that has come down even despite the headwinds. Are you now at maybe a lower run rate on where you could begin to see leverage? David Tehle : No, no. We've said 3% to 3.5% and I think 3 to 5 -- 3.5% is probably still a good number. Again, we had some things in this quarter that definitely helped us, but I wouldn't come too far off of that 3.5% that we talked about traditionally. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder of Jefferies & Co. Daniel Binder : It's good to see the 2-year comp accelerate even as you lap the cigarette introduction last year. I'm curious if you can quantify what that contributed to comps this quarter as we've lapped that initiative. Richard Dreiling : Yes. I would tell you, probably, we haven't really let that out. But the contribution to the comp is de-accelerating at a significant rate and the important thing is the comp -- that cigarettes are still comping positive. Daniel Binder : Right, okay. You mentioned earlier that the summer seasonal was strong but maybe some other areas were soft. I don't know if you had any more color around those other areas and what the opportunity might be to improve on that. Richard Dreiling : Yes. It was primarily sundries, household type items that, as we said, we're working a little bit hard on to get those going. I was pleased with apparel. I am -- I'd like to reinforce that. We had men's and ladies and children's, boys particularly, were all solid. And one of the other things, too, Dan, in -- believe it or not, in the seasonal category is magazines. And the whole magazine world is going through a significant restructuring now and we're not as in stock on that particular category of magazines and books as we have in the past. So the seasonal number is just more than just good old-fashioned summer seasonal stuff. Daniel Binder : Okay. And I don't know if you'll be willing to answer this because it is a little bit related to Family Dollar. But I was just curious, given all the work you've done on real estate, how many sort of 2-player markets would you say are out there today where you don't have another major competitor besides a Dollar store? Richard Dreiling : Yes. And again, I apologize, it's a little soon for me to be talking about those things. So all I would say is we're continuing to work and explore our options. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So I guess my question is also on the promotional environment. I mean, clearly, it's intense. It seems to be increasingly volatile, changing on what sounded like a week-by-week basis, given your comments about that. So I guess my question is what expectations have you kind of built in regarding the broader competitive environment into your guidance for the holiday season, where we know it's always a more promotional time frame? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think that as we move through the back half of the year, I think the competitive environment will be heightened, but I don't think it's going to be irrational. I think, it appears to me, people -- or someone else actually brought it up on the call. I think the activity in the consumer is more focused around certain specific events. And I think Labor Day -- and we're prepared for the intense Labor Day, but then we think, things will probably settle down for a period of time. We're ready to go for Black Friday. We've got a Christmas plan in place and I see no deviation from what we have laid out. Scot Ciccarelli : But if the environment is always more heightened around the holidays and you brought up Black Friday and obviously, Christmas after that, I mean isn't that where it's most likely to get irrational? Richard Dreiling : Yes. But I think, right now, we have a plan in place that's a little -- we've gone through 2 quarters of this. We have a plan in place now that should be able to anticipate that if it's going to happen. That's why we're pretty confident that the back half margin is going to be pretty flat to last year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Just wanted to follow up on the top line. As you did reiterate -- or you provided adjusted full year guidance for same-store sales up 3% to 3.5% after comping, I believe, a 1.8% in the first half. And with the tobacco comp still positive but decelerating, if you can just maybe help us understand which categories you expect to see the acceleration. Just maybe provide a little bit more color on the initiatives in consumables or how we should think about maybe discretionary side of the store with apparel and home just so we are more confident and comfortable with the back half. Richard Dreiling : Yes. As I'm looking at this, Paul, I expect the acceleration to be broad-based. I am particularly looking for food, chemical and paper, particularly, to begin to accelerate as we move through the back half of the year. I think that we will see comps accelerate as we move across the 2 quarters, taking into account we're up against a very soft fourth quarter last year. What is encouraging me right now is the increase in traffic and the increase in units and particularly, the increase in unit share. And why we have sacrificed some sales in order to sell more SKUs that are more affordable, we believe that the traffic is going to overcome that as we move through the quarter. The attachment rate on cigarettes continues to be at or above what we thought it was going to be. And I think we're very well positioned. I'm very excited about what we're going to do from November to January 1, in particular. And by the way, I forgot about we had the coupon program rolling out, too, which is going to allow our customer to be able to extract savings out of the newspaper without having to click coupon. And it'd be downloaded to their phone and they can use as many as they want when they get to the store. Paul Trussell : That's very helpful. Just in terms of gross margin, we have now had a few quarters in a row of contraction in the 50- to 60-basis-point range. Could you just help clarify what is embedded in the guidance in the second half? I know you're lapping tobacco so that just certainly helped, along with the private label and shrink initiatives that you spoke to. But just clarify, to what extent gross margins are expected to decline or actually turn flat to positive as we move forward to the balance of the year? David Tehle : Yes. I'll take a shot and then certainly, Rick may want to say more. We're not giving a specific number on gross margin. We do see considerable improvement from what we saw from the first half of the year and you're right, one of the big factors is lapping tobacco. We also see the back half of the year being less promotional than what we saw in the front half of the year. So that has an impact also on it. So we are anticipating significant improvement on a basis-point basis from what we saw in the first half of the year. Richard Dreiling : And I would say, too, Paul, that when I look at the margin in the second quarter particularly, a lot of that was self-inflicted by our decision to get a little more promotional, particularly on CSD, but not give up on our everyday low prices. And we did not off -- we didn't raise any prices to offset that promotional activity. And I'm actually thinking, based on what we saw with customer traffic and units, it was a wise decision. Paul Trussell : Could you at all quantify the self-infliction versus the tobacco drag to 2Q gross margins? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I would rather not do that and I apologize. Mary Winn Pilkington : We have ranked them and we've reported it in the press release as well. Richard Dreiling : Promotional activity was certainly on the top. David Tehle : Right, the highest, yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Mann of Johnson Rice. David Mann : I'm curious, when you talked about some of the affordable initiatives that you're doing, can you just clarify the margin impact of those items as you accelerate that, are they at the same IMU? Or is there some degradation there? Richard Dreiling : Yes. Good question. They actually tend to carry more margin at the end of the day. Now you've sacrificed the sales, you have to look at it a little like private brands, right? When the consumer buys a private brand, you give up some sales but you make more margin. The $1 SKUs that we've been adding are actually carrying more margin. David Mann : Okay. That's great clarification. And then on the legacy remodel program, any more commentary you can give on the kind of lift you're seeing there and the opportunity to perhaps accelerate that into '15? I mean, how much can you ramp that up? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think I would -- rather than getting into a specific, I would say the lift is significantly above the average that we are running in the chain right now. And our goal is -- we think we have up to 1,500 stores that we could do. We have 250 done. So as we move through '15, I think as this continues to play out, you'll probably, probably hear us talking about accelerating that. David Mann : And then one last question. The inventory growth coming out of the quarter, I mean, it seems like you're expecting a similar kind of comp increase to that growth, so I just want to make sure. Any additional clearance carryover versus last year that we need to think about? David Tehle : Our turns right now, the way we calculate them, are 4.8. It's the same as it's been the past 3 quarters. Total inventory increased a little over 10% on a 7.5% sales increase. We like to see that inventory increase about the same as sales. On a store basis, we were up 3.7%, 4%, somewhere in that range. Clearly, new SKUs, tobacco presentation levels, a variety of reasons. The bulk of it is core inventory. So that's kind of where we stand on inventory right now. Richard Dreiling : The other thing I'd like to throw out there, as I'm sure you guys are aware, there's an import strike scare out there and we made a conscious decision to bring some of our holiday merchandise in a little sooner. Mary Winn Pilkington : Brandy, I have it at top of the hour, so unfortunately, we're going to cut the call off now. But everyone, thank you very much for joining us. If you have any questions, Emma Jo and I are around, so please feel free to give us a call. And thank you for your time and attention today. Operator : That does conclude today's conference.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Dorothy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, December 4, 2014. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. A replay of the call will be available later today. Instructions for listening to the replay are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning.  Now I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Dorothy, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open the call up for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases. Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2014 forecasted financial result and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2014 and 2015 operating, merchandising and store growth initiatives; our beliefs regarding future consumer economic trends; and various matters relating to our proposal to acquire Family Dollar. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statement are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2013 Form 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2014, and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call. We will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Where available, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which, I had mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com.  The purpose of today's call is to discuss Dollar General's performance for the fiscal third quarter and outlook for the fiscal year. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up to your questions on those subjects. During today's Q&A, we will not discuss our proposed acquisition of Family Dollar or related matters. [Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced the results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. David and I will discuss the highlights of the quarter, then I will address our current initiatives and provide an update on where we are with the Family Dollar transaction. For the third quarter, net sales grew 7.8% to $4.72 billion. Comp store sales increased 2.8% as compared to the 2013 third quarter, with increases in both traffic and average ticket, extending that trend to 27 consecutive quarters. Our comp sales trajectory improved as we moved through the quarter, and we have seen that trend accelerate into the fourth quarter. We had a good back-to-school season, along with strong sell-through for Halloween. And importantly, we are seeing a significant step-up in comp sales as we start the fourth quarter. Momentum has built as we lap the SNAP benefit cuts in the fourth quarter of 2013, and we expect to achieve a comp sales growth of approximately 5% for the fourth quarter. Perishables and tobacco continue to be the largest contributors to same-store sales growth. Tobacco has continued to show very strong comp growth beyond its first full year anniversary. Our non-consumables were positive for the quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of improvement. We are extremely pleased with sales growth in our home and apparel categories this year. I believe our efforts on current trends and affordability in these areas have already begun to take hold with our customer. Our gross profit rate of 30.1% of sales was 18 basis points less than last year's third quarter. While this was below our expectations due to higher promotional markdowns across consumable categories and end-of-season inventory clearance, this represented a significant improvement over our recent quarterly trend. Finally, adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 10% to $0.79 per share.  We've updated our guidance to reflect performance through the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter for both sales and earnings. We continue to have a strong outlook for the fourth quarter. On the comp sales front, our initiatives, coupled with our commitment to everyday low price, continue to resonate with our customers. We kicked off the holiday season with a 3-day ad the week prior to Thanksgiving and continue to emphasize our savings over an 8-day period centered on Thanksgiving Day. We offered exclusive holiday savings across gifts, toys, electronics, clothing, decor, baking and additional categories for every holiday need. We are pleased with our customers' response to these promotional events. As we lap some of the retail challenges from the fourth quarter of 2013, we are seeing broad-based momentum build in our business. I'll talk more about our operating initiatives in a moment, but now I'd like to turn the call over to David. David Tehle : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. First, let me walk you through our gross margin performance. Gross profit increased by 7.2% as a percentage of sales and decreased by 18 basis points to 30.1% in the 2014 third quarter compared to the 2013 third quarter. Our product category with the lowest gross profit rate is consumables, and this category continues to comprise a larger portion of our net sales primarily as a result of increased sales of lower margin tobacco and perishable products. The gross profit rate decrease was also impacted by an increase in markdowns due to increased promotional and end-of-season inventory clearance activity. These factors were partially offset by higher initial markups on inventory purchases and improved inventory shrink. We recorded a LIFO provision of $2.2 million in the 2014 period compared to a LIFO benefit of $3.7 million in the 2013 period. This equates to 13 basis points of negative pressure on gross margin percentage. As compared to our forecast for gross profit, we successfully mitigated the impacts of the West Coast port slowdown and driver shortages on gross margin due in part to lower stem miles from the successful opening of our Bethel, Pennsylvania distribution center earlier this year.  SG&A expense was 21.8% of sales in the 2014 period compared to 21.4% in the 2013 period. For the third quarter 2014, SG&A expense included expenses of $8 million or 17 basis points related to our proposed acquisition of Family Dollar. The remaining 21 basis points of SG&A rate increase are attributable to increases in rents, utilities and incentive compensation expenses. Offsetting these items were convenience fees charged to customers for cash back and debit card transactions and retail labor expense, which increased at a rate lower than our increase in sales. The third quarter tax rate was 36.5% compared to last year's effective tax rate of 35.6%. Both years included benefits from the reduction of reserves that were established in 2009. These amounted to $4.7 million in the 2014 quarter and $6 million in the 2013 quarter. Excluding these adjustments, the increase in our tax rate relates to the expiration of various federal jobs tax credit programs and the impact of certain nondeductible expenses related to the proposed acquisition of Family Dollar.  Year-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $841 million. That's up $80 million from last year's 39-week period. Total capital expenditures were $289 million, including $104 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $86 million related to new leased stores primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment; $36 million for distribution and transportation-related capital expenditures; $29 million for stores built by the company; and $28 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. Our share repurchase program is on hold as we await the outcome of our proposed transaction with Family Dollar.  Turning now to guidance. Top line sales for the full year 2014 are expected to increase approximately 8%, at the low end of our previous guidance range, and same-store sales are now expected to increase at or slightly below the low end of our previous range of 3.0% to 3.5%, with same-store sales growth of approximately 5% forecast for the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year to be in the middle of our previous full year adjusted earnings per share range of $3.45 to $3.55. This excludes any cost related to the potential FDO transaction. In addition, it assumes no additional share repurchases in the fourth quarter. It does assume the reinstatement of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit back to the beginning of the year, which has always been included in our guidance for our effective tax rate for the year. The impact of the tax credit is approximately $0.04 per share. For the year, we're on track to open approximately 700 new stores, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million, which is down from our earlier expectations due primarily to the timing of the build-out of our new San Antonio, Texas distribution center and lower overall cost for new stores.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, David. As we have said for many quarters, driving unit sales growth is key to our long-term strategy, and I'm pleased to report that we continue to make progress in this area. Once again, in Nielsen syndicated data, we have grown both unit and dollar share in the mid- to high single digits in the most recent 4-week and 12-week periods on top of our long track record of share growth. I believe this is attributable to our commitment to affordability. With our focus on affordability, we are offering customers to trade down on purchase price. For instance, in key categories such as food, paper, home cleaning and pet, unit growth is significantly ahead of sales growth in the most recent 12-week period. There is no doubt we may have sacrificed some sales as we look to drive units. Given the importance of unit growth and transaction growth as leading indicators of relevancy with our customers and of our future success, we believe this is the right trade-off for us. Another factor impacting our comp sales growth worth mentioning is that we have had essentially no inflation. The foundation of everything we do at Dollar General is grounded in serving our customers. We remain committed as ever to providing our customers with everyday low prices they can count on. We want to make sure that our customers know that they can find nearly all of their everyday items in our small box convenience stores. Our customers are the first place we start as we build our merchandising plans for the coming year. While on paper, it appears that the economy is improving, the low to middle income consumer, who is our core customer, continues to look ways -- looks for ways to manage her budget as she works to prioritize her spending, and she trusts that we are on her side to help her stretch her budget. Keep in mind she had a tough fourth quarter last year with a number of headwinds that are starting to moderate year-over-year, including SNAP benefit reduction, challenging weather, higher energy costs, reduction in unemployment benefits and the lingering effects on consumer spending from the 2% payroll tax increase in 2013.  As I reflect on our trends for the year, I believe that we underestimated the impact of these cumulative headwinds on our customer. As a result, there's no doubt that affordability is and will continue to be a focus of our core customer. Our renewed focus on $1 to $5 items continues to gain traction. We had more than 75% of our SKUs or 78% of our sales for the third quarter that were items priced at $5 or less. This is important as we know we trade more customers with the $1 fixed price retail concept than any other small box retailer.  Beyond that, we are continuing to add items with approximately 80 SKUs under our Smart & Simple brand at entry-level price points across 26 merchandise categories. In addition to the Smart & Simple brand, we continue to strategically introduce new $1 price point items on the shelf in key consumable categories, such as food, home cleaning and paper products, that are focused on affordability. All in, SKU counts in our $1 section in the store have increased more than 50% as compared to the end of 2013. New items include a combination of national brands and our private brands. In addition, we have expanded our $1 section offering to an additional 845 stores, with 96% of our stores having anywhere from 12 to 40 feet of $1 products across multiple categories, with an emphasis on health, beauty, paper, home cleaning and food. These $1 category expansions are a great way for customers to have increased purchasing power in our stores. Given that our average basket is around $11, our expanded offerings can have a positive halo effect on our customers' satisfaction as they leave our store with an additional item or 2.  We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our $5 or less price point assortment on our non-consumable categories, which represent about 60% of our merchandise offering. This clear focus on expandable consumption items at affordable price points has contributed to solid growth in our home and apparel sales this year.  As a result of these merchandise changes, we are seeing improvements in category sell-through rates. Non-consumables are important to our sales mix as we strive to enhance our gross profit rate. In the coming year, our plans have been developed to advance expandable consumption items in multiple categories, including storage, candles and domestics. In addition, we are in the midst of repackaging our private brands across both select consumable and non-consumable categories. The goal of the repackaging is to enhance our customers' perception of our private brand quality and value for the price. We had a test launch of the new packaging in select products with very encouraging results, and the majority of new repackaged items will be on the shelf in 2015. We continue to grow our private brands, with SKU count of 6% and penetration of over 24%.  We continue to look ways to leverage technology and engage consumers. We completed the initial rollout of our digital coupon capabilities in August and began to aggressively launch that program at the end of September and throughout October with our Fast Way to Save promotion. To date, sign-ups have significantly exceeded our expectations, and we have already hit our target for the year-end. With nearly 18 million digital coupons downloaded already, activations and redemptions are having a strong impact on sales of coupon-specific items. In 2015, we will be able to use the data captured from this program like a loyalty card but without the incremental cost. For instance, insights from a customer's shopping trip can be used to customize individual promotions to drive trips and baskets. This is an exciting opportunity that we should be able to capitalize on in 2015. I am pleased to report that we had favorable results and improving our inventory shrink performance in the third quarter. Over time, shrink improvement continues to be an opportunity as we remain steadfastly committed to reducing our shrink levels on a store-by-store basis. The store format and layout, SKU rationalization of high shrink items, defensive merchandising and exception-based reporting all play a role as we look for shrink improvement going forward.  Driving productivity at the store level is important as ever as our overarching goal is to create time savings that we can reinvest to better manage our stores and service our customers. In order to enable productivity gains, we are elevating our category management processes to optimize all areas of the store beyond the planograms to include all shelf and end cap displays. Over the last several years, we have made significant strides in the productivity of our planograms through SKU selection and ongoing refinement. We feel we've established a strong foundation in our planograms that we can refine periodically. We are concentrating on simplifying work at the store level by reducing the complexity of planogram resets.  At Dollar General, real estate is a core strength. Our real estate model is disciplined and focused on financial returns. Year-to-date, we have opened up 617 new stores and relocated or remodeled 874 stores, including approximately 380 life-cycle remodels. The life-cycle remodels are focused on our legacy smaller footprint stores and allow us to improve adjacencies and planogram layout. These stores are getting closer to the same sales lift as we get in our full remodel with a much lower investment, resulting in returns on the life-cycle remodel that are over 200 basis points higher than our full remodels. Given these strong returns, we plan to significantly expand our life-cycle remodel program in 2015. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, we will be utilizing our merchandising predictive technology capabilities in over 250 of our life-cycle remodels to optimize our space and SKU productivity. So we expect these remodels to drive even higher sales.  In 2015, we plan to open approximately 730 new stores and to relocate or remodel 875 stores with a priority on life-cycle remodels. In total, square footage growth is expected to be about 6%. We will expand our footprint into 3 new states in 2015, Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon, as we use our real estate model to identify winning sites for our traditional Dollar General format. We are right where we want to be as we enter the new year. Our real estate pipeline is 100% committed, and we're already working on 2016. Our new store productivity continues to be about 85% of our comp base, and we're looking forward to successful store openings in 2015. Also, in 2015, we will open our 13th distribution center as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growth. Site work has started on the new distribution center in San Antonio, Texas, and we plan to begin shipping from that distribution center in late 2015. We have exciting plans for 2015 and have lots of opportunities ahead of us. Now turning briefly to our proposal to acquire Family Dollar. We are as committed as ever to this acquisition and believe that the synergies we expect to achieve through the combination of these 2 companies would benefit Dollar General shareholders and, importantly, the consumer for many years to come. We're working hard to be in a position to complete this transaction and begin the process of combining our 2 companies. To that end, as we've stated, we are actively engaging with the FTC and believe that we are making good progress on that front. We filed our HSR notification with the FTC in mid-September. Since the filing, we have provided the FTC with tens of thousands of documents and have had a number of very valuable and productive discussions. Family Dollar shareholders are currently scheduled to vote on the Dollar Tree transaction at a special meeting on December 23. We are very aware of the calendar, and we look forward to sharing more information, with sufficient time, for Family Dollar shareholders to make an informed voting decision at the December 23 shareholder meeting.  Our 75th anniversary has been a time to reflect on our company's rich heritage and our mission of serving others. It's also an exciting time to look to the future and envision what the next 75 years will bring for Dollar General. My sincere thanks and appreciation go out to the 106,400 Dollar General employees as we are in the midst of the busiest season of retail. Over the years, Dollar General employees have built this business through hard work and dedication to our mission, and we owe them a great deal of gratitude. Thank you for an amazing 75 years.  Mary Winn, I'll now open the call up for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Yes. And as previously mentioned, we will not discuss our proposed acquisition of Family Dollar or related matters. [Operator Instructions] We'll now open up the call for questions. Dorothy? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Taylor LaBarr with Stifel. Taylor LaBarr : Just wondering if you can comment a little bit on the seasonal category trends throughout the quarter, how they perform relative to expectations, whether it was the same top cadence of improvement. And then also, expectations going into the fourth quarter, it looks, over the past few years, seasonal has been relatively weaker in the fourth quarter relative to other categories. So should we -- as you look at your plans and trends to date, is that a structural trend we should expect to continue? Or is that more of a multiyear easy comparison that we should think about? Richard Dreiling : Yes, great questions. We had a very good Halloween and a good back-to-school, really pleased with that. I will tell you the bigger seasons have slowed down a bit, summer and spring, and of course, we experienced a little bit of slow traffic last year on Christmas. I will tell you we have an offering this year on the Christmas side that is much different than last year, and it's focused on affordability, many, many items below $5. And again, this idea that the $1 price point is incredibly important to our customer, a lot of items focused on $1, and we -- I don't see a structural change yet. We're looking for good things with seasonal in the fourth quarter, so we'll see how it plays out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Obviously, a lot of focus on gas prices, but also, on the competitive environment. In the third quarter, we saw some improvement from some other discounters, at least a sequential improvement from the second to the third quarter. So my question is, what do you think the possibility is that as gas prices decline that you'll start to see some customers shift out of the discount convenience channel into other areas, especially after you've seen some massive customer migration into your channel over the last several years? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think that the way I look at gas prices, number one, you're not going to see -- it takes a while for the consumer to really believe they've got extra change in their pocket. It's going to take a series of trips to the gas station to realize there's a little more money there. I think the other thing to take into account would be that it makes the customer more moldable. They obviously have the wherewithal to search for more deals across more channels, but at the end of the day, we're on our 27th year of same-store sales growth. We've had good times, we've had bad times, good economies, high gas prices, low gas prices. And our customer always seems to search us out. So I think the work we've done on affordability, I think we have hit that one out of the park. The unit growth that we are seeing is great, and again, I think as long as we stay focused on affordability, the customers can always be searching for us. Michael Lasser : That's helpful. My follow question is, now that you have focused on affordability and building units, how do you build the basket or get them to trade back up after you've introduced the customer to all of these new products? Or is that not the focus? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I'd tell you the focus is on transactions and it's focused on units. I -- my personal feeling on this, Michael, is I never want to be in a position where I tell you my traffic is down and my basket is up, and I think that's when you start to get yourself into a bind. Our basket has been around $11 every year I've been here, and what we're seeing is that our customer's coming back more often to us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Obviously, you've had the lower gas prices. You've also seen a little bit of recovery in some of the labor metrics for, let's call it, non-college-educated consumers. Let's call it blue-collar kind of people. Rick, when you think about kind of all the gives and takes on the consumer side, I mean, how are you guys kind of thinking about it? And how do you think it rolls through 2015? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think the middle-income, the low-income customer, I do think there's still -- I still think they've got some issues. I don't believe they have them to the magnitude they had them last year. I do feel better about the consumer, but I'm still a little more cautious. I'm cautiously optimistic, and I think it's interesting, when we -- you can almost go back last year and look at when the staff cuts hit and watch what happened. This year, you can see when we've lapped those staff cuts, you can see the change in consumer behavior. So again, I'm cautiously optimistic, and I think it will flow through to the retail sales line as we move through '15. Scot Ciccarelli : And when you consider kind of incremental changes for '15, I know it's becoming a bigger topic for a bunch of other retailers just in terms of some of the changes being implemented with health care, affordable care, et cetera. Have you guys thought about the potential impact that could potentially have on some of your consumer buying patterns? Richard Dreiling : Yes, and again, that's why we're so committed to the affordability piece. That's why we're working so hard getting items into the store that price $5 or less or even centered around the $1 price point. The whole idea here is, I believe, affordability is going to be with us for a period of time yet, and our customer -- yes, and our customer is just always looking for a bargain. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer from Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : Your focus on growing transactions, and market share makes a tremendous amount of sense. But the one problem is that Dollar General's GMROI has now dropped for 4 consecutive years and inventory is about 50% of your tangible assets. So the focus on growing share is coming at the expense of lower returns. Looking, let's say, to 2015 or 2016, are there any initiatives that could enable you to achieve both a better market share as well as a higher inventory productivity? David Tehle : Yes, a couple of comments on that. First of all, you have taken about -- take into account tobacco, when you look at the margin and we made a strategic decision to add tobacco, knowing what that would do overall. I think as we look forward, there are initiatives going on in foreign sourcing, in our private label as well as shrink. And as Rick mentioned in his comments, we saw some positives in shrink this quarter. So we still have the capability to add to that gross margin and that gross margin percent. Now having said that, again, I go back to what Rick said as he kicked this off, driving unit sales growth and then transaction growth will continue to be high priorities for us and what we're going to be focused on because we think ultimately, that's what our long-term shareholders want to see. But yes, there is room in margin and there are things where we continue to work on, but again, the unit growth and the transaction growth will always be at the top of the list. Daniel Wewer : And David, just a follow-up. You had -- in your prepared comments, you noted that in the fourth quarter, you'll get a $0.04 contribution from tax credits. So I guess, tax rate is going to be, what, 35.5%, 36%. Did you have a similar tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year? David Tehle : So what this is, is the WOTC, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, and the way this works is these benefits expired December of last year, and we've been waiting all year for the federal government to take action on this. Last night, the House passed a bill of tax extenders by a vote of 378 to 46. That bill was now sent to the Senate, and the Senate is waiting for -- we're waiting for the Senate to take action on it. We, obviously, can't predict what the Senate will do, but if past history is any indication, more than likely, a 1-year extension will be provided. This is what we saw back in 2012 when this happened also, and then it'll be retroactively applied back. So we'll get the full year credit in the fourth quarter. As we've done our guidance for the full year, we always had this in our guidance. This isn't anything new. We felt like WOTC would come back, and we felt like it would probably be the fourth quarter simply because that's how it happened in the past. So again, it's been in there, and that's our thought process in terms of what hopefully will take place, but of course, we can't predict what the federal government will do. Daniel Wewer : Exactly. And you are saying, it was included in last year's fourth quarter earnings. David Tehle : It was included all year, last year, yes. If you go back to 2012 -- the fourth quarter in 2012 because we had the situation where it got reinstated. Daniel Wewer : Okay. I'll just switch -- just trying to get to an apples-to-apples number for the fourth quarter. So -- and so you are saying that it was worth $0.04 a year ago in the fourth quarter? Mary Winn Pilkington : No, no, Dan. It's Mary Winn. It was even. Because that had been adopted at the end of 2012, it was retroactive for 2012, and we took that all in the fourth quarter in 2012. And at that point in time, we provided the breakout of what that was on each quarter. And as it -- and then in 2013, it was effective all year in all 4 quarters. Daniel Wewer : Okay. I think I understand, okay. Mary Winn Pilkington : It lasted beginning of 2014. Daniel Wewer : There you go. Got you. David Tehle : Yes, it expired in December of 2013. Mary Winn Pilkington : That's right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler : I was wondering if you could just go into a little bit more detail about how you use the data from your coupon program. I understand you see it as being similar to loyalty program but less expensive, but could you just walk us through kind of how it works, what you get and then what you do with the information? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I mean, it's very similar to a loyalty card. The advantage is we don't have to massage the data, the company that we're working with does. And what you do is you offer them a coupon to see if you can change their behavior. And the example would be, Meredith, if I offer you $1 off Charmin toilet tissue and you don't respond to that coupon, right, and so then what would happen is that would mean you're buying your tissue somewhere else, and I can turn around and make the offer more rich. And it allows me -- and what happens is, I have a slate of coupons and you walk into them. And again, the coupons you choose not to opt into would indicate you're probably buying your product somewhere else, and I can enrich those offers to drive your behavior. Meredith Adler : And do you get to, in some way, keep track of each individual's purchases over time? Richard Dreiling : Absolutely. Remember, everybody enters their phone number, and it's how they register. Meredith Adler : Right, got it. And then I just wanted to talk -- you were talking about your, I want to call them lifestyle remodels, but you know that's not what I mean -- life-cycle remodels and... Richard Dreiling : Yes, sure. Meredith Adler : And you talked about, I think, 250 stores where you're actually going to be changing the offering and I think probably matching it to the local community better. Could you just talk about that initiative? Richard Dreiling : Yes, absolutely. So what we're going to do is we're going to take a store that's historically smaller that would go into a relocation bin, Meredith, and we're going to freshen these stores up and remodel them. And the idea here is they're going to have -- we will go into the store and analyze it and do category management. I'll use an example. This particular store in this particular market might sell more powdered detergent than liquid detergent, and what we will do is adjust the set to reflect more powder detergent, right. And there are markets, believe it or not, where powdered is still the biggest item. We have some markets where -- and I'll use the example of diapers. We have a diaper set that's exactly the same in every store across the chain, and now we'll be able to contract diapers and maybe expand on incontinence items in areas where we're closer to -- where the clientele's older. So we're really excited about this, and it's the heat-mapping concept that the guys have taken and spread out, where we can really understand what's selling and what's not on an individual store basis now. Meredith Adler : And do you believe that, that drives sales or margin or both? Richard Dreiling : Actually, I'd say both because what we end up doing is having the items the customer wants, and hopefully, they'll buy more of them. And then consequently, it drives more transactions. And again, I equate that, Meredith, down to more units and more transactions. We're focused on units and transactions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Nemer : So I wanted to talk about promotional activity. It was very heavy early in Q2 and then it had moderated, but it sounds from your comments like it may have picked back up again in Q3 given the higher consumables markdowns and the end-of-season inventory clearance. If you could just give some color around the cadence of the promotional activity. Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think it is -- I would say it's certainly a little higher than quarter 2, but I would not call it irrational or nearly as competitive as last year. Again, our goal has always been to come to the market with the right items, and I would look at you and say it's primarily the promotional activity right now, Matt, around CSD. And again, I think I brought up in the second or first quarter that we were going to be in line on CSD pricing, and that's where you'll find the bulk of the incremental markdown for us. Matt Nemer : Okay, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Could you just talk to the interplay between the port issues and the driver shortages versus potential relief on freight from lower diesel prices? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I will tell you that we do have some merchandise that's hung up on the West Coast. We have worked very hard and absorbed incremental transportation cost to try and get in, move that product around. I also know that we found out yesterday, some of the shippers are refusing now to go into the West Coast docks and -- which is going to create more pressure. We estimate that between the dock shortage, the higher cost to get merchandise moved, that it's about 6 to 9 basis points, but we offset that, by the way, with vessel where we were able to get our stem miles down. I do think that it's going to be a problem as we move through the fourth quarter, and it'll be a problem for everybody. We are working hard on trying to divert product to the East Coast. There's been no indication that they're going to support their brothers on the West Coast. So we're going to have to stay tuned on that one. Matt Nemer : But is there anything -- as you see kind of gas prices down and diesel prices down, is that big enough to potentially offset some of that? How quickly does that reset in your negotiations with the truckers? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think the down diesel prices will help, but I don't know that it's going to help depending on the magnitude of what we encounter. I think you guys all know the West Coast -- the President had said he's not going to interfere with that. He's going to let it take its own course. So I think the gas price -- the lower diesel cost will help, but it's not going to cover it all. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : So let me ask you, $5 items and under, where do you think that ultimately goes as a percent of sales, right? So how high do you think that goes in a reasonable period of time here? And then secondly, as part of that, if the number of items per basket are going up, ASP is going down, does that create some pressure, managing retail labor, right? Because you're trying to get throughput on more items with the same -- kind of the same basket size. Richard Dreiling : Yes, the first part of your question, we'll let the customer decide, right. When -- why we're adding more $1 and more items under $5? We are -- we still have a broad selection of product, right. So we're still very much in the game of letting the customer make the decision of what they want. And part of the way we have -- part of the way -- part of our success over the last year has been our ability to broaden our appeal, and some of that is not only the affordability angle but also having some more stuff in there. The second part of your question, we're working on getting case packs down, which will make it easier for the retail team to absorb the incremental items. I also think that having been on retail or having been on that side of the ledger, when sales are moving in the right direction, we've always somehow managed to conquer anything that's associated with it. And Greg and his team have done a marvelous job this year, so far, of working their way through that. We also, John, have, which we rolled out this year, a very serious stocking initiative, and we're doing a much better job not only in how we ship the product to the stores, but we're doing a much better job of measuring stocking productivity. John Heinbockel : All right. And then just secondly, I know you don't -- you never quantify where you sit with shrink, but where do you think that opportunity sits relative to where it might have been when you first came in or relative to -- however you want to measure it? Is there still a fairly large opportunity there? Richard Dreiling : Yes. It is certainly not at the level it was when I came in. It's better than that, but I see it as a significant improvement to come yet. In fact, even, John, where we were, we need to be better than where we were, if that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Edward Kelly : I'd like to just ask you a question about the gross margin here. On a FIFO basis, you were actually almost flat, which is the first time and probably a couple years that we've seen that. And what I was looking to do is maybe get some additional color on the puts and takes here because the question is around affordability, for instance, and the work you're doing there. What impact on the gross margin does that have? You've mentioned no inflation in the business, but I think we have seen inflation, for instance, in consumables. So are you holding the line there? Is that having a negative impact? Right, and then how are you offsetting all of that? David Tehle : Yes, so let me take a shot at some of these, and then certainly, Rick will comment, too. You have to remember, in our business, we're not as based on meat and produce and things of that nature where there has been a lot more impact of inflation. Now we have had a little bit of inflation in our candy and some of our other perishables, a little bit in tobacco. And particularly, as compared to last year, where it was actually going the other way, and that's why we have this LIFO negative that I spelled out earlier on the call. But I think, as you look at it, again, I go back to the 3 basic items that help us on gross margin in terms of offsetting negatives, and that is the foreign sourcing, the private label and the shrink. And we continue to push all 3 of those in terms of trying to drive a little bit more on the gross margin and the gross margin percentage. Edward Kelly : The work around affordability and particularly, you think about like the $1 price point, for instance, what impact does that have on margin? And then what impact does that have on gross profit dollars? Richard Dreiling : Yes. The margin on the affordability item is actually accretive. They tend to -- the $1 items tend to carry a little bit higher margin rate as do -- and the kind -- that margin rate will -- Ed, not as great when you get to the $5 items, but the lower-priced items, believe it or not, carry more. And it should help our rate. Edward Kelly : Okay. So do you think you're at the point where we should begin to see stability in the gross margin going forward or maybe even opportunity now? Richard Dreiling : I -- that is kind of where I'm at right now, to be honest with you. The work we've done on the margin -- we all have to remember we've got cigarettes in there, which is a 17 basis points drag albeit we've cycled that, but we anticipate we have margin expansion opportunities going forward now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Just to continue the conversation there on margins, just if you could hold our hand a little bit more on how you're thinking then about the fourth quarter, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you were a little bit disappointed in gross margins -- or it's a little bit below, I should say, your initial expectations. Do you see sequential improvement ahead given some of the comments you just made around some of these initiatives on private label? And also, if you can just remind us, David, on how we should be thinking about the impact of the incentive comp swing within SG&A. David Tehle : Yes. So I think as we look at the fourth quarter, right now, we're calling margins to be relatively flat, overall, in terms of basis points, and then we do have a significant delevering of SG&A. And you hit it right on. The biggest piece of that has to do with the incentive comp. If you go back to our script from fourth quarter last year, you'll see that we spelled out that incentive comp was a 45 basis point negative -- or excuse me, a 45 basis point positive last year to us because in essence, we had a fairly sizable reserve reversal in the fourth quarter since we did not pay any incentive comp. So that's the magnitude of what we're up against this fourth quarter. Paul Trussell : Got it. That's very helpful. And then just to go back and kind of clarify the fourth quarter comp outlook. It's certainly encouraging to hear that there has been an improvement in trends recently and that -- and we certainly acknowledge that you have an easier compare as we move through the quarter, but still, a 5% comp would be a pretty meaningful lift in acceleration on a 1-year basis. Maybe give us a little bit more color on what provides that level of confidence. How you think the discretionary categories will perform? And to what extent, if at all, are you -- do you believe that there will be incremental buying activity due to lower gas prices? Richard Dreiling : Yes. A really good question, and I'll break it into a couple different buckets here. This week, last year, was the first major snow event of the year in which we took a pretty sizable -- we had sizable difficulty managing the weather. This Saturday -- this coming Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday of next week. If you look at January, Paul, of last year -- and I think we called it out on the conference call for the fourth quarter, we came to work and had 1,000 stores shut down on several locations, right. And we dealt with a very, very, very weak January last year. January, historically, is one of our better months, better periods of the year. So I feel very comfortable in that there was -- and remember -- I'm getting a little ahead of myself here. I think, as I recall, there was a major snow event the week before Christmas last year, and unless you read the Farmers' Almanac, I'm very positive on the weather for the quarter. But I think that we've got that in our favor, and then I think the quality of our merchandise offering for Christmas is much better than it was last year, much better focused on affordability. This is, obviously, the big trimmer tree weekend. This is the first weekend where we see a lot of the Christmas trees being bought and all the decorations, and I'm still a little bit of a merchant. And we have reviewed all of our merchandising plans for December and January with the team, and we look pretty good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : I wanted to kind of step back and maybe just review -- I know we suspended the share repurchase. But maybe we can just remind everybody kind of how you look at your balance sheet, just generally, and share repurchase, notwithstanding, obviously, the activity but just kind of a review of how you guys think about things. David Tehle : Sure. Obviously, our #1 priority is investing in the business. We're a growth company. It's important to us to be opening up stores, so making sure that we have the capital to open new stores, to do remodels, to do relocations, and that we have the infrastructure in the back end of the business to support those stores, whether that be in the transportation and distribution area, in IT that we have system that will help make sure that we're supporting the stores. It's all about the stores, obviously. And then with the cash we have left over, our priority is share buyback and again, buying back as much stock as we can with what we have left after we've invested in the business. And because of the pending efforts on Family Dollar, we've suspended that share buyback on a temporary basis. Scott Mushkin : And a follow-up, as far as like your -- the levels of leverage you're comfortable with on the balance sheet, can you refresh us on that one as well, outside the M&A activity? David Tehle : Right, yes, yes, exactly, and that's very, very important. We became investment grade a while back, and our thought process is that we want to stay investment grade. In order to do that, that debt-to-EBITDA needs to be somewhere in that 3.0, maybe a little bit higher than that, 3.1, somewhere in that range, overall, is where our targets are. Right now, we're at 3.1. We had a fairly sizable share buyback earlier in the year, $800 million, that's still with us, that's impacted that indice. That's why it's 3.1. We had been at 3.0 pretty solidly for many quarters on that. Scott Mushkin : All right. That's perfect. And then I had another longer-term strategic question really revolving around the merchandising. I know you guys have got the DG market out there and still, I think, in test mode, but I wanted to, kind of longer term, think about how you're thinking about perishables in your business. A lot of our research shows that the lower end is starting to embrace a higher degree of wanting more fresh items and wanted to think -- is that something you think you can do by yourself? Will you need a partner? I mean, how are you thinking about fresh going forward? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think as I think about this, one of the areas that we've struggled with the most on the DG market side is the produce and the meat side, the fresh side. And when you grow up like I did, managing in a grocery store, managing in produce and meat, you realize that it's -- basically, you treat it like a living thing. And when you don't grow up with that, it's very hard to get people to understand the importance of rotation and the importance of display techniques. So it sounds easy to do, but it's much more difficult than that. I think long term, it's possible that a Dollar General might have some subset of fresh merchandise, right, maybe some oranges and some apples and bananas and potatoes, but long term, right now at least -- and by the way, you never say never. But right now, I would say us getting into any kind of significant position in that kind of perishable merchandise is probably not on our radar screen right now. Now frozen food, we love, and we've done a lot of great work on that. And by the way, we've done some good on easier to manage perishable items, like cheese and butter and orange juice and some items like that, lunch meat. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Daniel Binder : My question was around gross margin. You cited some promotional activity. I'm just curious how much of the promotional activity is reactive versus more predatory from your perspective. And if gross margin opportunities exist, do you think you can get more predatory in particular areas? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I mean, I'll answer that one. I would characterize it probably more reactionary than predatory. We are intently focused on everyday low price and -- but part of that is you have to be careful that there are some items out there where the consumer might judge your everyday low price based on what they see in the ad. So and again, I'll reiterate, the -- primarily, the promotional activity that we had in the quarter was all on CSD. So yes, and I would also say the more and more stable the promotional environment gets, it allows you to make investments in other areas of the business that you might want to, like the non-consumables side. Daniel Binder : And my follow-up question was on home and apparel. It's -- I realize there's been a lot of mix change here and the price points you've talked about quite a bit. How much of the improvement in those businesses do you think is a function of the price points changing versus the quality of the product or the particular products that you're putting on the shelves? Richard Dreiling : Yes, it's actually a combination of both. We're doing a much better job of color, a much better job of getting the product into the stores at the right time, a much better job of clearing out the old product prior to the new product getting in, and then I have to tell you we're promoting the product very similar to how a department store would. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners. Mark Montagna : A question about IMU. I'm wondering how many quarters in a row has it been -- the IMU, has been noticeably higher. And then does that coincide with the rise of the $1 items? Or is there something else that's helping drive that? Richard Dreiling : Offhand, I don't know how many quarters in a row it has been up, but I can tell you it's a combination of the $1 items and doing a better job of buying. Mark Montagna : Okay. And then as a follow-up, David, on the guidance for the fiscal year, I think you said that it does not -- it's not impacted by the cost of the potential that you're spending on the FDO pursuit, but in the third quarter, you included $8 million into SG&A. I just want to make sure I heard that right in understanding what you're saying on that. David Tehle : The -- so in the third quarter, we excluded the $8 million. We spelled it out, and we excluded it. As a matter of fact, if you go to the press release, there's a chart at the back that'll show you what's excluded from earnings per share, and that is excluded. And again, any cost that we'll have in the fourth quarter will be excluded also. Mary Winn Pilkington : All right. So that -- operator, that concludes our call today. Emma Jo and I will be around if anybody has any questions. I know we left a few people in the queue, but thank you very much for your time and attention, and we look forward to speaking to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Labrielle, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, March 12, 2015. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Labrielle, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Vasos, our Chief Operating Officer; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.  Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2015 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures, our planned fiscal 2015 operating and merchandising initiatives, and our 2015 and 2016 store growth initiatives and our beliefs regarding future consumer economic trends. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2013 Form 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2014, any subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call.  We will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Where available, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which I mentioned is posted on dollargeneral.com.  The purpose of our call today is to discuss our performance for the fiscal Q4 2014 quarter and fiscal year and our outlook for the 2015 fiscal year. At the end of our prepared remarks, we'll open the call up to your questions on those subjects. [Operator Instructions] Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Today, we reported results for the fourth quarter 2014 and the full year.  2014 was a unique year for Dollar General as we generated record operating results, but our strategic actions to acquire Family Dollar were unsuccessful. However, as our results and outlook indicate, Dollar General has a very promising future. Today's accelerated store growth plans for 2016 and expanded capital return plan for shareholders reaffirm our continued confidence in our long-term growth prospects. Returning cash to shareholders remains a top priority, and we plan to return approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders during 2015 through both share repurchases and the initiation of a regular cash quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share. I'm excited about another great year in 2015 as we look to capitalize on the numerous opportunities ahead of us. We have been and remain focused on Dollar General's core business, and we are confident that Dollar General is well positioned for sustainable growth, creating shareholder value going forward.  Let's recap some of the highlights for 2014. Full year sales increased 8% to a record $18.9 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $2 -- $223. 2014 marked our 25th consecutive year of same-store sales growth as we delivered same-store sales growth of 2.8% for the year. Importantly, our trends improved as we moved through the year. Our same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 4.9%, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of acceleration. In the quarter, same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and non-consumables. The non-consumables categories have had -- now had 4 consecutive quarters of improvement with notable strength in apparel and home.  For the year, GAAP earnings per share increased 10% and adjusted earnings per share increased 9%. Net income in the fourth quarter increased 10%. Earnings per share improved 16% to $1.17 per share.  For the quarter, the recent West Coast port slowdown negatively impacted our earnings per share by approximately $0.02 as higher margin merchandise coming through the West Coast port was delayed. This estimate includes incremental costs for shipments that had to be diverted to alternative facilities on the East Coast.  For the 28th consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket. We generated significant cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion, an increase of more than 8%. During the year, we returned $800 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 14.1 million shares of common stock.  As our results indicate, we continued to make great progress in 2014. We opened 700 new stores and exceeded our combined remodels and relocation targets with 915 stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6.3%. We broke ground on our 13th distribution center in San Antonio, Texas to help us serve our growing store base in the southwest and generate efficiencies. On the merchandising front, we continued to innovate and improve the sales productivity of our stores. We successfully completed our first full year of tobacco sales and saw positive year-over-year performance after the anniversary. Our renewed focus on $1- to $5-items continued to gain traction with our customers. Now more than 75% of our SKUs or 76% of our sales in the fourth quarter were items priced at $5 or less. I'm pleased to say that we continued to increase our overall market share in consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week periods ending January 31, 2015. As we experienced last quarter, our emphasis on affordability continues to pay off as our unit share growth continues to outpace our dollar share growth over any period measured in the last 52 weeks.  In 2014, we successfully stabilized our shrink performance in the second quarter. Shrink had a modest positive contribution year-over-year to our gross margin performance in the second half of the year. This should bode well for 2015. We relaunched our customer satisfaction survey at the beginning of 2014 to reevaluate those aspects of the store experience that have the greatest impact on satisfaction and customer spending. We have seen the response from our customers improve consistently over the last 6 months as we measure what is important to them. We are constantly striving to fill the need to meet the changing demands of our customers. Looking ahead to 2015, we are cautiously optimistic for our core customer. For the first time in a number of years, there appears to be the potential for tailwinds to outweigh the headwinds for macro trends. And the consumer is more positive, as indicated by the recent consumer sentiment levels and consumer confidence having recently been at the highest level since August of 2007. It is my belief that these consumer confidence readings are impacted by a headlines job number that has improved and by lower energy prices. Offset to these positives are the elevated underemployment rate along with the continuing low labor participation rate, and we are watching these factors closely.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Todd to talk about our initiatives for 2015. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Rick. Moving on to 2015, our core operating priorities remain clear : driving productive sales growth, enhancing gross margins, leveraging process improvement in IT to reduce cost, and strengthening and expanding our culture of serving others. The team is focused, and we are excited about our initiatives for 2015. We continue to be committed as ever to providing our customers with everyday low prices they know and trust at Dollar General. Affordability will play a key role as we look to expand SKUs across the store at the sweet spot of $1 to $5. Growing transactions and item units will continue to be key to our market share performance as we build upon our track record of success. In anticipation of changes to the competitive landscape, we've been testing several different labor models to determine the potential impact on sales growth. The goal of the test was to strategically target labor investments to grow market share in a competitive environment while providing for positive financial returns. Our experience in this test and learn has been positive, and we are selectively investing in store labor this year. The store operations team has specific metrics and timetables for achieving results. The great part of this is that we can be nimble in making adjustments to the model as appropriate. While I won't go into more detail today, I look forward to sharing more specifics and results as we roll through the program in 2015. In addition, we have realigned our store operations management structure to optimize the scale of our divisions, regions and districts to improve accountability and maximize mentorship and teamwork, all while driving stronger, more sustainable results. We made the alignment changes based on feedback we received from our field teams and a strategic evaluation of our operational structure and store growth plans. The result is an operational structure that allows our field leaders to focus on store standards and ultimately create a better and more consistent shopping experience for our consumers. For 2015, on average, we have reduced the number of stores per district. By optimizing the scale of our districts, we will reduce the time our district managers spend driving so they can invest more time mentoring and coaching our store managers on developing and strengthening their teams. This should result in improved store standards and drive incremental sales.  On the merchandising front, we're in the midst of repackaging our private brands across both select consumable and non-consumable categories. The goal of the repackaging is to enhance our customers' perception of our private brand quality and value for the price. We had a test launch of the new packaging in select products with very encouraging results, and the majority of these repackaged items are expected to be on the shelf by midyear. We continue to grow our private brands with SKU count up 6% over 2013 and penetration of about 24%. We are continuously looking for ways to leverage technology and engage our customers. We completed the initial rollout of our digital coupon capabilities in August and began to aggressively launch the program at the end of September and throughout the fourth quarter with our Fast Way to Save promotion. To date, sign-ups have significantly exceeded our expectations with about 1 million customers having registered for the program. With more than 35 million digital coupons downloaded already, activations and redemptions are having a strong impact on sales of coupon-specific items.  In 2015, we'll be able to use the data captured from this program like a loyalty card but without the incremental cost. For instance, we plan to use these insights from a customer's shopping trip to customize individual promotions and ultimately drive incremental trips and larger baskets.  Shrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities as we remain committed to reducing our shrink levels on a store-by-store basis. At Dollar General, every function is involved in driving shrink improvement. The store format and layout, SKU rationalization of high-shrink items, defensive merchandising and exception-based reporting all play a role as we look for shrink improvement going forward.  Driving productivity at the store level is as important as ever. Our overarching goal is to create time savings that we can reinvest to better manage our stores and serve our customers. In order to enhance our productivity gains, we are elevating the category management process to optimize all areas of the store beyond the planograms to include off-shelf and end-cap displays. Over the last several years, we have made significant strides in the productivity of our planograms through SKU selection and ongoing refinement. We feel we have established a strong foundation in our planograms that we can refine periodically. We are concentrating on simplifying work at the store level by reducing the complexity of planogram resets. At Dollar General, real estate is a core strength. Our real estate model is disciplined and focused on financial returns. We're very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2015 as our pipeline is full and the real estate team is already working on the pipeline for accelerated growth in selling square feet of approximately 7% in 2016. This translates to approximately 900 new store openings for 2016. We have a strong track record of delivering exceptional returns in our new store program, and we are confident in our model going forward. In total, growth in selling square footage in 2015 is expected to be about 6%. Just to put this growth in perspective, this equates to about 7 projects a day for our real estate team across new stores, relocations and remodels. We plan to open approximately 730 new stores. We have already expanded our footprint into 3 new states in 2015 : Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon, as we use our real estate model to identify winning sites for our traditional Dollar General format. Our new stores, productivity continues to be 85% of our comp base, and we're looking forward to successful new store openings in 2015. In addition, about 875 stores will be relocated or remodeled in 2015. In 2014, we concentrated our remodel program on our legacy smaller-footprint stores. This approach allowed us to improve adjacencies and planogram layouts. These stores are getting close to the same sales lift as we get in our full remodels with a much lower investment, resulting in returns on life-cycle remodels that are over 200 basis points higher than our full remodels. As a result of the success of our life cycle remodels in 2014, we are applying these learnings to all remodels in 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, we are utilizing our merchandising predictive technology capabilities in select life cycle remodels to optimize our space and SKU productivity, so we can expect these remodels to drive even higher sales.  Also in 2015, we will open our 13th distribution center as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growth. We plan on shipping from this distribution center in late fiscal 2015. We are excited about our plans, and I'm confident that we'll meet our operating goals. We continue to be cautiously optimistic regarding the economic outlook for our customers. But we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. Now David will share a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our 2015 guidance. David Tehle : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Rick and Todd have taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter and year as well as our outlook for fiscal 2015. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 31.7% of sales, a decrease of 23 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. As compared to the prior year, the 2 most significant factors were the negative impact from the West Coast port slowdown and the LIFO provision that was made in the fourth quarter. Specifically, the West Coast port disruption led to an estimated $8.5 million or $0.02 per share negative impact due to the higher-margin inventory receipt not being received and incremental transportation costs. In addition, we recorded a LIFO provision of about $1.1 million in the 2014 fourth quarter compared to a LIFO benefit of $4.5 million in the 2013 fourth quarter.  Total SG&A increased by 27 basis points in the fourth quarter as we were lapping last year's significant leverage in SG&A due to the reversal of incentive compensation in the fourth quarter of 2013. This alone contributed 34 basis points to the SG&A increase. In addition, we incurred $6.1 million in expense during the fourth quarter of 2014, or 12 basis points, related to the attempted acquisition of Family Dollar. We had good underlying expense performance that was favorable for both retail and admin functions.  Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.8% compared to 37.5% in the 2013 quarter. This included a $9 million or $0.03-per-share benefit from the reenactment retroactive to January 1, 2014, of the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit. This was in line with the outlook we provided on our third quarter call. The fourth quarter of 2014 also benefited from the deductibility of expenses incurred in prior quarters associated with our attempted acquisition of Family Dollar.  Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled nearly $580 million as we did not buy back shares in the second half of the year because of the attempted acquisition. At year-end, merchandise inventories were $2.78 billion, up 9% in total or 2.9% on a per-store basis. Total capital expenditures were $374 million, including $127 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $102 million for new leased stores; $38 million for stores built by us; $64 million for distribution center and transportation-related items; and $35 million for information system upgrades and technology-related projects.  Now for an overview of our guidance for 2015. We expect top line sales for 2015 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall square -- selling square footage is expected to grow approximately 6%, and same-store sales are expected to increase by 3% to 3.5%. Operating profit is forecasted to be in the range of 7% to 9% over adjusted operating profits for 2014. We expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 37% to 38%. Similar to 2014, we expect the WOTC legislation to be reenacted by the end of 2015. This benefit is included in our tax rate. As a result, our effective tax rate will be higher early in the year and lower later in the year.  We expect diluted earnings per share of $3.85 to $3.95, representing growth of 10% to 13% over the 2014 adjusted EPS of $3.50. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating.  Demonstrating this commitment, we announced today we have initiated a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock. The board also approved an additional $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. We are assuming approximately 295 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year, which assumes the anticipated repurchase of approximately $1.3 billion of our common stock. All in, this repurchase activity represents approximately 6% of our current market capitalization. Also to put this in context, since December of 2011, we have repurchased $2.3 billion of our common stock. By the end of fiscal 2015, we are forecasting total share repurchases since inception to be about $3.6 billion, with 2015 repurchases representing about 36% of the total. In total, as Rick mentioned, we plan to return about $1.6 billion to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends in 2015.  2015 capital expenditures are forecasted to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Approximately 35% will be for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; 30% for new leased stores or stores built by us; 25% for distribution center and transportation-related items; and 10% for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. As we mentioned, we're closely monitoring the residual effects of the West Coast port slowdown and the impact on our seasonal merchandise receipts. The good news is that a tentative agreement has been reached, but it will take months to clear the backlog. Right now, based on the current status of shipments and the uncertainty surrounding the situation, we anticipate a possible drag to earnings of about $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter. And we'll continue to monitor the impact to the timing of receipt and any potential sales and markdown risks as we work through the backlog.  As our long-term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers regardless of how the economy plays out. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thanks, David. Before we wrap up, I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude to David upon his announced retirement. David has served for nearly 11 years as our CFO. He has been a trusted adviser, business partner and more importantly, a good friend to me. His financial acumen, partnership and steady hand at the helm of our financial strategy have been instrumental in transforming Dollar General and in fueling our impressive growth. While I will truly miss David's leadership and working with him on a daily basis, I'm incredibly happy for him. And I want to wish David, his wife, Mona, and his 2 sons, Nick and Tony, much happiness as they embark on this exciting new journey. Dollar General is a strong and growing business with tremendous high store-return growth opportunities that we intend to capture. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. Even as the competitive landscape continues to evolve, we have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our business generates significant cash flow and we're in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividends.  More importantly, I remain excited by the countless opportunities in front of Dollar General and convinced of its ability to capture them. My appreciation and thanks goes out to more than the 105,000 Dollar General employees that executed nearly 1.7 billion customer transactions in 2014 while fulfilling our mission of serving others. With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines up for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Operator, we'll go for questions. Would you mind, repeat the instructions, if you would, please, for getting in the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne Agee. Charles Grom : Congrats, David, on your retirement. Just the first question on the 4.9% comp, could you share with us how it trended during the quarter? And any thoughts on quarter-to-date trends? And also just curious given your roughly 11% exposure to Texas, how the Texas market's holding in for you. Richard Dreiling : Yes, the comps just accelerated through the quarter, every period, getting progressively better. The weather the last couple of weeks has been a little funky again, but I would say the first part of the current quarter is performing as expected. And Texas continues to be one of the strongest markets we have. Charles Grom : Okay, great. And then just bigger picture with the FDO deal now in the past, can you give us a sense for what you think the company's longer-term store potential could be? And then as -- and as a follow-up to that, where you think the DG Market concept fits into the equation? Richard Dreiling : Yes, as we -- every -- like we do every year, Chuck, in January, we evaluate a number of opportunities that are out there. We still see over 13,000 store opportunities for Dollar stores in continental United States. As we committed, we're going to accelerate our store growth in 2016. We still believe store growth is the best use of our funds right now based on the returns we generate and how they comp after that first year. Dollar General Market is very much still, I would say, in the testing stage for us. As I've said before, I have grown up selling produce and meat, but teaching somebody to sell produce and meat are 2 entirely different things and we continue to work on that concept. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Congrats, David, on the retirement. David Tehle : Thank you. Paul Trussell : Staying on that, Rick, David, you've been quite a duo here for some time. Can you just discuss the timing of your departures a bit more in detail? 2015 is becoming quite a big transitional year for Dollar General. Just why should we be extremely confident in DG's ability to continue to perform in what's an ever-changing competitive and consolidating marketplace? And also, why has the board not yet announced a successor for you, Rick? And what are the qualities that are being sought out? Richard Dreiling : Yes. I think, Paul, that's very fair, and I'll let David weigh in here. Quite honestly, one of the things that we worked incredibly hard on in this company over the last few years has been the depth of our bench. And I think what should give all of you -- make you feel all really good is while David and I might be departing, there's a tremendous amount of strength behind us that manages this company on a day-in and day-out basis and actually, has been advising David and I for a very long period of time. If you think about -- there has been change over the last few years, and the bulk of that change has been satisfied by the bench that we have developed that we've been able to promote from within. In regards to myself, I can tell you the board is actively engaged in the search and the board is making solid progress. And I would anticipate that my successor, over the course of the next short period of time, will probably be identified. David, did you... David Tehle : Yes, I just -- obviously, retirement is a personal decision. I'm at the age where most people start to think seriously about it. This gives me a rare opportunity to spend lots of valuable time with my 2 teenage sons as they finish their last years of high school. And now I'll be able to make it to all of their events, which is something most fathers don't get to do. Over the past 11 years, particularly over the past 8 years, I've lived every CFO's dream. I was part of the team that took this company private in 2007, took it public in 2009 and had been able to participate in one of the most spectacular retail growth stories in this decade and it's continuing, as we announced today with our square footage growth for 2016 in opening 900 new stores, again, that's nothing short of spectacular. I believe I'm leaving one of the finest finance and accounting teams in retail today. So the company is in good hands in that respect, and I wouldn't be leaving if I didn't feel that way. So the experience has been great for me. I believe it will continue to be great for our shareholders and our employees as the Dollar General story keeps moving on. Paul Trussell : I appreciate the color. Just to follow up on the remaining bigger picture, maybe just a bit more detail on how you came up with the capital return plan, some of the discussions you all had to decide to initiate the dividend and just how we should think about you guys managing the leverage ratio going forward? Is the plan to maintain this 3x kind of adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio on a go-forward basis? Are you willing to be more aggressive at times and go above that? Just how should we think about the balance of capital returns going forward? Richard Dreiling : David? David Tehle : Sure, I'll jump in here. And please, Rick or Todd, anything else you want to add here. I think probably the better question is why didn't do we a dividend earlier. 85% of companies in the S&P 500 pay a dividend, and until today, we were the largest retailer not paying one. So we clearly were an outlier on the dividend. As we looked at this decision, in this low interest rate environment, the dividend is highly valued by investors that are trying to find yield. And obviously, it's hard to find yield in the debt markets. I think this also sends a positive signal to the market of our confidence in future profitability and cash flow of the company. As we look at the share buyback, again -- and we went through some of these statistics. We've already returned $2.1 billion through the share repurchases since we went public in 2009, and we're guiding another $1.3 billion in 2015. That's 62% of what we bought back over the last 5 years, all being bought back in 1 year in 2015. So we are consistent in our share repurchases over time, and that investment-grade rating is important to us. We've talked about that in the prepared comments. We believe from our research is that's our optimal capital structure is to be at that lower rung of investment grade, and it provides us with flexibility for growth and ultimately, shareholder return. At the same time, and I've said this for many years, our #1 priority in terms of investing is investing in our stores, store growth, and then having the infrastructure in place to support that. And as I just mentioned, we're growing stores at a greater rate now than we have probably any time in the history of the company as we move forward into 2016, at least in the modern history of the company. So we'll continue to make that a priority. In terms of the leverage ratio, again, right now, because of our view that the optimal capital structure is going to be at that lowest rung of investment grade, our intent is to stay somewhere in that range. Clearly, the management team and the board will continually review this on an ongoing basis and so stay tuned on that. But right now, we're very happy with where we are and what we're doing. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So 2 things just on the long term. How many stores can the organization handle annually? Right, if you think about that 7% number, obviously, it gets bigger as the base gets bigger, when do you get to a point where you worry about execution? And then you're basically assuming for this year, if I look at your guidance, roughly flat EBIT margin. Is that the right long-term algorithm? Or do you think there's room for margin improvement, maybe as shrink goes down and you leverage G&A and things like that? Richard Dreiling : Tell you what, John, I'll let Todd handle the first part. And David, you can take the second part on that one. Todd Vasos : Thanks, Rick. John, and we've said it many times, we look at our store openings and the projects that we can do, we look at it from the respect of capacity and the capacity of our folks to be able to deliver the high-quality sites that we've been come to known to deliver over the many years. So we continue to reevaluate that. And as you've heard and you've seen, we've stepped it up to 730 this year and into 900 the following year. So we'll continue to look at ways to continue to do more projects as we move forward, but we're committed to square footage growth in that 6% to 7%. David Tehle : Yes, I think as we look at our operating margin, clearly, we do expect better performance than we saw in 2013 and 2014 given some of the product category headwinds we had from tobacco in those years. As we look forward, I think as we look at shrink and category management and foreign sourcing, again, we still think we have room to expand the operating margin. Now we've got to make a decision, and I've said this many times, in terms of how much of that to let fall to the bottom line and how much to invest back in our pricing because ultimately, our #1 goal remains selling units through the box and making sure that we continue to grow our transactions. So -- but again, there's still room there, particularly when you look at shrink, category management and foreign sourcing. John Heinbockel : And then, Rick, just as a follow-up on DG Market. When you look at what Aldi's doing, Lidl coming, does that format hold greater importance to you strategically than it might have a couple of years ago? Can you -- before you leave, can you kind of get it on the right track? And then is it -- do you see more -- the impact will be more in -- and if you do go forward with it, more in the format itself or learnings that you take back into the core dollar stores, be it produce, expanded food? Or we're not really going to see that? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think as I look at what we do best and probably, I would say, John, right now, the best format we have, when you mention competitors like Aldi, is our 7,500-square-foot box. Yes, there's some -- Aldi has some more consumables in it. But you have to remember, we're a convenience shop. We're not a destination shop. And I think that 7,500 box, when you look at that producing $223 a foot, you look at where it has come from, we believe that is the best piece we've got. When I think about Dollar General Market, I think you hit the nail on the head. I think that learnings are what we're extracting from that. And the fact that some of those learnings eventually are going to work their way into that 7,500 highly productive box. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Daniel Binder : David, we'll be sorry to see you go, but congratulations on your retirement. David Tehle : Thank you. Daniel Binder : My question was related to expansion this coming year. And then as you step it up to 7% square footage growth next year, is there a particular regional focus that you'll have? Richard Dreiling : Dan, that's a great question. The store base is going to expand pretty much uniformly all the way through United States. Obviously, we've just entered Oregon, Rhode Island and Maine. So there's probably a little bit more emphasis there, but the idea is to spread it out across the United States. Daniel Binder : And you cited this focus on price investment. Just curious if you could comment on what you're seeing in the competitive landscape this past quarter and early this quarter? Richard Dreiling : Good. Todd, you want to take that one? Todd Vasos : Yes. Sure, Dan. What we've seen is in our channel and really across retail, it's always competitive. But what we've seen is a pretty rational competitive set, if you will. When you look at it, definitely much more rational than it was in fourth quarter of 2013. But there's pockets here and there we see, depending on the format that we see out there, that there are some competitors that may get a little hotter than others. But I -- we are committed to ensuring that we drive units and that we look at our share very, very intently each and every week to ensure that we're staying very competitive. But I think the biggest thing to take away is we are squarely EDLP focused, so everyday low price focused in everything we do. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler : Lots of luck to you, David. David Tehle : Thanks, Meredith. Meredith Adler : I got a couple of questions. And when David was talking about the things that would drive the operating margin, he didn't specifically mention higher sales of discretionary items. Even though I know that your apparel and home business is doing well, but do you see, as the customer feels better, that there is a potential to drive more high-margin sales? Richard Dreiling : Again, I think the answer to that is yes. We've worked really, really hard on the non-consumables side, Meredith. And I have to be honest, it took us a little longer to get there than we wanted. But I'll tell you what, the team that Todd and David assembled down there are really clicking now. And that's really encouraging about the non-consumables side is the rate of sell-through. And we're seeing a much larger -- a much higher sell-through on those goods, which, to your point, brings out the incremental margin, helps us with the incremental margin. Meredith Adler : Great. And then, I guess, my other question is maybe just a little more technical for David. But you continued to invest capital in stores that you're building yourselves, and I'm sure the economics of that are attractive. But I'm wondering whether there is an opportunity to do sale leasebacks, rates are low. And then if you were to do that, first, I don't know, maybe you could tell us how much -- how many stores you own at this point and whether you could generate incremental capital that could be invested or given back to shareholders? David Tehle : Yes. And of course, last year we did do sale-leaseback and we used those proceeds to buy back stock. So I don't -- it's something we'll definitely take a look at. It's always on -- we don't have any plans right now to do it. It's always on the radar screen and certainly, it's something that we'll take a hard look at. And then the -- how many owned stores we have? Yes, we have between 500 and 600 owned stores right now. Mary Winn Pilkington : Yes, about 5%. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Can you help break down the components of your 3% to 3.5% same-store sales guide? Particularly, I know you guys benefit on the real estate side from the new store waterfall. It sounds like you have a lot of traffic-driving initiatives, and then maybe just touch on the expectation for nonfood, given the recent acceleration. Richard Dreiling : I think Todd wants to take that one. Todd Vasos : Yes, when you take a look at it, what we -- we definitely, from our new store maturation, we see 1.5 to 2 percentage points of comp. Of course, category management plays a big piece in our comp as well. So between category management and execution at the store level, we really make up the balance piece of that. But affordability continues to be a key focus of ours to continue to drive the sales, as well as our focus on private brands. And then, lastly, you heard, we are doing a lot of remodels. We did a lot last year and we're -- we continue to do those in 2015. And updating that base out there of existing stores really makes a difference as we start to look at these remodels and adding to the comp. So when you put it all together, we feel pretty good about that 3% to 3.5% comp range. Richard Dreiling : And I would piggyback on that, Matt, and Todd did a great job of talking about it, but his work on the affordability issue, the fact that over 75% of our SKUs in sales now are targeted between $1 and $5, that has a lot of broad appeal across a lot of income stratas. And we are continuing to work on that very hard and see upside on that initiative in '15 and beyond, to be honest about it. Matthew Boss : Great. And then on the stores front, Rick, can you just elaborate on the return profile and the payback period on new stores? And any changes you guys have seen in productivity levels at some of your more recent openings? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I will. Our stores still open up at about 85% of our average store volume. 99% of our stores continue to be four-wall EBITDA positive, and the payback is roughly 1 year, 1.5 years, in that window. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : Well, we hate to see you young guys retire from the company. Richard Dreiling : Actually, I was hoping for someone to say I'd been carrying David for 11 years. Daniel Wewer : I just wanted to ask on the stepped-up expansion rate in 2016, if you could talk about the type of real estate projects, particularly in terms of geography that you'll be pursuing that you would have perhaps passed on a year ago. And thinking specifically when you think about suburban, urban and rural markets, if we're going to see it change in the pace that you opened in those 3 type of geographies. Richard Dreiling : Yes, I think Todd has a thought on that, Dan. Todd Vasos : Yes, Dan. As Rick said earlier, it is going to be broad-based across everywhere we are actually already operating stores in. We continue to look at all areas that we operate in. California continues to be an opportunity for us. We know that someday there will be over 1,100, 1,200 stores in California. So that continues to be an opportunity. But when you look at it in 2016, our balance between metro and rural is going to be about where it's been over the course of the last few years. And then as we go into outer years, we'll continue to leverage our learnings that we've got moving through on our metro stores and build and open up more of those as we move into '17, '18 and '19. Richard Dreiling : If I could piggyback back then on, Dan, as we move further and further deeper into the 13,000, we're going to introduce more metro stores. And the team is looking at lots of different alternatives here in terms of the size of the box. We've actually been -- I think we've really done a great job on the mix that's in the stores. I do think that we have figured something out that we're going to test in '15 that could really guide us, really help generate incremental return in metro. Daniel Wewer : When you say metro stories, I'm assuming you're including suburban with urban. I was curious how would you just characterize Dollar General's success in suburban markets, which might have higher income levels than the company has targeted historically? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I -- go ahead, Todd. Todd Vasos : I'm sorry, did you... Richard Dreiling : No. You go ahead, Todd. Todd Vasos : Yes, so when you look at it, our suburban stores, we're happy with the performance of those stores as -- but as Rick indicated, we're testing some things, both in suburban and metro, that we really feel can benefit us as we move through '15 and beyond, both from a labor perspective and a merchandising perspective with our technology that we've got moving in merch, to ensure we have the right mix of products as well as the right gross margin that is generated from that. So we feel pretty good about where we are, but there's always more learnings yet. Richard Dreiling : I think it's fair to say that we're getting sophisticated enough now that we're able to alter the mix. Todd Vasos : That's right. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : And David, everyone's saying congratulations. I've got to say maybe I'm just a little envious. I have teenage kids at home. So congrats, I guess. It'll be nice to spend a lot more time with them. David Tehle : Well, thank you. Richard Dreiling : I don't know, Scott. I raised 2 kids. I don't know if being home when they're teenagers is a good thing or not. Scott Mushkin : So I guess, I want to get to labor cost, what you're thinking of as we look through the year. Obviously, a competitor raised their labor rates, but with labor markets getting pretty tight and how that affects your business, what you're seeing in store management turnover? Richard Dreiling : Yes, I'll take that one. And then, Todd, if you want to lay any color on it, that would be fine. I know we're talking a lot about the minimum wage thing and what has happened with one of the larger big-box operators out there. A couple of things I'd like to lay out, Scott. Number one is we don't have a single full-time employee that's making minimum wage, not one. About 12% of our employees, all part time, are at the minimum wage rate. But the fascinating thing is the way our structure is in the store, after about 5 months, they are in a position to be promoted to what we call is a key carrier. And our average key carrier makes $9 an hour, approximately $9 an hour. So it's pretty safe to say that we -- our whole workforce is not making minimum wage and there is some sort of grand or fearful expense that's going to be there. And when I'm talking about minimum wage, I'm obviously talking about the federal minimum wage. What we are going to do though, I think it's fair to say the labor market, conceivably, is tightening up. We're going to keep our eyes. We're going to continue to monitor the landscape and we'll assess or make any adjustments that we need to make. But right now, in terms of what we're paying our people, we feel pretty comfortable that we're there. Our store manager turnover, quite frankly, is operating where it had been for a period of time. We are looking at it in terms of -- we look at it, excuse me, in terms of voluntary turnover and involuntary turnover. And obviously, there's a big difference between the 2. And when you add those 2 up, our turnover is around approximately 30%, which is a little high, quite frankly, for retail. I'd like to see that number down in the mid- to low 20s. But also I would tell you that our turnover has been improving over the course of the last 6 to 7 months, and it's continuing to move in a solid direction. So... Scott Mushkin : All right. That's perfect. And if I can just follow up one and maybe -- I know there's transition going on with the leadership and everything, so maybe it's just -- it's too strategic but, obviously, you went for Family Dollar. It didn't work out. When you think about acquisitions or when you think about capital deployment, is acquisitions part of what you consider? Or is it really not -- just kind of one unique situation and not something we look at? Richard Dreiling : Very fair question. And I will tell you, Scott, David and I have always looked at everything. So the answer is nothing is ever off the table. We want to look, we want to understand what we could do to maximize value for our shareholders. And if that opportunity raises itself down the road, I'm sure the management team is going to want to look at it. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Nemer : David, I'll add my congrats as well. I've actually got one question on the quarter, which is I'd love a little bit of color on the seasonal business. It looks like sales per foot were down about 1%. The 2-year stack was down about 6%. Is some of that related to the port? Or are there some other issues there? Richard Dreiling : Todd, go ahead. Todd Vasos : Yes, Matt, this is Todd. So when you look at our seasonal business, first, I want to say it's very healthy. Now when you back down and take a look at the components, the majority of the components are doing very well. The one structural piece that we, as well as probably other retailers, are fighting and battling every day is the toy business. The toy business is embedded in our seasonal business. And structurally, as we all know, that business had been very, very tough over the past few years with electronics and computers and video games and everything else being where -- much more prominent to kids these days than the toys. But we're very happy when we look at seasonal. The team has done a tremendous amount of work on affordability within seasonal. We have about 26%, last year, more $1 items that we had the year before. I can tell you they were squarely focused on the buy this year, which is now complete for holiday of 2015, and that number has been stepped up even more. But our sweet spot, as we said before, is really $1 to $5. But in seasonal, $1 to $3 is really where we play and we do very well in. Matt Nemer : Great. That's helpful. And then, secondly, I was looking to see if we can get some more color on the labor model that Todd mentioned, the new labor model. Is the primary goal to speed up checkout? Or is it more about maintaining the store? Love to get some more color on that and also whether that would be baked in the guidance if you decide to roll it out more broadly this year. Todd Vasos : Yes, Matt, thanks for letting me answer that one. I could tell you that the labor model that we have currently existing in our stores, we look at it each and every day to make sure that, that, in fact, is the right model. Now what we've seen is that in certain geographic areas, we can spend a little bit more time inside of our stores stocking and ensuring the customer experience is at the highest level that it possibly can. So what we've done is strategically taken a group of stores on a test and tested that theory. It tested out very well. And we are in the process, as we roll through 2015, to roll that test broadly out to a large group of our stores over 2015. Once again, it's very targeted to certain stores, but it is a large group of our stores. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So during the conference call, I think it was you, Rick, that mentioned you do anticipate changes in the competitive landscape and obviously, Todd just talked about some of the changes on the labor model. Can you provide some color regarding what kind of changes you're expecting? And is this just on the pending -- any pending changes with Family Dollar, now that's going to be in new hands, or are there other elements that you were referencing? Richard Dreiling : Yes, a fair question, Scot. I think that obviously the #1 thing on our radar screen is the change that is taking place between Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Once again, the big-box guys are now announcing more initiatives. And what we're trying to do is just stay focused on absolutely everything that's out there. Now while we can only control what we can control, we have -- the beauty of our model is it takes a little bit from a lot of different spots rather than having to grab everything from one spot. So consequently, we stay focused on what absolutely everybody is doing. And yes, I didn't mean to send any unjust or unneeded fear or anything, but we're staying very focused on what everybody is doing. There's a lot of moving parts out there right now. Scot Ciccarelli : So just a general expectation that it's going to be a dynamic competitive environment? Richard Dreiling : Yes, just the fact that there's a lot of new faces managing new assets, right? Scot Ciccarelli : Yes. Okay. Fair enough. And then my follow-up is any -- I guess, David, you talked a little about the EBIT margin opportunity down the road. Can you provide a little bit more color why you're expecting EBIT margins then to be flat to down this year, what -- versus what, frankly, seems to be a bit of an easy comparison following 4 straight years of kind of 10%-plus EBIT margins? Is it some of that's labor investment? Or is it just the continued mix shift on -- impact on the gross margin, et cetera? David Tehle : Yes, the biggest piece is clearly the labor investment that we're making in our SG&A line, and that really is the bulk of the story there. Again, we expect better performance than we saw in 2013 and 2014 on the gross margin, given some of the product category headwinds we had from tobacco in those years, cycling over that. And then I mentioned we continue to like what we're seeing in shrink, getting some improvement there, and then category management and foreign sourcing helping us. But it's the investment in labor that we're making. Mary Winn Pilkington : All right. I think that will conclude our call today. We have a new member of our IR team in Matt Hancock, and some -- I know some of you had a chance to meet Matt. If you haven't had a chance to meet him, I look forward to introducing to -- you to him. And we'll be around today for calls, so I know we will left some people in the queue, so please feel free to give me a call. Thank you. Operator, that will now conclude our call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you would please disconnect all lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, my name is Hope, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Today is Tuesday, June 2, 2015. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Hope, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Vasos, our COO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com, under Investor Information, Press Releases. Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2015 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2015 operating initiatives and merchandising initiatives; our 2015 and 2016 store growth initiatives; our share repurchase expectations; and capital allocation strategy and statements regarding future consumer economic trends. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2014 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2015, our 2015 first quarter 10-Q filed this morning; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Last week, we had very exciting news announcing that Todd Vasos would be the next CEO of Dollar General. Todd will be an excellent CEO and I believe a great future lies ahead for Dollar General under his leadership. I have worked side-by-side with Todd for many years. And I know firsthand his ability to be both strategic and tactical, to not only visualize success, but put together the right team with the right strategy to make it happen.  At Dollar General, I have loved our spirit of service and our passion for taking care of our customers, helping our employees grow and giving back to our communities. Working with this team has been incredibly rewarding and although this will be my last earnings conference call, I am excited to have the opportunity to remain as Chairman until the end of the fiscal year to support Todd as we drive the business. With that, let's now turn to our results for the first quarter of 2015. This quarter is a very good start to the new year as we look to capitalize on the numerous opportunities ahead of us. Let's recap some of the highlights of the first quarter of 2015. First quarter sales increased 8.8% to $4.9 billion. We delivered same-store sales growth of 3.7% for the quarter. Overall, we were pleased with the sales cadence for the quarter, particularly in light of the Easter holiday shift to earlier in the year. In the quarter, same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and non-consumables. The non-consumable categories have now had 5 consecutive quarters of improvement, with seasonal apparel and home all comping positive in the first quarter. I am pleased with the progress we've made in our non-consumable categories. For the 29th consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket. Gross margin expanded by 45 basis points to 30.5%, which is our first margin expansion in 9 quarters. From a timing perspective, this generally coincides with our launch of tobacco in early 2013. Net income for the first quarter increased 14% to $253 million. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.84. In the first quarter, the negative financial impact from the West Coast port slowdown was not as great as we had anticipated. Due to the diligent work across both our supply chain and merchandising teams, we successfully mitigated the expected drag to sales and gross margin we had projected at the time of the fourth quarter call. During the quarter, we returned $600 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 7.1 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. Given our performance in the first quarter, we are maintaining our sales and earnings guidance for the year.  We are constantly striving to fill the need to meet the changing demands of our customers. As we entered the year, I shared with you that we were cautiously optimistic for our core customer, as there appeared to be potential for tailwinds to outweigh the headwinds from macro trends. Even if gas prices have moved up from their recent lows year-over-year, gas prices are still off about $1 a gallon or down nearly 30% from last year's peak. Recent economic news includes unemployment claims falling to their lowest level in 15 years, with many economists believing that the U.S. is approaching full employment. So while this is encouraging news, our core customer is still struggling to stretch their household budget. Historically, our core customer is often the first to feel the negative effects when the economy weakens and she lags in benefiting from improvements in the economy. As always, we will continue to look for ways to provide our customers with the everyday low prices that they can count on from Dollar General. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Todd, to talk about our operating initiatives for 2015. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Rick. Let me first say how excited and honored I am to have the privilege to lead Dollar General. I'm grateful that Rick will remain as Chairman, as his guidance and counsel will be incredibly valuable to me. Turning to the first quarter, we have made notable progress against our key initiatives for 2015. We continue to grow transactions and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced consistent mid- to high single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. As we shared with you last quarter, we are on track to meet targeted labor investments to grow market share in a competitive environment, while providing for positive financial returns. Currently, we are in the midst of rolling out these selected labor investments in phases. We have 3 phases within the program. Our Phase 1 stores are now receiving the incremental labor investments. The store operations team has specific metrics and timetable for determining the financial return criteria for achieving results based on a similar 2014 test and learn program. Our 2014 test and learn stores continue to show improvement across performance metrics such as sales, shrink, in-stock, which are all very encouraging. The great part of this initiative is that we can be nimble in making adjustments to the model as appropriate. Based on the 2014 test results and the early results of Phase 1, we are very encouraged by our progress. We anticipate rolling this investment to the Phase 2 and Phase 3 stores in the second half of the year.  The labor hour investment in this select group of stores is designed to ensure we deliver on our consumer expectations in more competitive markets, with product in-stock and a convenient shopping experience. Our goal is to reduce the truck-to-shelf time for merchandise in these stores, further supporting our goal of providing our consumer with the right product at the right time and at the right price.  The second investment in labor comes from the realignment of our store operations management structure to optimize the scale of our divisions, regions and districts to improve accountability and maximize mentorship and teamwork, all while driving stronger, more sustainable results. While reducing the average number of stores per district and optimizing their scale, we have reduced the time our district managers spend driving, so they can invest more time mentoring and coaching our store managers on developing and strengthening their teams. These changes have been in place since February. While it's still early, our operational structure is better aligned for our field leaders to focus on store standards and ultimately, create a better and more consistent shopping experience for our consumers. Our expectation is that over time, this should help both our consumer satisfaction and our store manager turnover.  In addition, over the last several months, we've been testing a number of inventory management initiatives. For example, a new sky shelf program has been rolled out across 1/3 of the chain to allow for the placement of inventory directly above respective categories. This allows our teams to get product out of the back room to facilitate improved stocking and ultimately, drive labor efficiencies. To date, we are pleased with the test results and are planning on expanding the sky shelf program chain-wide. We expect the rollout to be completed by the third quarter of 2015.  On a combined basis, we believe these labor investments and inventory management initiatives are significant steps to improving our in-stock position, which is critical component of our overall consumer satisfaction and a driver of sales performance. On the merchandising front, we had balanced same-store sales growth across all categories in the first quarter. Strength in consumables was driven by tobacco, perishables, health care and candy and snacks. In addition, we had broad-based strength across apparel with our ladies, men's and boys, infants and shoes continuing to exhibit strong performance, with all these departments comping in line or above the company average.  Seasonal and home comps trends were very encouraging as well. Affordability is playing a key role as we look to expand SKUs across the store at our sweet spot of $1 to $5. For the first quarter, nearly 50% of our consumers' baskets contained at least one item priced at $1.  Our Fast Way to Save digital coupon program is growing. Sign-ups are increasing. And as we exited the quarter, our redemption rate for digital coupons continued to improve. During the quarter, we executed our Fast Way to Save Spring Into Savings event, which had strong activity for the program. Measured on a weekly basis, redemptions, trips and sign-ups by consumers all improved during this promotion. In addition, sales in participating items significantly outpaced their respective categories and our overall comp sales. We have embarked on the next phase of our offering by providing personalized coupons for our consumers based on their purchase behavior. We are able to use the data captured from this program like a loyalty card, but without the incremental cost. For instance, we plan to use these insights from a consumer shopping trip to customize individual promotions, which we believe will ultimately drive incremental trips and larger baskets. The data we gather also allows us to target media to these consumers in order to reach them more effectively and efficiently. Shrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reducing our shrink at store level. For the quarter, we are very pleased with our shrink improvement. The progress is broad-based, with 19 of our 24 product departments showing improvement. For store inventories performed so far this year, approximately 70% of our regions also improved year-over-year. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to reduce shrink.  In order to enhance our productivity gains, we are once again elevating the category management process. We are optimizing all areas of the store beyond the planograms to include off-shelf and end-cap displays. Additionally, we are collaborating with our vendor partners through our joint business planning process to develop our merchandising plans and activities even further out on the calendar to enhance our consumer shopping experience. Over the last several years, we have made significant strides in the productivity of our planograms through SKU selection and ongoing refinement. Our affordability philosophy is fully ingrained in our category management process. As a result, we have established a strong foundation in our planograms that we can redefine periodically. We are concentrated on simplifying work at the store by reducing the complexity of planogram resets and capturing labor savings that can be reinvested.  At Dollar General, real estate -- the real estate model is disciplined and focused on financial returns. We continue to see new store productivity at around 85% of our comp base, all while driving strong returns. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2015, as our pipeline is full.  The Dollar General stores in our 3 new states of Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon, are off to a good start and their sales performance continues to accelerate. We have driven down the capital investments required for remodels, while also driving strong sales lifts of 4% to 5%, and an improved return on investment in excess of 200 basis points. The real estate team is well on its way in building the pipeline for 2016. The planned growth in selling square feet of approximately 7% translates to approximately 900 new store openings. Our development pipeline is nearly 50% complete for planned 2016 store openings. We have released additional strategic trade areas to our real estate team and are experiencing increased deal velocity. We have a strong track record of delivering exceptional returns in our new store program and are confident in our model going forward.  In today's environment, we are extremely focused on doing everything we can to provide our customers with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. We continue to be committed as ever to providing our consumers with the everyday low price they know and trust. Now David will share a more detailed review of our first quarter financial performance and our outlook. David Tehle : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Rick and Todd have taken you through the highlights of our first quarter and many of our strategic initiatives, so I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results, starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.5 billion or 30.5% of sales, an increase of 45 basis points from last year's first quarter. As compared to the prior year, the most significant drivers were higher initial inventory markups, better inventory shrink performance and lower transportation costs.  SG&A expense increased by 13 basis points over the 2014 period to $1.1 billion or 21.8% of sales in the first quarter. The majority of the SG&A increase was due primarily to higher incentive compensation, advertising costs and repairs and maintenance. Partially offsetting these items were increased cash-back-related convenience fees. Our tax rate for the quarter was generally flat to last year at 37.7%. Moving now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $2.8 billion, up 9% in total and 3% on a per-store basis. We generated cash from operations of $344 million in the quarter, an increase of $92 million compared to the first quarter of 2014.  During the quarter, we repurchased 7.1 million shares of our common stock for $535 million. We also paid our first dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding totaling $66 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased over $2.8 billion of our common stock. We currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $689 million. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We aim to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment grade rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt-to-EBITDA. Now turning to guidance. Looking forward, we continue to expect top line sales for 2015 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall, selling square footage is expected to grow approximately 6% and same-store sales are expected to increase by 3% to 3.5%. We also continue to expect operating profit growth to be in the range of 7% to 9% over adjusted 2014 operating profit. Our expectation for diluted earnings per share remains $3.85 to $3.95 for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. For the year, we plan to open approximately 730 new stores and relocate or remodel 875 stores. Further, we plan to open approximately 900 stores in 2016.  Consistent with our plans as we enter the year, we would expect stronger growth rates in the first half of 2015, given that our laps are more challenging in the second half of the year. As our long-term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers in a wide variety of economic conditions, and in turn, deliver strong results for our shareholders over time.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick. Richard Dreiling : Thank you, David. As this is our last earnings call together, please accept my many thanks for your friendship and business partnership. What you've done over your career at Dollar General has been significant, from taking the company private in 2007 to our return to the public markets in 2009. You've been instrumental in transforming Dollar General and in fueling our impressive growth. For all of us at Dollar General, thank you for all you've done over the last 11 years. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. Even as the competitive landscape continues to evolve, we have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividends.  To all of the 109,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our customers with convenience, value and service every day, please accept my appreciation and thanks.  With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open up the call to Todd and David for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Okay. Hope, we'll take the first call, please. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : And congrats, Todd, and also congrats to you on the successful transition, Rick -- Rick and David. Richard Dreiling : Thank you. Paul Trussell : So just want to talk about cadence. Rick, you spoke to being pleased with the sales cadence. Could you please help us understand how you started and ended the period from a same-store sales standpoint and quantify any impact from any one-off headwinds, such as the earlier Easter, whether there was an impact, note that's notable from weather or West Coast ports? And also, on sales, David reiterated the guidance regarding the first half better than the second half. Just any other color as we should be thinking about the second quarter trend to-date would be helpful. Todd Vasos : Yes, Paul, this is Todd, let me first say that the first quarter sales trajectory and trend were pretty much exactly like we thought they would be. Obviously, we knew the calendar. We knew that the Easter shift would play a key factor in how the quarter shaped up and it played out exactly the way we really thought it would and that was benefiting period 2 of the quarter and then taken away some sales in period 3. So the quarter shaped up pretty much like we thought. There was some headwind, as you indicated, with a little weather that we saw, just like everyone else, I'm sure, in that latter part of February, early March time frame. But as that subsided and mitigated, our sales returned to a more normalized pattern and again, where we thought. And as we look forward, Paul, we're pretty satisfied and confident in our guidance of sales that we put out at the beginning of the year. So I think the best way to look at it is that we're well on track to be within that guidance. Paul Trussell : Now on gross margins, very good performance there, could you give a little bit more detail on what is driving the higher mark-ups? And are there any headwinds that we should be thinking about going forward that could offset some of the improvement in shrink and lower transportation cost? Todd Vasos : Paul, we're very pleased with our gross margin performance. I think the teams did an outstanding job and to call out a few of the teams in supply chain and merchandising in particular, they did a real good job in mitigating some of that West Coast issue that we were facing and they did it over a course of a long period of time. As they saw this start to materialize, they made some very early changes late last year to move some goods to the East Coast, and that really helped us. Then as we looked at the quarter, the mix really did benefit us. And as you heard from the prepared remarks, we were very happy with our sales and our sales trajectories in non-consumables. And so as you look at the non-consumable piece, it helped our margin as we looked year-over-year. DC and trans did a nice job, as I indicated, not only on the West Coast piece, but also, they continue working their productivity gains within the DCs, as well as looking at how we mitigate any issues with some of the driver shortages that have been out there. Again, our teams, I think, have done a pretty good job with that. And of course, fuel helped a little bit, as it is much lower than last year. And then lastly, we're very, very encouraged by our shrink results and our trajectory on shrink. We think that the work that's been done over the last 12 to 18 months has some legs to it. And we're seeing it broad-based, as we indicated, across many, many categories. So we feel pretty good. But as you look, just to keep in mind, gross margins, the headwinds get a little bit tougher and the laps get a little tougher as we move through the quarter -- sorry, through the rest of the year and into the upcoming quarter. So keep that in mind as you take a look at that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now go to Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Congrats to everybody on the new roles and moving on. I want to talk a little bit more about the labor investment that you're making. Can you give us some sense of the economic return that you've seen from the test? And how scalable you think that the return will be and what form it will be? Is it mostly going to be a sales lift? Todd Vasos : Yes, Michael, it's Todd once again. I think the best way to look at it is that, our operations teams have a real defined metric goal that they need to reach. And as we indicated, it is goals around sales being the #1 driver. The whole thought around this is to make sure that our in-store experience for the consumer is top-notch as she enters our stores. And as we've said for the last couple of calls, this labor investment at store level is about getting product on the shelf, about getting out of the back room and getting the truck work in a more timely manner, so that as the consumer enters the store, she has what she needs on the shelf at the time she needs it and can get out of the store quickly. So there definitely is metrics involved and we're pretty pleased with what we see so far. But again, it's early. But we're pretty pleased and look forward to rolling out Phases 2 and 3 of the program as we work through the rest of the year. Michael Lasser : And so should we -- I appreciate your commentary about the comparisons getting tougher, but with the labor investment, should we expect that some of the comparison will be mitigated by the sales lift that you anticipate you'll achieve through this initiative? Todd Vasos : Yes, and I think that's fair to say. But again, we knew going into the year as we laid our guidance, we've layered that in as being a benefit for us. But I think might be you're exactly right. It's fair to say that, that should help us as we move into the back half of the year. Michael Lasser : Okay. And then my last question, Todd, is you mentioned some headwinds that you're going to be facing, aside from tough compares on the gross margin side. What exactly are you referring to on the gross margin headwinds? And so should we, should not expect that the 45 basis points of expansion is necessarily achievable -- sustainable? Todd Vasos : Yes, I think the way to look at it is one, we're fairly confident that we will have expansion for the year. But as we continue to move throughout the year, the compares get a little tougher to last year and that rate of growth with gross margin will subside somewhat as we continue to move. But we feel pretty confident that we'll have expansion as we move through the rest of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So on the top line, this 3% to 3.5% same-store sales guidance for the year, it appears prudent, given the tougher compares as the year progresses. My question, have you baked in any changes in macro backdrop with some of the wage increases? And then from a category perspective, what areas of the store would you expect to outpace that guide over the next 12 months? Todd Vasos : Well, as we look at it, we really haven't factored anything for the wages and we watch all trends in retail, and wages being one of them, and I think we've got a pretty strong track record of doing what we need to do at the time we need to do it. And the nice thing about Dollar General is we have the flexibility to be able to do that. So we feel pretty confident in that. But we'll watch it. And as we look at sales as we move through the rest of the year, the work that the teams have done in non-consumables, I have to tell you, we feel very good about that. And again, that work has been ongoing for years, Matt, as you know. And as we've always said, as the consumer starts to have a little bit more money, we think that we've got the right formula for her on non-consumables. So we still consider non-consumables as a great rounding out of the basket. And I think Q1 showed that. And I think as we move through the rest of the year, our non-consumable categories will continue to perform very well for us. Matthew Boss : Great. And then can you just talk about what you're seeing in the competitive environment? And particularly any changes that you've noticed with some of your peers currently under transition today? Todd Vasos : Yes, I think the -- when you look at the macro environment out there in retail, it's always very competitive. But I think the best way to still characterize it is it's been very rational across all channels of trade, mass, grocery and drug. And we watch, just like everyone, we watch everything everyone's doing and we'll act accordingly. But I have to tell you, at this point, we really haven't seen anything that is out of the ordinary. But we're doing -- and we're doing things and we're controlling what we can control and working our plan. And where we think the year is going to fall out and that's where we're squarely focused. And if we keep our head down and do that, and then also watch what's going on around us, I think we're going to have a pretty good year here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Two questions. First of all, you've made a couple of comments just regarding in-stock levels and one of the reasons you're increasing the labor investment is to improve the in-stock level to make sure the stores are prepared. so I guess the question is, do you think you've had an issue with in-stock levels, first? And then second, just kind of, again, this is a broader macro question, I guess, but a lot of the data out there suggests that blue collar labor trends continue to improve. We're starting to see some upward pressure on wages, which I would think would create a good environment for Dollar General. I'm wondering how you would characterize the health of your core consumer at this point? Todd Vasos : Sure. Scot, I think it's fair to say, on the in-stock piece, that we haven't been fully satisfied with where our in-stocks have been and been trending. In saying that, I think we've done some very prudent things and taken some actions, as you heard in my prepared remarks, to offset some of those in-stock issues that we've seen start to pop up over the last 12 to 18 months. Now in saying that, we've got a lot of things in place to make sure that our in-stock levels are appropriate. But as you can tell, we do have some opportunities still. So we're working that plan and stay tuned for more information as we continue to move through the year on it. But we're confident that we'll be able to reel that in and get our in-stocks back to where we think they should be. As it relates to our core consumer, I think you nailed it. I think that the consumer is feeling a little bit better. But again, our core consumer is always a little bit stretched. And as you know, she is the first, usually, to start to feel it, when the economy starts to go a little sideways and she's also the last to usually roll out of that, when she starts to go back to work and things start to get a little better. But I think the way to look at it is that she also has to feel confident over a longer period of time. And I think as we continue to move through the year and if everything stays where it's at or gets a little bit better, her confidence level is going to build and her spending will probably build with that. Because again, she is -- she doesn't have a lot of disposable income, she doesn't have bank accounts and credit cards. And so she has to see a sustained time where she starts to feel good and once that happens, I think you'll start to see her spend a little bit more. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Daniel Binder : And congratulations to both of you, Rick and Todd. My question was a follow-up on this labor investment. Can you just remind us how many stores were in the test? How many that were on Phase 1? And then considering the investments you're making where we... Mary Winn Pilkington : Dan, did we lose you? [Technical Difficulty] Operator : His line disconnected. Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne Agee. Charles Grom : On the 2014 labor initiatives, I don't know if it was really his question actually, but on the 2014 test that you did, can you just give us some perspective on how many stores that you tested it in and what the degree of improvement was in your in-stock levels, and also from a sales perspective, what the lift was? Todd Vasos : Yes, when we rolled out the 2014 test, Chuck, I think it's fair to say it was a done in a pretty big group of stores and it was done across a lot of different geographic areas of the country to make sure that we felt good about the results that were coming out of it. So in our test and learn program, as you know, using APT, we have the unique ability to be able to really focus in on that. And then glean the learnings from it. So it was broad based in a lot of different geographic areas, but I think the biggest thing to take away was that we saw significant sales increases that were sustainable. And as well as our in-stock positions had increased. And what we're waiting for to come through on this as well, that will be a trailer to both the '14 test and anything we do in '15, we're hoping to get some shrink goodness out of this as we continue to move as well. But again, that will be yet to come and we won't probably recognize that until later this year and into early next year. Charles Grom : Okay, great. And then just to dovetail into that, David, when we think about SG&A dollar growth in the balance of the year, 9.5% here in the first quarter, should we think about that rising as we roll out the labor initiatives to more stores? David Tehle : Yes, I think as we look at it, we still believe it takes approximately a 3.5% comp on an ongoing basis to lever our SG&A. Now having said that, that ebbs and flows and it depends upon what our investments in, in a particular quarter, and obviously, we were a little higher in Q1 on incentive comp, advertising and repairs and maintenance. And yes, as we go through the back half of the year, we will be making some investments in labor that will reduce the leverage in terms of how much we can lever SG&A. And as Todd said, we think that's a great investment, but it takes a little bit of time to get that payback as customers, obviously, the hope is we'll get more transactions and a bigger basket as customer -- customers come into the store and that will come over time. So again, big expectations for it. But as we're implementing it, the back half of the year puts a little pressure on SG&A. Charles Grom : Okay. Great. And then one more for you David, just on the cash flow statement, it looks like you had some help on the payables front, an increase from the end of the year, when it looks like typically over the past few years, you guys see a decline. Just wondering why the payable balance rose so much. David Tehle : Yes, 2 things there. Last year, on payables, we had a little bit of a negative and this year, we had a little bit of a positive, the same items, that had to do with the receipts. And we talked about the West Coast situation and this year, we got a whole slug of receipts in rather late in the quarter that we didn't have to pay for right away and last year, we got receipts a little bit earlier that we paid for a little quicker. So a little bit of hurt last year and a little bit of help this year. Put them together, it was an enough to, as you say, kind of stick out of the cash flow statement. Charles Grom : Okay, great. And congrats on your retirement. David Tehle : Thank you. Operator : We do have Dan Binder back online with Jefferies. Daniel Binder : Anyway, so I did have some other questions, though. You recently opened your 12,000th store. Maybe you can give us a little bit of an update based on kind of the white space and the opportunities, competitive environment, what you think the opportunity is for Dollar General here? Todd Vasos : Yes, we think the opportunity is very bright. We've stated that we've got 13,000 opportunities that exist in the continental United States. We know we'll get our very fair share of those. As a matter of fact, as we've already announced, we've accelerated our growth to ensure that we get the very best sites that are out there. So we feel very good about the white spaces there still. And we feel good about the new states that we've entered and where those sales trends are moving. So all in all, the future is pretty bright when you look at store -- building stores and store expansion and our future expansion plans. Daniel Binder : Okay. And then just one other question. On -- you talked about better in-stock levels. I'm not sure if you want to quantify, but what is sort of the ideal economical level of in-stocks that you think you want to be at longer term? And maybe if you could also include in that conversation how much of the inventory is being pushed to the stores versus pulled? Is it all central replenishment? Or do they have -- do store managers have some flexibility to request product, too? Todd Vasos : Yes, those are good questions. And when we look at inventory levels, there is no doubt that we do have specific goals in mind by category and even down to the goods themselves. So in our top 250 items, we want 99%-plus in-stocks. And as you go down the food chain, if you will, on items, that expectation becomes a little less because we know that we're not -- we wouldn't want to be 99% in-stock across the board. But in saying that, our consumers expect a very high level of in-stock when they come into the store. And we feel that by making sure that we've got the product on the shelf and again, implementing the sky shelf program as I indicated, will help keep that -- those goods out of the back room and customer-facing. So those are some of the initiatives we're working on to make sure that those in-stock levels stay pretty high. And then when you look at just overall, our inventory, we feel that it's pretty clean and we feel good about it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : Todd, I wanted to ask you about your thoughts on private label opportunities. So when we look at competitors such as Aldi, obviously, remarkably successful, with almost 100% private brand assortment. And I'm assuming that Family Dollar's private label assortment will grow once it becomes a part of Dollar Tree. So when you think about Dollar General, do you see an opportunity to further push your private label penetration higher? Or do you think just the opposite, to differentiate yourself from those competitors, perhaps, focus more on branded product? Todd Vasos : Yes, those are good questions. We very much love private brands. We know that they are definitely a pillar of our inventory that we have. As a matter of fact, our consumers look to us for a great alternative in private brand. So to answer your question specifically, we look to continue to expand our private brands, not only the items, but also the quality that we put forward to the consumer. And we also want to make sure that it's an extreme value for our consumer. The other lever that we have that we continue to expand and you'll see a further expansion as we go through '15, will be our Smart & Simple label, which in fact gets us to even a lower price point for our customer, to really hit that affordability piece that she craves right now, especially in a lot of the consumable type areas. So we're bullish about our private brand program and you'll continue to see us move forward and expand that as we move into the latter part of this year and to next. Daniel Wewer : And just, Todd, one follow-up question, with the 900 stores opening next year, I don't think a retailer has ever opened that many stores in a year, is it your experience that Dollar General finds that first-year volumes are greater when you're the first small box value retailer in a market? Is that the key reason why you're pushing the expansion rate higher? Todd Vasos : Yes, the way we look at it is, first of all, 900 stores is a big number, but our real estate team is very, very good at what they do. We're confident in the site selection and that's probably the most important thing around volume, is getting the right site and our proprietary tools that we use really hones in those sites for us and enables us to get there. Now there is no doubt that being first-mover does give you some advantage. And we'll continue to capitalize on any dislocation that may be out there. But 900 stores is aggressive, but we feel very confident in delivering that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citigroup. Alvin Concepcion : I think you touched upon personalizing promotions. I'm just curious how far away are you from being able to do that? And are you partnering with anyone on the data analytics? Todd Vasos : To answer your question specifically, we were already doing targeted marketing based on purchase habits from our consumers on that card. Again, the beauty of this is it looks and feels like a loyalty card, but it has none of that backstage cost that is very prohibitive out there. So we are partnering with many of the CPG companies, and quite frankly, the majority of them are very, very excited about partnering with us to offer our consumers a real deal on these digital coupon platforms. But what they're even more jazzed about, if you will, is the ability to seed them, based on their purchase history, with coupons that are very relevant to them. And we're pretty happy with the early results of it, and you're going to see a lot more from us as we move over the next few quarters. Alvin Concepcion : Great. And just another one about operating profits. I think it grew about 13% in the quarter. Your guidance is 7% to 9% for the year. I know there's some comparisons in the back half of the year. I'm wondering, is there some conservatism built into that as well? And how much of it is from labor investments incrementally stepping up? Just wondering if you could help us through the puts and takes on margins over the course of the year? David Tehle : Yes, well, clearly, it is early in the year. We've only been through one quarter and as you said, the comparisons do get a little more difficult as we get in the second half the year. So I think let's just stay tuned on that one and we'll see how it all plays out. We are making more investment in labor as we go through the year, talked about that. And again, we believe we'll have a great return on that. It's just going to take a little while for us to get that return. Alvin Concepcion : And last one for me, I'm just wondering if you could talk about direct sourcing as an opportunity in 2015, just an update there? Todd Vasos : Yes, again, direct sourcing is one of our key pillars of gross margin and gross margin expansion, but also offers our consumers a real value and affordability in that sweet spot of $1 to $5. So we want to continue and we will continue to grow our global sourcing efforts. And as we move through 2015 and into next year, we continue to put satellite offices in more countries around the globe to make sure that we have boots on the street and really finding the next best factories that can deliver that promise to the consumer. So we're full speed ahead on global sourcing. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Nemer : First, I'm wondering if you can give us any read, early read, on the repackaging of your private brands. I think the goal was to have most of those in store by mid-year. And I'm wondering if you're getting any sales lift from that? Todd Vasos : Yes, Matt, as we look at the private brand repackaging and just the effort, in general, it's way early to give a real solid read on it. But I can tell you that half of the goods that we repackaged by about mid-year, and then the remainder 90% will be done probably by the end of the second and into the early third quarter. But the early read has been fairly positive. When we look at it, we are looking at it by item, by category. And there are a few changes that we've made already based on that. But overall, the consumer response has been very positive. And again, we did a lot, which we always do, a lot of consumer work before we launched each and every one of those items. So we had a real good idea of what it would do and it's coming very, very close to what we thought. But just like anything, there's always a little bit of back-and-forth that we need to do and a few items that we're changing as we speak. Matt Nemer : Got it, okay. And then on a separate topic, the digital coupon platform, can you give us a sense for how many of your customers have signed up for that or maybe the percent of baskets that are using a digital coupon? Just so we can kind of gauge the size of that -- that effort right now? Todd Vasos : We really, Matt, haven't quantified that. But I could tell you that we've got goals and metrics in place to hit and we are on actually exceeding those sign-ups already through Q1 and now as we go into Q2. And as you heard, we're launching different programs in each quarter to encourage sign-up and to get people really involved in it. So stay tuned, more to come on that, because it's in its infancy stage, but we think it's a real differentiator for our channel. Matt Nemer : Okay. That's fair. And then just lastly, on the sky shelf initiative, is that more about the flow of inventory through the store, or adding safety stock to the store? And if it's the latter, how does that impact inventory dollars per store over time? Todd Vasos : Yes, Matt, it really is the first. And that is, it facilitates getting product out of that back room and getting it right in front of the customer. Our store teams do a fabulous job day in and day out taking care of our customers. We want to make it easier for them. And the easiest way to stock the goods on the shelf would not be to go back in the back room and have to find it, but to be able to look right above the items and be able to stock it very effectively and efficiently that way. And that was really the impetus behind us doing that, was to make it easier on the stores. Now the byproduct of that is better in-stocks, because once again, if you see an aisle and you happen to be passing by the aisles, you may not have time in the way we did it in the past, to run in the back room to get the item, but you know what, you definitely have time to stop for a few seconds, look up and if it's there, pull a few down and put it on the shelf. So I think it's going to kill 2 birds with one stone and make things a lot easier for the stores, but also be able to enhance our in-stock position. Richard Dreiling : If anything, from a working capital point of view, it should reduce working capital, because it will be out there, you'll get it on the shelf quicker, it will sell quicker, and it should, in no way, will it add inventory. It's just being more efficient with the inventory and actually, hopefully, making it turn even quicker. Matt Nemer : Makes a lot of sense. Todd, congrats on your new role. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : I wanted to follow up on corporate brand topic. So how satisfied do you think you are with corporate brand pricing, particularly versus the hard discounters? And then with Smart & Simple, how much do you think -- will there be a Smart & Simple alternative in every category and subcategory? And if so, where do you get the shelf space for that, is that national brand or more facings? Todd Vasos : John, a couple of good questions. Number one, we look at pricing, whether it's national brand or private brand, across the entire spectrum of where we do business, every 2 weeks. So we're very, very attuned to pricing. And we feel pretty confident on both our national brand, but especially our private brand pricing, as it relates to mass grocery and drug. Now in saying that, well, we continue to watch pricing as national brands get -- may get more aggressive. We also then make sure that we watch our spreads between national brand and private brands. And at those times, we'll reduce our prices if need be to keep those spreads. But as you look at our private brands and the way that we're looking at them, Smart & Simple does play a key role in that affordability piece. And I wouldn't say that we're going to have it in every single category. But I can tell you that right now, the 45 or 50 items that we launched this year or late last year and into this year, has been very, very good for us. The consumer has -- has resonated with the consumer. They like the value and the affordability that Smart & Simple offers, with a pretty good promise on the quality of the item. So stay tuned, John. I think you're going to see an acceleration of Smart & Simple as we go forward, because we know that it's a true differentiator for us, but also it really helps the consumer. John Heinbockel : And then lastly, as a follow-up, if you think about -- I mean, your share is still very small in any of your categories. Where is the best opportunity to drive, think beyond 2015, investing in more labor investing and price, is there enough elasticity if you invest in price to drive some of that share? How do you look at the 2 versus each other? Todd Vasos : Well, we look at both all the time. And we look at the marketplace all the time. And I think you know us pretty well. If we feel that we need to invest in labor, we do. If we feel like we need to invest in price, we do. The real key, and we've said it many, many times, is driving units. If we drive units through the store and those transactions, then comps sales come. So we're confident in that model and the nice thing is we have the flexibility, and we've proven that over time, to be able to take whatever action we need to take to make sure that we continue to drive market share. And by the way, our market share continues to grow, as you heard, and we don't see that stopping, because we've got a real good strong category management plan out there that will leverage up on a lot of different areas to be able to drive that market share. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : This is actually just a follow-up on an earlier comment on the non-consumables. Can you just provide a little more detail on what has changed in apparel, specifically to drive the better results and maybe what are some of the ongoing initiatives that will continue to be benefiting this part of the mix? Todd Vasos : Yes, that's a great question. A few things, and we've been working on apparel for many years, but Cindy Long and her team have done a phenomenal job in getting this very, very relevant in apparel. And when we look at apparel, it's both basics and then fashion basics. We're not out there on the cutting-edge of fashion, but fashion basics is really where Cindy and her team have brought us. And the consumer is really resonating. And then as we took her learnings from that, and then put in the affordability pieces that we've now ingrained within our category management process to include apparel, the consumers have really, really responded to that. So we are -- we're pretty bullish on apparel. I don't think any of us would have probably said that a few years ago. But I can tell you that the team has done some real nice work there and we see that only enhancing as we continue to move through the rest of this year. Stephen Grambling : Great, that's helpful. And then maybe changing gears. I realize oftentimes you don't comment on these specifically, but can you just talk to your thought process more generally about evaluating acquisitions? Todd Vasos : We've always said, and David can also chime in here. We'll look at anything that may be out there. But the great thing about our model is that, and you've heard me a little earlier, we've got 13,000 or so opportunities in the continental United States alone. So we're very, very focused on that organic growth right now. But never say never. And we're always going to look at everything. But we feel very confident in our real estate model and where we're headed right now. Stephen Grambling : Thanks, best of luck in the new role. Todd Vasos : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : And so I guess my question is more as we look out. I mean, obviously, this year is going kind of on plan and maybe even a little bit better. But as we move out to next year and we talk about the labor investments, got another competitor of yours now upping the starting salaries to $10, so it's going to put some probably further pressure on that labor line. Plus the 900 stores, it just seems as I kind of look at '17, it looks a little harder from my perspective. And I wanted you to talk me out of that. Todd Vasos : Yes, I think it's fair to say that we've got a very, very strong plan that we're executing against for this year. We've already laid plans for 2016. Stay tuned. I think you're going to be pretty happy as we continue to move through this. We've proven that we can continue to move comp sales. We've proven that we can continue to balance the P&L pretty strong and still return a lot to the shareholders. And I think that you're going to continue to see that from us. But -- and as it relates to the wages, we're continuing to monitor that. We monitor everything out there in retail and wages are no different. But keep in mind, we still have a lot of flexibility. And the real hallmark of a great retailer is the ability to drive productivity at store level and we'll continue to do that. And if we can continue to do that, it will afford us that flexibility to do whatever we need to do to be competitive. Scott Mushkin : And then just one follow-up. I noticed -- I think your rent growth is close to 15% last year. As we accelerate the stores, and obviously, we're at the kind of tail end of the -- it looks like economic cycle, at least more at the end, how is rent growth? How should we think about rent growth going forward? Is it harder to get space as you're paying more? Or no? David Tehle : Yes, I think, and again, we don't give specific guidance on individual line items, but we have an extremely sophisticated, effective real estate process, as Todd mentioned earlier, and we're very pleased with what we see out of that. We believe we're getting the lowest rent possible for somebody in our space. We're happy with what we're driving there. And again, it's all about productivity in the box. As we look at the individual boxes, if we're dealing with a little higher rent, then we've got to figure out how to make that box more productive to pay for that rent. And again, I think we've got a lot of programs to do that, also. So it's just part of the evolution of our model as we move forward. And I think we've got a lot of strategies to help offset those higher rents. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you. I know we're leaving some people in the queue, so I apologize about that, but Matt Hancock and I will be around to take any calls. So please feel free to give me a call, and thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Brandy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, August 27, 2015. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Brandy, and good morning everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and John Garratt, our interim CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open the call up for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com, under Investor Information, Press Releases.  Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2015 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures, our planned fiscal 2015 and 2016 operating and merchandising initiatives, 2015 and 2016 store growth and prototype initiatives, our capital allocation strategy and expectations and expectations regarding future economic trends.  Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2014 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2015, our 2015 second quarter 10-Q filed this morning and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call.  Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Mary Winn. And thanks for everyone joining the call today. This morning, we announced our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Once again, we delivered strong financial performance for the quarter. I believe we have further opportunity to take significant steps to better execute our initiatives to serve our consumers and build on our strong foundation for future growth.  I am excited to say we have strengthened our leadership team with Jeff Owen, EVP of Store Operations and Jim Thorpe, EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer, rejoining Dollar General. Both Jeff and Jim have a proven record of driving results at Dollar General and know our company and our consumer extremely well. Getting this team back together should strengthen our ability to move at an accelerated pace.  With that, let's now turn to our results for the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter sales increased nearly 8% to $5.1 billion. We received -- we've delivered, excuse me, same-store sales growth of 2.8% for the quarter. Same-store sales started out strong in May with June being weaker and sales strengthening in July. It is my belief that this was reflective of the weak overall U.S. retail sales report for June and mirrors what you have heard from some other retailers.  Sales per square foot reached a record $225. For the 30th consecutive quarter-over-quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket. Gross margin expanded by 36 basis points to 31.2%, which follows our strong first quarter margin performance. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $0.95. During the quarter, we returned $265 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.6 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend.  Given our performance for the first half of the year, we are reconfirming our full year financial outlook. Our current expectation is that same-store sales will likely be closer to the lower end of our range of 3% to 3.5% growth. EPS remains in the range of $3.85 to $3.95.  We continue to grow transaction and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. We experienced consistent mid-single-digit share growth in both units and dollars for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods.  With that, let me now turn to an update on our key initiatives. As we shared with you last quarter, we are making targeted labor investments to grow market share in a competitive environment while providing for positive financial returns. The labor hour investment in this select group of stores is designed to ensure we deliver on our customers' expectation in more competitive markets to enhance our in-stock position for a more convenient shopping experience. Our goal is to further reduce the truck to shelf time for merchandise in these stores, providing our consumer with the right product, at the right time, at the right price.  For each phase, the store operations team has a specific metric and timetable for determining the financial return criteria for achieving results, based on a similar 2014 test and learn program. Currently, we have completed the first of 3 phases of the labor investments. Our Phase 1 stores received the incremental labor hours during the second quarter. I am pleased to report that our Phase 1 stores are delivering on our return expectations. Specifically, the key metrics of same-store sales, transactions, average basket and consumer satisfaction scores are all showing significant improvement. I believe these strong results are driven by a notably better in-stock position post the incremental store investments. With these solid results, we plan to accelerate our implementation of Phases 2 and 3 in stores in the second half of the year.  The second investment in labor comes from the realignment of our store operations management structure to optimize the scale of our divisions, regions and districts to improve accountability and maximizing training and teamwork, all while driving stronger, more sustainable results. We have reduced the time our district managers spend driving so they can invest more time mentoring and coaching our store managers on developing and strengthening their teams. These changes have been in place since February. We expected that, over time, this would help both our consumer satisfaction and store manager turnover. We are pleased to see signs that this initiative is paying off. Our customer satisfaction scores are improving, and we are approaching our fourth consecutive month of declining store manager turnover rates. Further, we are moving forward with a number of inventory management initiatives. For example, our sky-shelf program will be completely rolled out across the chain by the end of the third quarter to allow for placement of inventory directly above the respective categories. This allows our teams to get product out of the back rooms to facilitate improved stocking and ultimately, drive labor efficiencies. Already, we are seeing encouraging results with our receiving room inventory down by about 20% based on the most recent store inventories.  During the third quarter, we anticipate concluding our multiyear rollout of our enterprise resource planning software for our supply chain. Our new supply chain solution provided by our vendors, Symphony EYC, is replacing our legacy system, which has limited capabilities to support our growth. This technology platform represents a significant improvement with enhanced integration to allow for demand forecasting from vendor to shelf. Going forward, our new system is scalable to support our growth and configurable to support changes in our business. Over time, we believe this project will benefit our inventory levels at the DCs and in the stores and our allocation of merchandise on a store-by-store basis.  Our overall in-stock position on the shelf should improve as well. This is a significant investment that will allow us to better service our stores and provide much better visibility into our business.  On a combined basis, we believe these labor investments and inventory management initiatives are significant steps to improving our in-stock position, which is a critical component of our overall customer satisfaction and a driver of sales performance.  On the merchandising front, we had positive same-store sales growth across all categories in the second quarter. Growth was generally balanced across consumables and non-consumables. This represents the sixth consecutive quarter for improvement in our non-consumable categories. Strength in consumables was driven by candy and snacks, tobacco and perishables. In addition, we had broad-based strength across seasonal and home. Our ladies and accessory departments within the apparel group continued to exhibit strong performance, comping above the company average.  Affordability continues to play a key role as we expand SKUs across the store at the sweet spot of $1 to $5. For the second quarter, nearly 50% of our consumers' baskets contained at least one item priced at $1, and these baskets grew faster than our overall transactions. Shrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reducing our shrink at store level. For the quarter, we are extremely pleased with our shrink improvement. This progress was broad-based with shrink declining in 70% of the product departments and approximately 70% of our regions improving year-over-year based on store inventories performed so far this year. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to reduce shrink. Turning to the second half of the year, including the holiday season. We are capitalizing on our consumer insights to strengthen our merchandising offering across product categories. In turn, this will be supported by a robust print and digital marketing calendar. We continue to capitalize on new ways to wow our consumers. We are focused on expanding high-opportunity categories and giving our consumer the trend-right products she wants at affordable prices. For instance, we know licensed products resonate with our consumers as they are on trend and communicate value. As a result, we are broadening our reach across categories with more impactful licensed products. At the same time, affordability is as important as ever to our consumers. For 2015, more than 40% of our holiday seasonal assortment is priced at $1.  From a real estate perspective, we remain disciplined and focused on financial returns. We continue to see our new store productivity at around 85% of our comp base, all while driving strong returns. We remain very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2015 and our pipeline is full.  The Dollar General stores in our 3 new states of Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon, continue to ramp up nicely. We have reduced the capital investment required for remodels, while also driving strong sales lifts of 4% to 5% and an improved return on investment in excess of 200 basis points.  In total, the team has already executed more than 1,000 projects across new store openings, remodels and relocations. This represents around 8 projects a day. The real estate team has continued to build upon its progress for the 2016 pipeline. The planned growth in selling square feet of about 7% translates to approximately 900 new store openings. Our development pipeline is over 80% complete for planned 2016 store openings, and we expect to be 100% complete by the fourth quarter. Our strong track record of delivering exceptional returns in our new store program gives us confidence in our model going forward. Now let me turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results and our outlook.  We are pleased with our second quarter results given our strong gross margin expansion and our SG&A performance. Gross profit for the second quarter was $1.6 billion or 31.2% of sales, an increase of 36 basis points from last year's second quarter. As compared to the prior year, the most significant drivers were higher initial inventory markups, improved inventory shrink rate and lower transportation costs. Partially offsetting these improvements to gross profit were increased markdowns.  SG&A expense increased by 9 basis points over the 2014 period to $1.1 billion or 21.8% of sales in the second quarter. Using disciplined cost management, we were successful in mitigating our SG&A deleverage. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to higher store asset impairments, incentive compensation, repairs and maintenance and fees associated with the increased use of debit cards. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38%.  Moving now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3 billion, up 2.7% on a per-store basis. Year-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $557 million, an increase of $70 million or 14% compared to the same period last year. Total capital expenditures were $247 million. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our common stock for $200 million. We also paid a dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding, totaling $65 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased over $3 billion of our common stock. We currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $489 million. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our growth. We aim to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.  Turning now to guidance. We are reconfirming our financial guidance ranges for 2015. Details of our guidance are included in our press release. Highlights include top line sales for the year are expected to increase 8% to 9%. Expectations for overall selling square footage growth remain at approximately 6%. And as you model out the third quarter and fourth quarter, please keep in mind that the day of Halloween falls into our fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to our third quarter of 2014. We anticipate this could have a modestly negative impact in the third quarter due to the year-over-year comparison. For the year, same-store sales are expected to increase 3% to 3.5%, with the expectation that it will be closer to the lower end of our range. Our expectation for diluted earnings per share remains $3.85 to $3.95 for the year.  As our long-term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers in a wide variety of economic conditions and in turn, deliver strong results for our shareholders over time.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. As I approach the conclusion of my first 100 days as CEO, I am as excited as ever about the opportunities ahead of us at Dollar General. I feel great about the team that we have in place, and I am confident that Jeff and Jim will play an important role in Dollar General's long-term success. The team is energized and excited as we look to help our consumers Save time. Save money. Every day! Looking ahead to 2016, the team is focused on driving profitable sales growth. We are deep into the planning process for this coming year. While it's still early, I would like to share with you some of our preliminary initiatives.  A new store prototype will be rolled out in 2016 for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The format will allow for a more customer-friendly shopping experience. And in this prototype, the consumer will be able to and have faster, more convenient checkout, an attribute that is a high priority for our core consumer. We have value engineered the design to be capital-efficient and easier to operate for our store teams. Given the early results from our tests, we are encouraged about the prototype.  We have a significant opportunity to increase our cooler penetration across our store bases, perishables, drive trips and basket size with our consumer as she looks for a quick meal solution or a fill-in item. Across the chain, a basket with a perishable item is nearly 50% higher than the chain average. This is a big opportunity that we know how to capitalize on as we have already increased the cooler count on average by just over 50% since 2008.  More and more our consumer is looking to DG for her health and beauty needs. Based on our customer insights, we will look to expand our offerings across segments, such as hair care, cough and cold and over-the-counter meds, skincare and nail care. We are well positioned to capitalize on this trend given our brand offerings and price relevancy.  Our ongoing affordability initiative will be front and center with the new refreshed approach. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.  All in, 2016 is shaping up to have meaningful initiatives to drive our performance. I look forward to sharing more details about our plans as we move forward.  Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our team is energized to seize growth opportunities. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in accelerated store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividends. My personal thanks and gratitude go out to all of the 112,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill on our mission of serving others by providing our consumers with convenience, value and service every day.  With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Okay. Brandy, we'll go ahead and take our first question, please. Operator : Your first question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So Todd, can you talk to some of the drivers of the top line reacceleration in July, maybe what you've seen in August? And then more importantly, larger picture, just what's the best way to think about the lower gas prices, the wage increases? Have you seen any impact, and just the best way to think about it? Todd Vasos : Yes, Matt, sure will. When we looked at our sales, it really did mirror I think what the nation saw at retail out there. What we saw was, once we got through the month of June and into July, the weather patterns normalized, the heat returned and those torrential rains in Texas and Oklahoma and other areas subsided, and we saw a return to a little bit of a normal pattern and where our consumable and non-consumable businesses both did very well as we moved into the weeks of July to the end of July. So that's what gives us confidence in our guidance for the full year in sales because we've seen that our sales are -- have rebounded from that dip in June. And to be honest with you, I think it's way too early to have seen, and we really haven't seen any indication that the consumer is spending anything more because she has additional wage money in her pocket. But again, our core consumer is a little different in that before she starts to spend, she really needs to have confidence and see a sustained ability that income will continue to come her way. So she's a little bit slower on pulling the trigger on spending a little bit more money. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow-up. As we think about gross margins, so 2 quarters of pretty healthy expansion here, beyond thinking about the tougher back half comparisons, what's the best way to think about gross margins on a multiyear basis? And any headwinds that would prevent continued expansion as we think beyond this year? John Garratt : Well, we do feel great about the margin expansion in the first half with 45 basis points of growth in Q1 and 36 basis points in Q2. And as we look at it, it's very broad-based as we've utilized many levers. We continue to reduce shrink and see opportunity for further improvement there. We continue to grow our non-consumables business, which helps our mix. We've had 6 consecutive quarters of growth with non-consumables. And we continue to effectively manage the other levers, including category management, private label and foreign sourcing. As we look to the back half of the year, we don't see this structurally changing. We do see it moderating somewhat, and do bear in mind that we also always reserve the right to invest in EDLP as needed to drive units and transactions. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : So Todd, when we saw -- been out visiting stores, visiting competitors, and one thing that we've seen is a lot of Family Dollar stores that are closing, as they're planning to transition to the Dollar Tree brand. I'm sure that you're giving attention to your stores that are adjacent to see how they perform after they make that change. Are there any insights that you can give us? Todd Vasos : Dan, I think it's way too early to really know exactly what's going on. I think it's fair to say with the transaction closing in July, it's in the infancy stages. But what we're squarely focused on is controlling what we can control. And we are always out there looking to capitalize on opportunities as we see them. But I am encouraged on the labor front where we have invested in labor in some of our stores where the product is getting on the shelf faster. And I can tell you that all of our consumer work in these stores are showing that the consumer is seeing the difference inside of our stores with our in-stock rates increasing. So we feel very, very confident that in any way that we can capitalize, we will as we go forward. Daniel Wewer : And then just as a follow-up. In your prepared comments and talking about Jeff and Jim coming back to the company, you used the phrase, getting the team back together. One of the questions we've been getting from a lot of investors, why did they leave to begin with a couple of years ago? And what has changed that lead them to resume their career at DG? Todd Vasos : Yes, while I can't exactly tell you why they left, because I'm sure they had their own reasons, I think the interesting thing is that they saw an opportunity, as I do, here at Dollar General and returned. And really, what I'm excited about is that return, because we have all worked together for many years prior to them leaving, and they know the play book, they know our customers, and they know how to move quickly and drive profitable sales growth. So we feel very confident that in the quarters and years to come, they'll be huge contributors with the rest of the executive management team. Operator : Your next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : Two related questions, I think, Smart & Simple. Where do we stand? And how much do you want to expand that, or expect to expand that over the next, I don't know, 1 year or 2 or 3? And then DG Market, now that you are in the top spot there, is it still -- do you kind of still look at that as an experimental lab? And are you learning a lot that helps you against Aldi and Save-A-Lot? Todd Vasos : Yes, those are great questions, John. On the Smart & Simple side, first. Affordability is still and will be and continue to be front and center here at Dollar General. And Smart & Simple plays a huge role in that. We've doubled the SKU count so far in 2015, and we see that pace continuing as we go into 2016. It really does give our consumer that price point that's magical in a lot of cases of $1. And even though some items are over $1 at Smart & Simple, it is a tremendous value. So we see that brand growing, and we see it as a price fighter to a lot of different disciplines out there across grocery and drug. So we feel very good about it. And again, remember, our consumer looks to us first for value and price. And that's what we deliver with that Smart & Simple brand. So we're very excited about it. As it relates to DG Markets. We continue to use DG Markets as a test lab. We continue to learn in those stores. But also, the great thing is, is a lot of the learnings from DG Market, we apply into our plus stores and our traditional stores. And quite frankly, some of the pieces that you'll see in our new store prototype in 2016 was generated from the market store concept and the plus concept. So we still see those -- we still see the market store as a real viable kind of a store for us because of a lot of things : One, driving top line sales giving the consumer a great value with expanded grocery and perishable; but also, because of that test bed that it provides the rest of the chain. So we feel good about it. John Heinbockel : And then as a follow-up to that. If you are going to add more Smart & Simple, do you cut SKUs and do you cut, maybe, branded SKUs? Or you just have less facings for what's out there? And then I assume, it would be nice to put traffic generating perishables in. But I assume you're not going to play around with produce because you can blow yourself up pretty good expanding that, is that fair? Todd Vasos : Yes, that is very fair to say. Right now, we don't have anything on the horizon as far as the perishable side. But you know what, we're always looking. Again, in our market stores, perishables play a pretty important role in those, and we're learning a lot about that fresh side of the business on perishables. But right now, no big plans to do anything there. As it relates to -- back to Smart & Simple, I think the best way to look at Smart & Simple for us is that what it really provides us is, and the consumer is, that it provides that affordability. And then for our consumer, it gives her trial. And then from the trial, she moves into acceptance of an item. And then she trades in or trades down, so I think it's an important piece. Now as we start to put more and more of these Smart & Simple items on the shelf, I think it's fair to say that something has to go. And the great thing about Dollar General is we're very disciplined in our category management approach. So I can tell you, John, that what we decide to eliminate to put in Smart & Simple will be the exact right decision for our customer at Dollar General. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : Could you just give us a perspective on the comp guidance range now it's at the low end, was it simply a result of a slow June? Or is there something that's maybe not up picking up here as we're getting into the back half of the year? Todd Vasos : John, I think you look at it, we're very pleased with how our second quarter ended up. We've delivered nearly 8% revenue growth and 14% EPS growth. So we feel very strong about it. And that's what gives us the opportunity, Peter, to work and look at the back half of the year and our full year guidance. And it gives us the confidence that we'll hit that range, that lower end of the range. Peter Keith : Okay. Maybe, attributing [ph] the question to John. Historically, the company talked about leveraging expenses at 3.5%. I was wondering, with some of the labor investments coming on the back half of the year and the pickup in the store growth next year, does that leverage point begin to move up for the next couple of quarters? John Garratt : Yes, you're correct. The SG&A leverage point has been and is around 3.5%. What you will see as you move into the back half as we do accelerate our targeted investment in labor, you will see some deleverage from that on the front end. This pays back, provides a great return in the longer term, but it does provide some deleverage to SG&A as it takes a couple of months, couple of quarters for it to pay back. Peter Keith : And maybe you're not comfortable talking about 2016, but just on that store growth dynamic, too, next year. Should we be thinking about that as well as another point of near-term deleverage? John Garratt : We'll be coming back to you later with 2016 guidance later in the year. But right now, we're comfortable with our guidance for this year and to model and see this labor investment as a near-term impact that will provide great returns, longer term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : I wanted to kind of go down the same path. I think I asked this last time and the last person was asking questions just about, as we think of '16 and expenses, I know you guys said you're deep into planning, but labor across your companies is becoming an issue as the labor markets tighten up. Then of course, we have the overtime rule changes being proposed by the government, look like they are going to come in. So I specifically want to understand a little bit about next year and labor expenses and how you guys are looking to maybe offset some of this pressure that seems out there. Todd Vasos : Well, Scott, it's still a little early with a few of the things that are out there. Obviously, as we said before, we will always in markets pay a competitive wage to attract the right people and retain the right people. So we have been doing that for years, and we will continue to do that in '16 and beyond. But it is pretty early on a few of the fronts, especially the non-exempt and overtime legislation that's out there, it's still in comment period. So we're waiting to see exactly how that affects us. But as you can imagine, only our store managers are exempt today within our store from a salary perspective. So while it will affect us, it will be -- also an effect on everyone else in the marketplace. But I think again, it's still a little early, but rest assured, we are watching it very carefully. Scott Mushkin : Do you actually think maybe, since you guys have done a lot of work, that it's an advantage to you just because it's just your store manager? Or should we not think of it that way that it's just going to affect everybody and you included, or do you think maybe it affects you guys a little bit less? Todd Vasos : Yes, I think, for right now, again because it's so early, I would think about it, it's going to affect everybody. But as this becomes clearer, as time passes, we'll have a better idea and get back to everyone on it. Scott Mushkin : Okay. And then, not to kind of keep coming back to the sales trend. I know you've talked about June was soft, July picked up, pretty much everyone we've been talking to about August is saying things are a little, I guess, queasiness about August, and where that's really going to come in, we're not done with it officially yet. But it does seem like we kind of just go up and down, up and down, and we really are running in place. I mean, is some of you cautiousness -- cautious about the back half, maybe sales are going to be a little harder to come by even though gas prices are down, or am I reading too much into that? Todd Vasos : Yes, I think the way to look at it, Scott, is that the calendar shift has caused a little angst probably out there with the consumer only from the standpoint that Labor Day has been pushed back a week, as you know. And most states with schools, they sort of key off of that Labor Day date. So in a lot of cases, what we've seen is that back-to-school has been pushed back in the calendar a little bit. Now the great thing here at Dollar General that we've seen is that where school is already started, our back-to-school comps are hitting and/or exceeding our expectations. So we feel very good about that. But we have contemplated where we think we are here in August, and where we'll be at the end of the third quarter, and we've embedded that in that guidance that we've given you. We feel pretty confident about that. Operator : Your next question comes from David Mann of Johnson Rice. David Mann : Question about the IMU strength that you've been seeing. Can you give a sense on your outlook for whether that would continue in the second half? And any expected benefits from the one devaluation that might help that into '16? John Garratt : Sure, sure. We don't see anything structurally changing in terms of the drivers from the first half in terms of them going into second half. In terms of the devaluation, there's no immediate impact. The payments to our international vendors are denominated in U.S. dollars to reduce volatility. Of course, we're monitoring the situation. And this could translate to opportunity for lower costs down the road. David Mann : And then as a follow-up. In terms of what your comment about the holiday value offering, the 40% comment that you made, what does that compare to, let's say, for last year's holiday offering? And will your overall holiday seasonal investment, how does that compare year-over-year? Todd Vasos : Yes, we're, David, pretty bullish on that back half of the year and holiday because of all the work that the team has done on category management. That 40%, I could tell you that it is an increase over last year. And again, that it was because of the success of holiday of 2015 where we saw our consumers gravitating to that affordability piece. So we've had a full year to make sure that we deliver on the strong affordability for holiday 2016, and we're pretty excited about the lineup that we have coming. Operator : Your next question comes from of Meredith Adler of Barclays. Meredith Adler : A question about real estate. I have one company now they're based in -- a neighborhood shopping center, but one company that's talked about lease costs going up. Obviously, your real estate is different, but maybe you could just talk a little bit about the real estate environment? And first, in terms of availability? And second, in terms of cost? John Garratt : Sure, great question. We feel great about real estate. We have a phenomenal team that does a great job finding great sites while holding down cost. We have not seen a change and we've not seen a change to our great returns, we're still averaging about 20% returns on our newbuilds, and less than 2-year payback. So no change to that, and we feel great about the pipeline going forward. It's a very robust pipeline. We're going to open 730 new units this year. And we are targeting about 900 new units next year. And we continue to see these new units perform at about 85% the comp base. And we continued to see them, as I said, deliver great returns. So we feel very bullish about our returns going forward. Meredith Adler : And based on those comments, it sounds like there isn't anything in the environment that would make you want to accelerate the pace of growth in markets that are most expensive. I don't actually know how many stores you have in California now, but either like California or the Northeast, is there anything that says, \"Gee, we've got a window of opportunity now that might not last?\" Todd Vasos : Meredith, this is Todd. When we look at it, we are definitely looking at all opportunities that are out there. But as you know us very well, we always take a very measured approach on how we accelerate growth and where we accelerate it. And rest assured, because of that discipline we have in our real estate model, that one, we're looking for every opportunity, but also on the second side of that, we're making sure that we do it very measured. So as we go out, that we continue to outperform our expectations when we open these stores. Operator : Your next question comes from Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse. Edward Kelly : So Todd, a question for you on the competitive environment, can you maybe just talk a little bit in terms of what you're seeing there? And I did you hear you guys say something to the effect of you reserve the right to invest in EDLP in the back half if necessary? Or are you seeing anything out there that leads you to believe that you may need to do something like that? Todd Vasos : Ed, I have to say that the environment is still very rational. And when we look out, we don't see anything that structurally -- where that changes. But as you know, any time that we see necessary to drive units, we will invest in price to make sure that we protect and grow our market share. So while we don't see anything that's immediate, we are always looking at opportunities to deliver further value to our consumers. Edward Kelly : Okay. And then just one follow-up to something you mentioned on the call, you talked a lot about improving in-stocks. Could you maybe just provide more color on sort of, I guess, historically, what you think the issue may have been if there was even an issue? And what you think you were leaving on the table from a sales perspective to give us some sense as to what we should be looking for in terms of the benefit going forward? Todd Vasos : Yes. The fun thing about retail is that there's always opportunity to get better out there. And in-stock is one of those for us that we can get better. We've done a good job over the years on in-stock, but there's always room to improve. And we think that improving in-stock, and we've proven it with these labor investments that we've done here in the second quarter, that the consumer reacts very quickly to those in-stock pieces and she sees the product she wants on the shelf, and we deliver a great price every day, we just got to make sure when she comes in that it's there for her and she can pick it up. So I think between the labor investments that we've made and the ones upcoming as well as our supply chain solution that I talked about, as that now starts to really get fully integrated into the system, it should as well help our in-stock position. So we've got, in my mind, nowhere but up to go on in-stocks. Operator : Next question is from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : I was hoping you could first clarify a little bit on the back half margin guidance. The reiterated range is embedding a declining EBIT margin. Can you just walk through a little bit more the puts and takes between both gross margin and SG&A, and then I have a little bit of longer-term follow-up, if I can? John Garratt : Sure. As we look at the back half, as I mentioned previously, we do expect to continue to grow or expand our margins in the back half. But given the tougher laps we do expect that to moderate somewhat. On the SG&A front, as we've mentioned, we're investing in labor, and that's ramping up. And while that does provide great returns in the long term, it does deleverage in the near term. So that would put some deleveraged pressure on SG&A in the back half on the front-end of that investment. Stephen Grambling : And then as you think about the health of the consumer, I know you've been able to segment the base into a couple of different types. I'm wondering what are you seeing in terms of either spending from the trade-down consumer or the value-focused consumer. Is there any different trends that you're seeing there that you can call out? Todd Vasos : Yes, Stephen, we still continue to see the trade-down consumer gravitating toward Dollar General, which is great to see. Our core consumer, which obviously makes up a big piece of our overall sales and profitability here at Dollar General, while she feels a little bit better, it appears, financially, what she tells us, and we knew this going in, is that, it takes her a little longer to start spending because she has to feel confident that what she's seeing is sustainable in her budget. And so it takes a little bit more time for her to let go of the purse strings a little bit more, but the great thing about Dollar General is, is that through our category management work and through our field operators that we have out there, our store managers and their staff, we can deliver a great product to her when she's ready to spend. And I think we've proven that over the years. Operator : Your next question comes from Taylor LaBarr of Stifel. Taylor LaBarr : Just wondering if you could discuss the apparel category a little bit. That's obviously been a big driver of the shift in non-consumables over the last couple of quarters. That is going to be against a tougher compare for the next year. Just wondering if this kind of mid-single-digit growth rate is the range we should expect, and if that's part of the more conservative gross margin guidance for the back half. Todd Vasos : Yes, Taylor, we're very proud of what the team has accomplished in apparel and in non-consumables in general. But also, our consumable business. We are -- when we look out in the guidance that we provided, we feel good about both sides of those businesses. As it relates to apparel, it is a key driver of profitability for us. And we see that even through the back half of the year going into 2016, our teams have got great products lined up, great values for our consumer. So that we really see that year-over-year, we're going to see and continue to see increases in our apparel businesses. Taylor LaBarr : Okay, great. And then one follow-up actually on the private label brands' repackaging. Is that pretty much complete? I know you were doing that throughout this summer. And then have you seen a mix shift towards those private label brands? I don't know if you can tease out any impact from the repackaging versus a focus on affordability more broadly, but just any comments there? Todd Vasos : Yes, private brands are really important to Dollar General, very important. So we watch it very carefully. We're essentially complete on our rebranding, the repackaging pieces of it. But as you expect from Dollar General, we're always trying to improve everything we do. So we're now going back to certain SKUs that may not have performed like we thought and are now tweaking those. So we're in Phase 2, I would call it, of the packaging. And right now, we're pretty happy with what we see. And again, private brands, Smart & Simple and the Rexall brands for us are extremely important as we go into 2016. So lot of emphasis being placed there, and we'll continue to see that grow for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Lasser : How do you feel about the overall store standards, and how they've tracked over the last 4 quarters? These labor investments, these inventory investments would suggest that you've seen something in the business that perhaps has been slipping and you need to address them, perhaps that's an opportunity for some sales improvement, especially as you've seen the Phase 1 performance? Todd Vasos : Yes, when you look out across our store base and the beauty of Dollar General is we've got over 12,000 stores and working our way to 13,000 stores. And as you could imagine, we've got, in some areas, we've got better standards than others, and we're always working to make sure that we better our standards. And the great thing with the labor investments that you've mentioned is that we've seen betterment, if you will, on both top line sales as well as store manager turnover rates going down, not only in those stores but across the chain. So we're doing something right here. And we think we're onto something. And when you look at it, that's one reason we want to accelerate these labor investments as we get into Q3 and 4. As we go into the back half of the year, we think that there is a big opportunity for us. And to be honest with you, by the end of Q4, we should be approaching about 1/3 of the chain with these new labor investments and additional hours in there. So we feel very good about going into fourth quarter and taking that into 2016 with us. Michael Lasser : And on the labor investments, you mentioned seeing a lift in sales transactions, a reduction in turnover, but you didn't mention profitability. So are you finding that you're getting a suitable return for these investments from a profitability perspective? Todd Vasos : Yes, when you look at it, here at Dollar General, the great thing about the disciplines that we've put in place over the years, we do nothing here that doesn't have a return. I can guarantee you this has return metrics in place, and they are delivering on those returns. Now, is every store delivering? Perhaps not, but that's the beauty of us. We look at it by store, and we either get those stores to produce or it we'll roll those off the labor investments, and reinvest those somewhere else. So we're squarely focused on making sure it returns. Michael Lasser : Okay. And one last quick question. As the environment does get better and your consumers release their purse strings a little bit. How do you feel about Dollar General's ability to capture that incremental spend? What's the possibility that, that customer is going to spend maybe in the mass merchant channel as the gas prices, fuel is cheaper, maybe make it cheaper to drive a slightly longer distance? Todd Vasos : The -- when you look at the beauty of Dollar General and the value that we create for the shopper as well as the convenience that we have, you couple that with probably the strongest category management disciplines that you can see out there. And then with our store managers and their store teams squarely focused, we feel that we're in a great position, if not some of the best positions out there, to capitalize when she starts to spend. And on top of that, we're always looking at other ways past the consumer to capitalize. And anything that we see, we'll make sure that we get our fair share here at Dollar General. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Binder of Jefferies. Daniel Binder : Talked a little bit about the in-stock opportunity. I'm curious if you could comment a little bit about where you've been, what the goals are, and what you think that translates to in terms of a comp benefit if you achieve those goals? Todd Vasos : Yes, again, Dan, when you look at it, we've got opportunities just like everyone out there. And our opportunities, the nice thing about Dollar General, because of the disciplines we have, those opportunities that present themselves, we feel very confident. And as we put programs in place, as we've done now with in-stock, we feel that we can capitalize quickly on it. While I don't want to give you the exact metric around it, rest assured that the focus, the attention and any capital that we're throwing at this will have a return. And we'll definitely make sure that it returns to the consumer. And that's really what this is all about, is making sure that our consumer is satisfied when she leaves our store every time. Daniel Binder : I apologize if I missed this, but did -- are you able to quantify the Halloween shift between Q3 and 4? Todd Vasos : Yes, for us, we haven't really quantified it, but we know internally, obviously, what we expect on that Halloween Day. And because of our convenient nature as a retailer, the holiday is always late, right? So it's always those last 2 days, so the day before or the day of the event. So it's a significant piece of our business the day of the event. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Nemer : I wanted to follow up on an earlier question on the apparel category. Your sales growth slowed from about 10% last quarter, I think it was around 11% in the fourth quarter down to 5%. Is there anything in particular going on there? Is it mostly a comparison issue? Todd Vasos : Yes, it is a little bit of a comparison issue. When you look at it, it was seasonally driven. And when we saw the return of the warm weather in the July month and now into August, we saw things normalize. We feel very good about where we are on a sell-through percentage rate, it is right on target. So we don't think there's anything structural there. It was just a little bit of a blip. Matt Nemer : Okay. And then secondly, you mentioned the impact of markdowns to gross margin. And I think that was a fairly sizable headwind in the second quarter of last year. So I think, you had an easy comp on that front. Can you just square that with your comments that the competitive environment has been rational? John Garratt : The markdowns were promotional driven and really ordinary course, nothing unusual with those during this quarter. Todd Vasos : Yes. And as you look at it, as far as the competition is concerned, we, again, really want to deliver value to our consumer. So where we think we need to invest in price, we do. And in some cases, it may come in the form of promotional. But the majority of our reinvestment in the price comes at an everyday low price value on the shelf. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Wanted to ask about shrink. You guys mentioned it a few times throughout the call this morning. Sounds like you've been making or are continuing to make some nice improvements on that. But can you give us a little bit more color around maybe some of the specific initiatives and some of the categories that you are doing it? It sounds like it's still is an opportunity going forward. Maybe even maybe with some of the things that you're doing on the labor investment front, that would be helpful. Todd Vasos : Yes, shrink continues to be one of our biggest gross margin levers that we have. And the team has been squarely focused over the past 12 to 18 months on reducing shrink. And I can tell you that, that between the use of our tools that we have available to us, which I think are world-class, our defensive merchandising, and just the complete refocus at retail on shrink has given us the benefit that we're seeing. We don't see that slowing down. Matter of fact, we are putting more ammunition and tools and abilities for our stores, our district managers to reduce shrink, and we'll continue to do that as we move through the rest of the year and into next. The good thing about shrink, and the bad thing, quite frankly, but the good thing for us is shrink has a tail to it and anything that we work on now pays dividends down the road and into next year. So we feel good about where shrink is headed, and we'll continue to work it hard because it is a big, big opportunity for us. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the prototypes for the 2016 class of stores. Should we expect either just visually looking at the store or in terms of the level of investment that's going to be needed on a per-store basis with improving checkout, coolers, et cetera. Can you give us any further clarity around that at this point? Todd Vasos : Yes. We're going to come back to you with a little bit more detail. But just to a tad bit of color, the store will visibly look different to the consumer. They will definitely see a difference as they walk in the store. The checkout area is a big, big difference and a departure from where we've been, but really is consumer-centric. And I could tell you that all of the work that we've done around this and as you can imagine here at Dollar General, we don't do anything without bringing our consumers along with us. She loves that new front end, that new prototype. And the investments will come in areas like cooler expansion in other areas. But rest assured that our team has looked at ways to pull cost, though, out of the build as well as the investments inside the box to help offset that. So we feel very confident in maintaining the returns that we currently see today as we go into our 2016 pipeline. Mary Winn Pilkington : Operator, I know we're at the top of the hour, so we'll go ahead and cut it off here. We may have left a few people in the queue, but Matt and I are around all day, so please give us a call. And thank you for joining the call today. That will conclude our call. John Garratt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, December 3, 2015. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and John Garratt, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.

Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which, as I had mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com in the Investor Information, Press Releases section. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. This morning, we announced our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015, along with an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization.  Returning cash to shareholders remains a top priority, and we expect to deliver nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders during 2015 through both anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends.  Additionally, I'm very pleased to announce John Garratt has been promoted to CFO. I have gotten to know John very well over the last 15 months, and he is an accomplished executive with significant financial experience. As interim CFO, John has already played a key role as we look to implement our zero-based budgeting process and execute our new store growth. I look forward to his further and future contributions at Dollar General.  Turning now to the quarter. Our initiatives are showing success relative to our long-term goals as we continue to drive profitable sales growth. We have the right team in place to capture high-return, low-risk organic growth opportunities. We are aggressively taking steps to position Dollar General to be successful regardless of the retail sales environment.  I am pleased with the way the team managed the business given the continued overall weaker retail environment across the sector. For us, our core consumer is still struggling as she continues to face rising costs in major expenditure categories, like rent and health care, with no real income growth. We believe that our core consumer is closely monitoring her spending not just with us, but across all retail. Turning to some of the highlights for the quarter and year-to-date to the third quarter. Third quarter sales increased 7.3% to $5.1 billion. Year-to-date, total sales were $15.1 billion, an increase of 8%. We delivered same-store sales growth of 2.3% for the quarter. Adjusting for the Halloween shift to Q4, same-store sales were fairly consistent across all periods of the quarter. We estimate this Halloween shift was a 20 to 30 basis point negative impact on same-store sales in the third quarter. Same-store sales increased 2.9% year-to-date through the third quarter. Sales per square foot were $225.  For the 31st consecutive quarter when compared to the prior year quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket. Gross margin expanded by 19 basis points to 30.3% in the third quarter. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.86. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.88. During the quarter, we returned $340 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 3.8 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend.  Given our performance year-to-date, we are updating our full year financial outlook. We expect same-store sales will likely be in the range of 2.5% to 2.8% for fiscal 2015. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 is expected to be in the range of $3.87 to $3.92, and adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.88 to $3.93.  We continue to grow transactions and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. We experienced consistent mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollars for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods.  Let's turn now to a more detailed review of our growth drivers. Our real estate program is the foundation for our growth with a proven high-return, low-risk model. We remained disciplined and focused on financial returns. We continue to see our new store productivity at around 85% of our comp base, all while driving strong returns of approximately 20%.  For 2015, we are on track to open 730 new stores and relocate or remodel a combined 875 stores. The average sales performance of our new stores is running ahead of our forecast.  Looking ahead for 2016, our pipeline is full as we continue to plan for approximately 7% square footage growth or about 900 new store openings. The real estate team has continued to build upon this progress with the 2017 pipeline, which is starting out at a greater pace than our 2016 pipeline, as we look to continue to capitalize on the strength of our real estate model. With our real estate strategy firmly in place, we continue to support our new store growth through the build-out of our distribution network. Our location in San Antonio, Texas is anticipated to begin receiving products this month and shipping in February of 2016.  We just broke ground in November for our 14th distribution center located in Janesville, Wisconsin. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network to support our growing store base. In-store, our targeted labor investments to grow market share in a competitive environment are providing positive financial returns. Currently, we've completed 2 of the 3 phases of the labor investment rollout across approximately 2,400 stores.  Recall that phase 1 rolled out in the second quarter, phase 2 was implemented in the third quarter, and phase 3 is scheduled to roll out during the fourth quarter. We continue to see same-store sales growth for our phase 1 stores gain traction since the second quarter roll out.  Phase 1 stores are the only stores that have been on the program long enough to really see an impact. Phase 1 stores are on track to deliver on our return expectations. Specifically, in these stores, the key metrics of same-store sales, transactions, average basket and customer satisfaction scores, are all showing significant improvement.  Additionally, across the chain, our store teams are focused on improving our on-shelf availability. The teams are leveraging retail basics, such as stocking and inventory management, to make progress. We are validating our on-shelf availability through the use of third-party audits. Since our recommitment to the on-shelf availability, our teams are making great improvement in a very short time as evidenced by our customer satisfaction scores. Our customer is recognizing our better in-stock position not only in the stores receiving the incremental labor investment, but across the chain as our scores are at the highest level in over a year.  And finally, as an indicator that these actions are resonating, we are seeing the best performance in 3 years for improving store manager turnover rates.  During the third quarter, we accomplished a major milestone related to the multiyear rollout of our enterprise resource planning software for our supply chain. This technology platform represents a significant improvement with enhanced integration to allow for demand forecasting from the vendor to shelf. The team executed this initiative without disruption to the business.  On a combined basis, we believe these labor investments and inventory management initiatives are significant steps to improving our in-stock position, which is a critical component of our overall customer satisfaction and a driver of sales performance.  On the merchandising front, we had a positive same-store sales growth across all categories in the third quarter, with higher growth in consumables than in non-consumable categories. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter for improved -- improvement in our non-consumable categories.  Strength in consumables was driven by growth in candy and snacks, tobacco and perishables. Within the non-consumable categories, sundries, housewares, hardware and ladies clothing all exhibited strong growth. Consistent with our recent trends, our consumer continued to shop the holiday close to the event. Our sell-through of Halloween and harvest merchandise was robust with a 90 basis point improvement year-over-year when taking into account the calendar shift into the fourth quarter this year.  Shrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reduce our shrink on a store-by-store basis. For the quarter, we are extremely pleased with our shrink improvement. This progress continues to be broad-based year-to-date, with shrink declining across nearly 70% of our product departments. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to further reduce shrink.  Turning to the holiday season. We have offers online and in store for savings on electronics, game items, toys, gift options, small kitchen appliances, food and much more. We had exciting specials in the week leading into Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday weekend that further allowed our customers to -- the opportunity to stretch their budget and save even more. Our toy business is off to a strong start. We are currently offering consumers an immediate 25% discount off of all qualifying toy purchases of $75 or more, both online and in stores. This year, about 70% of our toy offerings are branded or licensed products, which resonate with our customers as being on trend and communicating value.  We are capitalizing on our consumer insights to strengthen our merchandising offering across product categories. In turn, this will be supported by a robust print and digital marketing calendar. We continue to capitalize on new ways to wow our consumers. We are focused on expanding high-opportunity categories and giving our customers the trend-right products she wants at affordable prices.  Now let me turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. It is an honor and a privilege to be the new CFO of Dollar General. I am excited to have the chance to work with such a great team. To be named CFO is a tremendous opportunity as we continue to work together to invest for growth and to continue to create shareholder value over time. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our third quarter, I'll share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook. In the third quarter, we took important actions to continue driving the types of returns we expect from our business over time. Gross profit for the third quarter was $1.5 billion or 30.3% of sales, an increase of 19 basis points from last year's third quarter. As compared to the prior year, the most significant drivers were an improved inventory shrink rate and lower transportation cost, partially offset by sales mix.  SG&A expense in the quarter increased by 18 basis points over the comparable 2014 period to $1.1 billion or 22% of sales. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to our restructuring charge for onetime severance-related benefits of $6.1 million or 12 basis points.  The 2015 third quarter also reflects increases in store incentive compensation expenses, repairs and maintenance, occupancy costs and advertising expenses. Partially offsetting these items were lower utilities costs and a reduction in employee benefit costs.  The 2014 quarter reflects expenses of $8.2 million related to an attempted acquisition that was not completed, partially offset by unrelated insurance proceeds of $3.4 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37%.  Moving now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.1 billion, up 5.1% on a per-store basis. Key factors impacting this increase were our on-shelf availability initiative and the timing of receipts, coupled with our sales performance. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Going forward, our goal remains to ensure inventory growth is in line with our total sales growth over time.  Year-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $781 million, $60 million lower as compared to the same period last year. Changes in merchandise inventories and accounts payable were the key drivers of the reduction in cash flows. This was offset in part by increased net income of approximately $80 million. Total capital expenditures were $387 million.  During the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares of our common stock for $275 million. We also paid a dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding totaling $64 million.  Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December of 2011, we have repurchased over $3.3 billion of our common stock. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization of $1 billion, we currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $1.2 billion under the repurchase program.  We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our growth. Our goal is to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating and managing to a leverage ratio approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA.  During the quarter, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes, the proceeds of which were used to reduce a portion of the term loan. We also increased our revolver size and extended the maturity of our credit facility.  Also, during the quarter, we are pleased to note that S&P upgraded our credit ratings to BBB from BBB-, and Moody's upgraded our outlook to positive from stable.  Turning now to guidance. We are updating our financial guidance ranges for 2015. Details of our guidance are included in our press release. Highlights include : Total sales for the year are expected to increase approximately 8%; expectations for overall selling square footage growth remain at approximately 6%; and for the year, same-store sales are expected to increase by about 2.5% to 2.8%.  Please note that it is still very early in the quarter for us and our customer tends to shop closer to events. We have narrowed our expectations for the adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $3.88 to $3.93 for the year. This guidance assumes the reinstatement of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit back to the beginning of the year, which has always been included in our full year guidance. The impact of the tax credit is approximately $0.05 per share. There can be no assurance that this tax credit will be retroactively reinstated or reinstated at all in the fourth quarter.  We are deep in the budgeting process for 2016. The team is focused on sales initiatives to drive the top line, coupled with a zero-based budgeting mindset to reduce cost and SG&A. We are committed to getting our leverage point below our recent historical level of approximately 3.5% for same-store sales growth. I believe our budget actions should help us deliver strong results for our shareholders over time. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. As I look to the future for Dollar General, I have a clear vision on where we want to be and how to get there. We have brought together a great team over the course of the last 6 months. Since being named CEO in June, I have had the opportunity to visit with Dollar General employees at many levels in the organization, travel across the United States visiting stores and listening to our consumers. The culture of serving others is meaningful to the employees of Dollar General, and it is important to our consumers. We see a real opportunity to continue to save our consumers time and money every day.  Looking ahead to 2016, the team is focused on 4 key priorities to improve our overall results for the long term : first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, leveraging our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.  As I mentioned earlier, we are taking positive steps to position Dollar General for continued success with these 4 priorities as our guide and our consumer at the center of everything we do. On the consumer front, we are revisiting our brand archetype to ensure we are connecting with our consumers and differentiating our brand. This would help us better define how we communicate with our consumers and impact all customer-facing communications, including circulars, in-store branding and digital advertising. At the same time, we are updating our consumer segmentation as the foundation for strategies to drive product mix and assortment, marketing and even real estate.  We have completed our initial strategic planning process for 2016, and the teams continue to refine our initiatives. First, our actions to drive profitable sales begins and ends with our disciplined approach to category management. This allows -- this also, excuse me, includes expansion of categories that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores, including increased penetration in our legacy stores. Our ongoing affordability initiative will be front and center with the refreshed approach. We will also leverage operational initiatives such as improving our on-shelf availability.  Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Examples include our accelerated square footage growth in 2016, with the new store prototype that we will -- we plan to roll out to all new stores, relocations and remodels. The format will allow for high-growth, traffic-building categories to be expanded all in more customer-friendly layout with faster checkout. A new category optimization tool will also be deployed and will also make sure that it has optimized our assortments as we go forward into 2016.  Third, we will leverage our -- and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. We recently undertook a broad-based initiative to proactively improve our efficiencies and reduce expenses over a multiyear time frame, all while giving us the flexibility to reinvest savings to drive growth. We eliminated approximately 255 positions across our corporate support functions to improve our flexibility while positioning us to better serve our consumers.  Our zero-based budgeting approach is a refreshed commitment to removing cost from our business. We are targeting cost savings in specific budget categories. All these actions are filtered through 3 lenses : first, is it customer-facing; two, does it align with our strategic priorities; and finally, third, how does it impact our risk profile. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator. Fourth is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store management development through great onboarding and training and open communication. Continued improvement in store management turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover.  I look forward to sharing more details about our plans at an Investor Day scheduled for March 23 and 24 here in Nashville. Our goal is to allow plenty of time for interaction with our management team and share insights to our growth drivers for the long term. At Dollar General, we are moving fast and investing in the future. We continue to believe that our future is very bright. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our team is energized to seize growth opportunities. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in accelerated store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and anticipated dividends. As we are in the midst of the busiest season of retail, I'd like to extend my appreciation and thanks to the nearly 114,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our consumers with the convenience, value and service every day.  With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Great. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Congrats, John. So Todd, between your discussion of zero-based budgeting, being the low-cost operator, capturing profitable growth, what do you think the right comp rate is in order to generate leverage in the business if it's not 3.5%? And how do you get there in a world where consumables are growing faster than discretionary and putting pressure on your gross margin and you've based the potential of wage pressure over the long term? Todd Vasos : Yes. Michael, the way we see the business is, first of all, we have a very robust category management process here. And that process that we implemented well over 7 years ago has served us very well in being able to balance that consumable and non-consumable mix. While consumables continue to dominate our sales, I have to say that I'm very proud of where our non-consumable business has come. We never lost sight of our non-consumable businesses even through some of the real harsh times our consumer was going through back in 2009, '10 and coming out of that Great Recession that we had, and that continues now. We've had a nice string of consecutive quarters that our non-consumable businesses had been pretty strong. And then as you look at being that low-cost operator, we are committed to that. And I have to say, a little bit more to come as we get into 2016 on that. But I can tell you that it is our goal to ensure that, that leverage ratio comes down off of that 3.5%, and we'll be able to leverage our expenses at a much lower rate than it currently is. Michael Lasser : Okay. And my follow-up question is really in 2 parts. First, on the margin outlook for the fourth quarter, if -- to get to the midpoint of the range, it looks like you're going to have to assume 50 basis points or so of margin degradation. Is that right? And where is that coming from? And then could you clarify what you mean by consumers are shopping closer to events? Does that mean that it could start off a little volatile and you're still expecting trends to pick up as we get closer to Christmas? Todd Vasos : Yes, sure, Mike. Well, let me answer the -- your second question first, and I'll pass it over to John to talk to gross margin with you. As we see it, our core consumer, because she is always very cash-strapped, she does shop closer to the event. So whether it'd be 4th of July during the summer, whether it'd be Halloween in the fall or even holiday time around Christmas, she tends to shop heavier in the days leading into those holidays. Now she's always been that way, but we've seen it get a little bit closer to the holiday each and every year now for the last few years. And when you really look at our sales cadence in Q3, it was very evenly paced over the period. When you take that day shift that we have of Halloween into Q4 into account, it was very consistent. So it's just the way the consumer is shopping. And it's up to us as retailers to ensure that we supply her with what she needs at the time she needs it. And that's how we look at the business. John Garratt : In terms of your question around margin, I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the quarter-to-date performance driving 33 basis points of expansion. It has been very broad-based utilizing many levers such as shrink, expense control around distribution, transportation. And we see opportunity to continue driving the favorability on those over the long term as well as leveraging the additional levers we mentioned earlier in category management, private label and foreign sourcing. We had mentioned previously that the rate of expansion would moderate as we go forward. Looking ahead to Q4, our guidance for Q4 is 8% operating profit growth, and we look at -- for the full year, I'm sorry, 8% for the full year. And we look to utilize all the levers within SG&A and operating and gross margin to get there. I should note that, that is the toughest lap of the year, Q4. And I should also note that we lap the anniversary of our cash back fee, which had been providing benefits year-to-date as well as the ramp-up of labor investment, which does put some pressure on that. But still very comfortable with the 8% full year operating profit growth guidance and our ability to continue to drive operating profit margin growth over time. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Daniel Binder : A couple of questions. First, on the labor investments to get in-stocks up, you noted that you were seeing some benefits from the phase 1 stores. I was wondering if you could quantify a little bit more what that looked like. And just as a follow-on to that, I'm just curious if you're getting in-stocks up, I would think fairly quickly, once you add the labor in, why does it take a quarter or 2 to actually see it flow through to sales? Todd Vasos : Yes, Dan, how we see it is, first, the labor investments are paying off, and I have to give a lot of credit to our operators. They've done a very, very nice job in ensuring that the labor investments that we're making are very strategic in nature and they have a return. And in saying that, what we have seen, especially from the ones that we rolled in Q2, so the first initial wave, we're seeing increased sales at the rate -- actually, at an accelerated rate than we had first anticipated. And we're seeing great customer connection type scores, and again, how we measure our customer and how she looks at the business. So right now, we're very happy with that. And it does take a little time, though. As we roll this in, it takes some weeks for the customer to recognize that there's something different. Remember, our core consumer shops with us only, on average, about every 5 to 6 weeks. So it takes some time for her to come in and really notice the difference. But after a couple times coming in, she starts to see it. And as she sees that difference, we're seeing it on the sales line, and we're seeing it in her satisfaction scores. Daniel Binder : That's helpful. My other question was with regard to the tax rate. Last year, in the fourth quarter, I think you had a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate for a similar reason. So this year, is it an incremental $0.05 over last year? Or is it just, on an absolute basis, a $0.05 benefit? John Garratt : It is absolute $0.05, and last year was $0.04, just [indiscernible] incremental to last year. Mary Winn Pilkington : And Dan, just to clarify, because I have gotten a lot of questions about that, that's always been in our guidance, and we do say that in our prepared remarks. And we said it, called it out earlier in the year as well. So... Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Esteban Gomez : This is Esteban on for Matt. Todd, you commented about an event-driven, low-end consumer. Can you talk about what you saw specifically during Halloween and Thanksgiving and how you would rank your sales initiative we should consider as we head into next year? Todd Vasos : Sure. We -- our Halloween and harvest, and we rolled those 2 together, performed very well. As a matter of fact, both on the sales side and our sell-through exceeded last year by 90 basis points. So we feel very good about the events that we put together for that piece. And we put together a very strong program for Q4, of course, holiday. And we were very happy with our November overall sales. They came in right on our original forecast. And as we now move into December and into the balance of the quarter, we have a lot of shopping ahead of us still, but we feel very good about the plans we have, both in print and in digital as well as in-store. So we are very cautiously optimistic on how the holiday season will end up for us. Esteban Gomez : Great. And then on gross margin, where is your strength today versus historical levels? And what's the best way to think about some of the drivers of gross margin expansion that have helped this year versus areas for upside next year? Todd Vasos : Yes. So our shrink -- we don't usually talk about our shrink and the numbers, but I have to give credit to our store operators and our merchants. They've been working hand in hand now for well -- we always work on it, but well over a year on accelerated working on our shrink levels. And I'm very, very proud of the work that they've done. And those shrink levels continue to come down year-over-year. And shrink is one of the things that is never done. You're always working on shrink. But I have to say that our store operating team has a real good balanced approach to shrink to ensure that we use all of our technology tools and training to make sure that we can continue our shrink improvement as we go into 2016. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler : I'd like to go back to the topic of zero-based budgeting, which is certainly an expression I've heard thrown around. But I'd be interested in knowing how you're thinking about implementing it. What is the process that's involved? John Garratt : Sure. Great question. There's a couple key changes when you move to zero-based budgeting. And I'll say we've had great process rigor and discipline in place here that as you switch to zero-based budgeting, it really is a fundamental process change where you're doing a bottoms-up budget, making trade-offs, enforcing prioritization versus building a budget off of a prior year base. It's also a cost management change focused on dual ownership, where you have department -- traditional department budget owners as well as horizontal cost category experts who help drive increased scrutiny and resource allocation. And then also really driving ownership mind-set where we're putting our best resources against the best uses through the lens that Todd mentioned of what touches the customer, what's aligned with our strategic priorities while also mitigating against risk and making sure we're putting our money where we have the biggest returns. That's why they are the key differences, and we're well into that process of implementing that. The reduction in force was the first stage of that. Now on a go-forward basis, we're focused on driving costs out through indirect spending and continuing to drive a pipeline of savings to continue to drive down that SG&A leverage point and are doing it from a position of strength that positions us very well and solidifies our low cost position and competitive advantage. Meredith Adler : And then if I could guess, I would be a devil's advocate or be a little bit of a cynic. It would seem that you want to lower your leverage point in part because you think that you won't hit the kind of comps you were hitting in the past and that you -- as the business growth slows or the business matures, you just need to lower your leverage point and lower your expenses. Is that too cynical of you? Todd Vasos : Mere, this is Todd. You've known me for a while. And I have to tell you that the way we're approaching this and because it's coming from a position of strength, our goal is to make sure that we can always offer the consumer the lowest price that she can get. And what better way to be able to do that than to pass the savings onto the consumer that we can save that is noncustomer-facing today. I can't think of a better way to do that. And that's our goal. Our goal is to be able to pass on the savings to the consumer, at the same time, by lowering our leverage point. So I think we can do both. I know we can do both. And again, you know Dollar General pretty well. We don't just usually throw things around. We implement them, and we execute them at the top of our game. And this will be no different. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Ruben : This is Andrew Ruben on for Vinny. I just wanted to ask, on the wage side, are you seeing any pressures from either rising minimum wages or from other retailers who are raising their wages and how that might flow through to your labor force? Todd Vasos : Today, we monitor our wages across the United States as you can imagine. And what we're very proud of is that we pay a very, very competitive wage in all of the markets that we serve. In saying that, we continue to watch as wage pressures in some areas are on the rise. But I have to tell you that our operating team in hiring our hourly employees have done a fabulous job. And we are competitive where we need to be competitive. And we've seen virtually no difference today than we have in the past year. So we'll continue to watch that. But rest assured that we'll be in a position through all of our efforts here, including our cost containment that we talked about, to be able to reinvest wherever we need to, to be competitive. Andrew Ruben : Great. That's helpful. And also, on the labor front, you talked about reduced store manager turnover and that leading to reduced associate turnover. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that, whether it's related to perhaps higher pay? Or what some of the other drivers between the reduced turnover could be? Todd Vasos : Yes. The 2 things that are the most very important aspects of turnover and reason that people leave : number one, the relationship with their supervisor; and number two, workflow. And we're addressing both in what we're doing and then coupling that with training. So when you look at how we're approaching it and what we've done and already seeing some success is making sure that we have the right people in place at the district manager level. If you remember, we did some work many quarters ago to realign our districts to get them a little tighter so that they're in the stores more. And that has really helped with our store manager engagement. And as store managers feel better about their district managers, they stay longer. And if they stay longer, your store employees stay longer and happier. It is a cascading event. So it takes time. We can't wave a wand and have to exchange overnight. But I have to tell you, we've made significant progress in a very short period of time with a lot of initiatives yet to come in 2016 and beyond. Operator : Next question is from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Congrats, John. Wanted to just touch-base on the top line. The -- a few-part question. First, just from a competitive standpoint, did you see any disruption in your third quarter results from Family Dollar's significant clearance efforts? Similarly, in the areas where they are rebannering, are you sensing that you're able to pick up share? Also, we've seen some better results out of the discount space with Walmart, with Target. And there is concern that perhaps with lower gas prices, they'll be able to feel more comfortable driving to those boxes and passing up a Dollar store along the way. Just any changes in those specific markets where you are directly competing with some of these competitors would be helpful. Todd Vasos : Yes, Paul, the quarter really showed a very tame pricing environment, to be very honest with you. No significant promotional activity above last year. And I'm happy to say that our price competitiveness is exactly the same as it has been against all channels of trade. So we're very happy with that. And we compete every day just like everyone does with a multitude of different retailers. And the great thing about Dollar General is we've got some fabulous category management process this year that continues to take advantage of every opportunity that may be out there. And I have to say that we saw nice store -- same-store sales growth in many categories, if not, as you've heard already, across all of our consumable and non-consumable areas. So we feel very confident about how we take this forward and about the mix and how we deliver same-store sales. And rest assured, we have a plethora of initiatives coming out for 2016. Paul Trussell : Got it. And as we think about your new store model, perhaps you can just give us a little bit more detail about how you've refined the model. And then just as we think about your store rollout, over 900 stores next year, and expectations for that pace of growth to continue for a few years beyond that, is it necessary for you to go significantly into the urban and suburban markets in order for that to occur? Todd Vasos : Yes. So let me answer your first question, and we're very, very excited about our new store format that we'll be rolling out in 2016. We've tested many components, if not all components of it. We actually already have 4 stores up and running as we speak across different states to test the concept out. But as everything that we do here at Dollar General, we spent a lot of time on the front side with our consumers, seeing what she wanted in that new store. I'll just give you a couple little -- a little tidbits, and you'll hear more from us as we move into 2016. But the great thing about what we're able to deliver in this new format is a more convenient front end for our consumer. She's able to get in, get out quicker, have more product to buy at the front end and is easily navigated throughout the store right in the front end. It really opens up the front end of our stores. It expands our coolers from our current offering of about 16 doors up to 22 doors. And those extra doors will house anything from immediate consumption beverages to additional frozen dairy and perishable-type products. And we've done a lot of other work in health and beauty in our $1 offerings throughout the store in our seasonal areas. So more to come, but right now, it's in the early stages. But we're very, very encouraged in what we see by how that consumer is shopping that new format versus the old format. And then as I look to your other question, we're very, very, very happy with our real estate program and the way that our real estate folks execute on a quarterly basis to open as many stores as we open and, of course, remodel and relo as many as we do. In saying that, we have announced already that we will open 900 next year. So if you think about it, that's a lot of projects today. But more importantly, we don't see anything structurally that gets in the way of a 6% to 7% square footage growth rate as we go out into the outer years. In saying that, those opportunities are a nice fine balance of urban, suburban, if you will, and our rural locations. And that's the great thing about how we've set this up, is that as we continue to open stores in the outer years, it will continue to be a fine balance between those 2. And there's still plenty of opportunities in both urban areas and our metro suburban areas. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Nemer : In the seasonal category, your sales per foot slowed from about 2% over the last 2 quarters to closer to flat this quarter. I'm just wondering if you can talk to some of the reasons behind that. Todd Vasos : Yes, I think one of the biggest differences there is that one Halloween day that shifted in, when you factor that in, it was a little bit more normalized. Matt Nemer : Okay. Any impact from weather in your mind, that maybe there's a different trend in some of the southern tier stores? Todd Vasos : No. Especially in our seasonal pieces, in our pure seasonal pieces, we didn't really see very much weather impact. Obviously, like others in some of our apparel categories, the warmer wet weather slowed some of our early apparels, but we're starting to see finally that cool weather starts to show up. And as it showed up, our apparel sales as well as our other cold weather sales items have increased nicely. So again, we're again cautiously optimistic on all of that as we move into Q4. Matt Nemer : Okay. And then lastly, the 10-Q points to some inventory growth in consumables, which I think is consistent with your efforts to improve in-stocks. But it also called out the home category as a source of inventory growth this quarter. Could you just talk to that change? Todd Vasos : When you look at inventory, we had -- we did have a couple of those headwinds that you mentioned. In some of our non-consumable categories, the biggest shift probably was attributed to the import items that we had a very difficult time getting last year. As you remember, the port slowdown, which had been home and a lot of our non-consumable areas. And this year, products flowed as normal. And so when you look at it year-over-year, it gave us a little bit more inventory than we had last year. But quite frankly, a little bit more normalized that we used to see before that 2014 port slowdown that we were all dealing with. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Edward Kelly : And congratulations, John, as well. Todd, could you just maybe give a little bit of color on the level of inflation that you're seeing in your stores, particularly on the consumable side? We actually have seen deflation in categories like milk, for instance. Just curious as to whether this is having any impact at all on the comp performance. Todd Vasos : Well, like most retailers, we haven't seen a lot of inflation. And as you indicated, some key commodity areas like fluid milks, some coffees, et cetera, we've seen some deflation. Those are big categories for us. So sure, that is a headwind for us in some of our food categories where that deflation has slowed our top line or out-the-door retail a little bit. But the great thing about Dollar General and how we look at the business is any time we can offer the consumer a lower price, it's best for her, and it gives her more money to spend elsewhere and hopefully in our stores. And so we look at it as an advantage as well, and we try to take good care of that consumer on our non-consumable goods, where she may have a little bit more money to spend during her trip. Edward Kelly : And then just one follow-up for you on shrink. Sometimes when you hear retailers talk about focusing on shrink, it can come at the expense of sales. So can you talk just a little bit about the strategy itself, how you ensure that it doesn't come at the expense of sales and whether you've actually seen any of that at all? Todd Vasos : Well, that's another very, very, very good question. And I sort of alluded to it a couple of minutes ago, it is a fine balance when you look at shrink, especially in our environment. And store managers, and I was one at one time, they tend to make sure that they protect the company's assets and their assets. So at times, that could be an issue, and we are no -- we're not immune to that. We're no different. We saw some of that. But the great thing is as we work on our on-shelf availability pieces, we're addressing those. But keep in mind, we also owe our stores tools to make sure that they feel comfortable in putting goods out. So we're rolling out more and more defensive merchandising tools so that we can keep product on the shelf for the consumer and yet have our store managers feel comfortable that it'll be there for sale for the consumer. So we're working both sides of that. And I think in the quarters to come with our efforts around on-shelf availability, it should only add to our in stocks, and it should also only add to our comp store sales. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : Todd, so from 2010 through 2013, the company achieved an operating margin rate of -- I believe, it's like 9.9% to 10.3%. With the expense savings that you're poised to achieve, let's say, beginning next year, do you envision Dollar General operating margin rate returning to that level? Or if I understood your comments earlier, the expense savings that you do achieve, you would give back to the customer, I guess, the lower margin rate. And therefore, the operating margin probably remains about flat going forward. Todd Vasos : Dan, again, we haven't provided guidance obviously for 2016. But let me make sure that I do emphasize : It is our goal, first, to make sure that our consumer is taken care of, but also with an eye to our shareholders. So I would tell you that it'll be a very balanced approach with our zero-based budgeting activities, returning a portion of that back to our shareholders, but also reinvesting in our stores, whether it be price, whether it be labor in our stores, whatever that needs to be to be able to continue to drive our same-store sales at a very robust level. But stay tuned, more to come as we lay out our 2016 plans. Daniel Wewer : Just a second unrelated question, going back to your comments about your customer. So investors were anticipating the significant drop in gasoline prices potentially benefiting the value retailers. I guess, instead, there are some other categories that your customer shops, such as auto parts retailers that certainly did see a benefit. Maybe we got that wrong, but what happens if gasoline prices were -- begin to increase again? Will we be thinking about that as a headwind for the sector? Todd Vasos : How we look at the business is that we operate pretty consistently in high gas price or low gas price environments. When that price is high and she is strapped, we're a great alternative for her. And when it's lower and she may have a little bit more money, we're hoping that she spends it with us. But to your point, she seems to be spending this -- in this savings in gas prices a little differently. I think you almost look at it as she's sort of spending on deferred maintenance for her household. So -- and whether it be the automobile they didn't quite fix because they didn't have the money, or the refrigerator that they've been putting off buying for the last few years. Looks like she's spending money on that right now. But like everything is cyclical, it will come back around. And I believe that we'll be able to service our consumer in either one of those 2 environments on the energy price level. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne Agee, CRT. Charles Grom : Congrats, John, as well. But just on the inventories, a little bit more heavy than we're used to seeing. You cited the sales performance as a factor. I guess, how are you thinking about inventory levels by the end of the year? And as a tie-in to that question, when we look at your margin outlook for the fourth quarter, I think Michael asked this in his first question, what should we think about gross margins in the fourth quarter considering inventories are a little bit heavy? John Garratt : Sure. Our goal for inventory growth has been and always is to be -- keep it in line with sales growth over time. That doesn't happen every quarter, and this was one of those quarters. I'll start by saying our inventory is in great shape. If you look at of the increase, it was in consumables and core inventories. So no concerns there. And there's actions in place to reduce this. If you look at the third quarter, it was impacted, as we said, by on-shelf availability initiative as well as timing of receipts, which included imports as well as it was impacted by the sales performance. As we look ahead to Q4, there are some continued headwinds as we look at inventory projected levels there. We will be, again, lapping the West Coast port slowdown issue, which had inventory unusually low for imports this time last year -- in the fourth quarter last year. We also have an earlier Easter season, which will cause an earlier flow of inventory in the fourth quarter. And we will be stocking up to open our DC in San Antonio. So with the combination -- there are headwinds, which will impact our ability to get inventory all the way back in line with sales. But we do see that coming back in line over time and have actions in place to do so. Charles Grom : Helpful. And then anything on the gross margins for 4Q? John Garratt : Sure. As I mentioned before, in terms of gross margins, we look at gross margins and SG&A together in terms of hitting our goal, and we're very comfortable with the 8% guidance we provided. We'll work with both those levels. We're -- as we said before, we're going to deliver better performance this year than last year and the year before on overall operating margin, are very comfortable with hitting that number for Q4 and growing that going forward, leveraging the leverage we mentioned on gross margin as well as the strength of the zero-based budgeting actions we've taken will help us. Charles Grom : Okay, great. And then just my last question is on the sales-driving initiatives, you alluded to expanding the number of cooler doors in new stores. Can you just remind us, is there a plan to go back to your existing fleet and also expand the number of doors where possible? Todd Vasos : That's another great question, Chuck. And yes, a matter of fact, we'll have a plan and have a plan in place for 2016 to go back to many of our legacy stores. This is very easily backwards compatible, if you will. And you'll see that in 2016 because it is a driver of our traffic and continues to be, so look forward to that in '16. Charles Grom : Okay. And then if I could sneak one more in just [indiscernible]. Mary Winn Pilkington : One more. Charles Grom : Sorry. If we reflect back to Rick's comments back in April about the consumer, he was particularly upbeat. And if you read the press release today, you've got some language in there, it's certainly a little bit more sobering. And just want to clarify that. Is that a reflection -- and I think you've alluded to this and answered it. But I just want to make sure that it's -- that you're okay with November sales, and you're not seeing anything that's just more of a reflection of the overall kind of macro consumer environment that we've seen over the past 60 days. Todd Vasos : Yes. Again, our November sales were right on our original plan or original forecast. So we feel very strong about November. And when you look at the overall comment, it is the environment that our consumer is in. Our consumer is always under pressure. I mean, she lives that way, but she's so resilient, and she figures it out. But she needs us to help her figure it out, and that's what we're here to do. She is facing a lot of headwinds, especially in rents. I mean, rents are up tremendously over the past few years. Our core consumer, our core, core consumer, nearly 50% of her take-home pay is going to rent today versus just a few short years ago, 37%. So you can see the headwind that she's gotten. And quite frankly, not a lot of wage growth for her. So there's a lot of other pressures that the core consumer has, but we feel very good about our offering and how we service that consumer. And I think we've shown it over the years, and the consumer is voting by coming to the Dollar General. Mary Winn Pilkington : So operator, that will wrap up our call today. I just want to say thank you to everyone for joining our call. Please stay tuned for a save the date for our Investor Day, as Todd mentioned, on March 23 and 24, and we'll look forward to seeing everyone then. And thank you for your interest in Dollar General. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. You may now disconnect.",

Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call.  Today, we reported record results for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full year. 2015 was an exciting year for Dollar General as we reached over $20 billion in sales and celebrated the milestone of opening our 12,000th store location.  Today's announced 14% increase in our quarterly cash dividend reaffirms our continued confidence in our long-term growth prospects. For the year, we had our most balanced financial growth since 2011, and delivered results that are in line with the long-term financial model that we announced today. The team is energized by the strong performance in 2015 and is focused on capturing the significant long-term growth opportunities that lie ahead.  Let's recap some of the additional highlights of 2015. Full year net sales increased 7.7% to a record $20.4 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $226. Same-store sales for the year increase by 2.8%, marking our 26th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. Our same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.2%. In the quarter, same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and non-consumables.  For the year, operating profit increased above [ph] 10% with diluted earnings per share up 13%. Earnings per share improved 11% in the quarter to $1.30 per share. For the 32nd consecutive quarter-over-quarter, we increased both customer traffic and average ticket. During the year, we returned nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 17.6 million shares of common stock and the payment of dividends. We opened 730 new stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6% and exceeded our combined remodels and relocation targets with 881 stores.  For 7 years now, our real estate projects have had strong performance. The class of stores in 2014 and 2015 continue to run ahead of our projections. And we are pleased with the performance in the new states we entered in early 2015. Our distribution center in San Antonio, Texas, was completed in January and started shipping to stores in February. We also broke ground on our 14th distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin, to help us serve our growing store base in the Midwest. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network and to support our growing store base, all while reducing our stem miles.  In 2015, we accomplished the multiyear rollout of our enterprise resource planning software for our supply chain. This technology platform represents a significant improvement with enhanced integration to allow for demand forecasting from the vendor to shelf. Importantly, the team executed this initiative without disruption to our business. The rollout of our targeted labor investments has been implemented across more than 3,100 stores. Since the rollout of this initiative in the second quarter, we have continued to see same-store sales growth for our stores gained traction. Phase 1 and 2 stores have been on the program long enough to see an impact. We are pleased that they are delivering on our return expectations. Specifically, in these stores, the key metrics of same-store sales, transactions, average basket and customer satisfaction scores, all are showing significant improvement.  We also had continuing success in improving our shrink performance. Shrink improvement has been, and continues to be, one of our largest long-term gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reducing our shrink on a store-by-store basis. This progress continues to be broad-based with shrink declining across nearly 70% of our product departments for the year. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to further reduce shrink.  We are constantly striving to fill the needs to meet the changing demands of our customers. We continued to increase our overall market share of consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the 4-,12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending January 29, 2016. In the 2015 fourth quarter, we had very solid same-store sales growth of 2.2%, particularly considering the 2014 fourth quarter same-store sales growth of 4.9%.  In consumables, growth was driven primarily by candy and snacks, tobacco and perishables. Growth in the non-consumable categories was broad-based with notable strength across seasonal and home, offset by a modest decline in apparel. Even as apparel had a modest decline given the unseasonably warm weather, we had strong growth across holiday events, housewares, home decor, toys and stationery. Our offerings in non-consumables are on trend and priced right for the key Christmas holiday season. This represented the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in our non-consumable categories.  Everything we do at Dollar General is centered around our customers. The good news is that our customers are noticing the improvements we are making in our stores, especially as it relates to our on-shelf availability. As we exited 2015, we had our highest customer satisfaction scores in 2 years. As these results indicate, we made excellent progress on a number of fronts in 2015.  As we move into 2016, we have updated our customer segmentation to gain deeper insights into the most relevant groups as the consumer continues to change at a rapid pace. This customer segmentation helps guide our strategies to grow with each of our core customer segments. This was the first recut of our customer segmentation since 2012.  The new segmentation of our customer, one of the most exciting findings is that we are growing with our most productive customers. These are exciting developments that confirm we are improving our core shopper productivity, while also attracting new key segments, and importantly, retaining our trade-down customers. These updated customer segmentation findings are integrated across merchandising and pricing, marketing, site selection and store operations and design. We look forward to sharing more insights at our upcoming Investor Day. The goal is to grow transactions and item units, which continue to be key to our market share performance. Our operating priorities continue to include : Driving profitable sales growth; continuing growth opportunities; enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.  Our first priority is continuing to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips and capture share with existing customers, the insights gained from our customer segmentation work are incorporated into our disciplined approach to category management. In this process, we have assessed the expansion of categories that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. Health and beauty, perishables, party and stationery are areas where we are expanding in 2016.  For 2016, the team is very focused on implementing these sales-driving initiatives across, not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also to our mature store base to a greater degree than we have in the last several years.  Our ongoing affordability initiative will be front and center with a refreshed approach.  We will also leverage operational initiatives, such as improving our on-shelf availability. We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion through improvements in shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution and transportation efficiencies and non-consumable sales. Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Examples include our accelerated square footage growth in 2016 with a new store layout that we started utilizing in February for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. While it's still early, the results of this DG '16 layout are very encouraging as our sales performance is meeting our expectations.  In addition, we have been conducting a test and learn for a smaller format store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. Currently, we have opened approximately 30 stores with selling space of less than 6,000 square feet or about 20% smaller than our traditional stores.  Sales productivity and returns based on the early results are very encouraging. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our urban customers, we believe this smaller format store will allow us to have higher capture rate for site selection. Additionally, we believe this smaller format will work in rural locations with lower household counts. With this smaller format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites. Looking ahead, we anticipate opening 900 new stores, including about 80 of the smaller format stores and relocating or remodeling an additional 875 locations in fiscal 2016. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth with a proven high-return, low-risk model. We are disciplined and focused on financial returns. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2016, and our pipeline is full.  Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. We recently adopted zero-based budgeting to proactively improve our efficiencies and reduce expenses over a multiyear time frame, all while giving us the flexibility to reinvest savings to drive growth. Our zero-based budgeting approach is a refreshed commitment to removing costs from our business. Our 2016 budget was built through a zero-based budgeting perspective with a clear and defined process to address spending. All of these actions are filtered through 3 lenses. One, is it customer-facing? Second, does it align with our strategic priorities? And finally third, how does it impact our risk profile? Over the last several years, our SG&A leverage point on comp sales has been running at approximately 3.5% and was trending at a rate that would have been higher in out-years if we had not taken action. Today, our zero-based budgeting initiatives, we have lowered the SG&A leverage point on comp sales to about 2.5% to 3%. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication. In 2015, we had our lowest level of store manager turnover in 3 years. To build on these improvements going forward, we have been focused on aligning our talent with the right skill set required for success based on store characteristics in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover.  For our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that it is always challenging for our core consumer given the pressures on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. Now, let me turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. While Todd has taken you through the highlights of 2015 and our strategic initiatives for 2016, let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter and year. I will also spend some time discussing our long-term financial growth model and our guidance convention going forward.  Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 31.8% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 12 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Lower transportation costs and an improved rate of inventory shrink were the primary factors of the improved performance, while increased markdowns were a partial offset. This quarter represented our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in gross margin.  For the quarter, total SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was even with last year's fourth quarter at 20.2%. The 2015 fourth quarter results reflect increases in incentive compensation expenses, retail salaries and occupancy costs, offset by lower utility costs and administrative salaries as a percentage of sales. The 2014 quarter results reflect expenses of $6.1 million or 12 basis points, as a percentage of sales, related to the acquisition that was not completed. Our tax rate for the quarter was 36.1% compared to 34.8% in the 2014 quarter. This included a $16.5 million or $0.06 per share benefit from the re-enactment of the Federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which is retroactive to January 1, 2015. The fourth quarter of 2014 also benefited from the deductibility of expenses incurred in prior quarters associated with the acquisition that was not completed.  Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and cash equivalents at year-end were $422 million lower than the prior year as we did not buy back shares in the second half of 2014 due to the pending acquisition. Merchandise inventories were $3 billion at fiscal 2015 year-end, up about 4.3% on a per-store basis year-over-year. Key factors impacting this increase include our on-shelf availability initiative, the load-in for the new distribution center in San Antonio and the timing of receipts due to an early Easter, coupled with our sales performance. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Near term, we would expect our ongoing on-shelf availability initiative to impact our inventory level. Going forward, however, our goal remains to ensure inventory growth is in line with our total sales growth over time. In 2015, we generated cash from operations of $1.4 billion, an increase of $63 million from the prior year. Total capital expenditures were $505 million in 2015, and included the majority of the costs for our new San Antonio distribution center. For the quarter, we repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock for $290 million. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding, totaling $63 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased $3.6 billion or 62 million shares of our common stock. We have a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $920 million under the repurchase program. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth. Our goal is to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.  We are modifying our guidance convention going forward to more closely align with how we are managing the business for long-term shareholder value creation. This is a tremendous business. We have compelling new store economics with significant runway for growth, across channel, customer and product segments that we intend to capture. From our vantage point, the growth model we announced today is more of an articulation of how we have been managing the business to deliver consistent, profitable growth and not a change in strategy. In addition, we have heard from our investors that they would like to know what we think our business is capable of over the long term.  We believe that this long-term focus is the best way to model our business. Key components of the model include the following annual targets : Net sales increase of 7% to 10% with square footage growth of 6% to 8% and same-store sales improvement of 2% of 4%; operating profit growth of 7% to 11%; diluted earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%; cash from operations to be 7% to 8% of sales; capital expenditures to be 2% to 3% of sales; and annual shareholder returns of 11% to 17% defined as EPS growth plus dividend yield.  In 2016, we anticipate share repurchases of approximately $1 billion. This represents about 5% of our market capitalization as of today. Since the inception of our share repurchases in December of 2011, we have reduced our outstanding share count by about 15%. Given that fiscal 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year for us, we expect the 53rd week to contribute approximately 200 basis points to our net sales performance and $0.09 per diluted share to EPS. Including the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, we expect our net sales and diluted EPS results to be at the high end of the growth ranges provided in our financial growth model as I just outlined. We anticipate that same-store sales growth will be near the middle of the model's 2% to 4% growth rate.  As we move into 2016, please keep in mind our most challenging sales overlaps are in the first and second quarters. We do pick up 2 additional sales dates between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Also, for 2016, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million. At the beginning of today's call, Mary Winn outlined our intentions with respect to updating our 2016 guidance. This information is also in our earnings release issued today. We are confident that we are positioning Dollar General for profitable long-term growth to drive shareholder returns.  Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thanks, John. In summary, 2015 was a great year for Dollar General. We were able to deliver record financial performance, while positioning the company to capture accelerated square footage growth. We continue to have significant opportunities for high-return, low-risk organic growth. I look forward to sharing more details about our long-term strategies at our Investor Day scheduled for March 24, here in Nashville, where we plan to further discuss our growth drivers for the long term.  Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividends.  I would like to thank the more than 113,000 Dollar General employees for all their hard work during the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015, all while fulfilling our mission of serving others. As a team, we are looking forward to 2016 as we build on our performance from 2015.  With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : All right. Josephine, we'll take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So on square footage growth, 6% to 8% growth in the long-term algorithm is definitely an uptick. Can you talk about productivity levels, four-wall return profile that you're seeing on some of the newer stores? And is the key here the smaller store format and the metro store opportunity, is that the driver to include 8% at the top of the range now? Todd Vasos : Matt, this is Todd. So just real quick. I think the way to look at this is a couple of things. Number one, we are very confident in our real estate model as we go forward. Matter of fact, our returns are still some of the highest that I've seen at consumable retail at 18% to 20% and still running there. We don't see that changing in the near term at all. Matter of fact, I believe you hit on it. Some of the newer opportunities that have been unlocked in metro and in smaller rural areas with smaller household counts, because of our new smaller store, it gives us the confidence as we go forward that we can actually expand that -- that square footage growth if we think we need to as we go forward. So not only are we confident about where we've been, but where we're going with new store growth. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow up on margins. Todd, you laid out, I think, 4 to 5 drivers of continued gross margin opportunity here going forward. And the fixed cost hurdle rate, as you called out, is now reduced to 2.5% to 3% from 3.5%, yet the long-term model calls for very little in the way of EBIT margin expansion. Any structural headwinds I'm missing that you can't potentially beat even these -- given these targets that you just laid out? Todd Vasos : No, we don't see anything structurally changing, Matthew. And as you alluded to, we really look to manage our gross margin and SG&A in tandem. And we continue to have numerous levers within gross margin. We were delighted with the performance this year on gross margin delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And we continue to see benefits from the numerous levers. We continue to drive shrink rates lower over the quarter. We continued to see transportation efficiencies. We continue to grow our non-consumables business, 8 quarters of consecutive improvement, which, as you know, carries a higher margin rate with it. And we continue to effectively manage all the additional levers of category management, private label penetration, foreign sourcing penetration and distribution efficiencies. And we continue to see opportunities for growth on the gross margin side and on the SG&A side, with the introduction of zero-based budgeting, we've always had a very disciplined cost management process here with work elimination, but with zero-based budgeting implemented from a position of strength, that's one more tool at our disposal to manage that. So as we look at the 2 in tandem, we continue to see operating profit margin expansion growth over time. That's contemplated in our model. And as you look at the opportunity to drive total shareholder returns of 11% to 17% each year and the potential -- and we're really focused on the long-term growth as well. So the ability to drive those types of returns in a consistent manner and deliver long-term value creation is really what we're focused on and what we've built into the model. Operator : Your next question comes from Vinny Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Wanted to, I guess, first ask, just go back to the small format store commentary. Can you just give us a little bit more of a sense for with the initial, I guess, you said 30 or so today, how close to kind of urban markets? What's the definition of urban for you? Are they literally in cities or are they just closer to those areas? How far from your core stores? Maybe just a little further color there would be helpful? Todd Vasos : Yes, sure. The 30, obviously, are dispersed in many different locations because we wanted to make sure we tested it in a lot of different urban settings. But, I think, the key here is it is in urban areas. So not satellite city as much as true urban-type areas, where dense populations, condominium-type living, those type areas. And that's where we've tried to test this, and we've seen that success. And again, what this also unlocks for us is it unlocks some real estate for us because again the 7,400 square foot box, while very, very productive, it's a little tougher in metro -- true metro areas to get that size of a location. And this gives us the flexibility to also get into some smaller spaces in some of those densely populated areas. So it's really been a win-win on both sides, both from our sales and productivity and as well as from our real estate side. Vincent Sinisi : Okay, and maybe just a quick follow-up to that. With the store plans for 80 of these things out of the total next year, at this point, do you think that's kind of the, at least, the proportion of the new stores that would be in this smaller format going forward? Todd Vasos : Yes, the 7,400 square foot store is still going to be our workhorse. I want to make sure you realize that. That is still the most productive box that we put out there, and will continue to be. So I would think it would be fair to say that, that proportion is probably pretty close over the next couple of years to where it's at today. And if that changes, we'll definitely let everyone know. Vincent Sinisi : Okay, and if I can just slide one fast one in there. Regarding shrink, you continue to have very nice improvement there, yet it's, of course, still the consistent commentary that it's one of your real opportunities still going forward. Can you tell us if there's anything overly different that you're doing today, whether it's types of things in-store, category, work, just anything further there? Todd Vasos : Well, Vinny, you know that -- shrink at retail for sure is always a challenge and a battle, right? It never ends. But I have to tell you that our team, both on the operational side of the equation and on the merchandising side of the equation, are very focused on working together to make that box not only productive from a sales standpoint but also to make sure that we have as much defensive merchandising tools in place that we can have, not only the -- some of the cabinets that we put in, but also where we place product. And as we go into 2016 and beyond, what you're going to see from us is more of an opportunity to in high, high shrink stores to take our merchandising mix and maybe change it a little bit, especially, as it relates to where you place product in these higher shrink stores to ensure that we can continue to show some type of shrink progress. But again, make no mistake, it's always going to be a challenge, and we continue to work it from all sides. Mary Winn Pilkington : [Operator Instructions] Operator : Your next question comes from John Zolidis from Buckingham Research. John Zolidis : I also going to ask about the stores, and I noted that in the press release you talked about some of the stores being financed by leases and others being built by the company. I was wondering if you could talk about your approach going forward to capital investment in the stores. And how that potentially impacts the return on invested capital going forward? John Garratt : Yes, our strategy's really unchanged there. We're predominantly leased, we're less than 5% owned. And so that will continue to be our vehicle is the build-to-suit lease store. No change there. John Zolidis : Okay, great. So then for a follow-up, could you just talk about a little bit more on the labor pressures that are out there in the market. I know that's a concern of many investors, and we'd like to hear a little bit more about how you're seeing that impact your hiring of employees at the store level? Todd Vasos : Yes. We are monitoring, and we always have our wages, both from our hourly rates as well as our store managers. And while we remain very committed to ensure that we pay competitive rates out there, and we'll continue to do that, but I have to tell you, what we have seen as we exited 2015 and now entering 2016, our critical staffing at the hourly level is at the highest levels that we've seen in a couple of years. And that's very good because what that shows is that our pool of candidates coming in are very, very robust. So while we'll always monitor it and we will definitely pay competitive wages, which we have, and will continue to do so, we haven't seen the overwhelming pressure as of yet that some have been talking about. But at the end of the day, for our hourly folks, the great thing about it is that they can quickly move up from being an hourly associate to being a key carrier and even an assistant manager in very short order. And we like to say here and when we recruit people that we can actually take someone from a job to a career in less than a couple of years. And you don't really find that very often, especially in consumable retailing. Operator : Your next question comes from Meredith Adler from Barclays. Meredith Adler : Two questions for you, if I could. The first is just to talk a little bit about as you continue to grow somewhere square footage growth of, let's say, 7%. You're opening a lot of stores, and I know you've said you need to open a distribution center pretty frequently. I think it used to be you were saying every year, now maybe you're saying every 18 months. Have you done anything to improve the productivity of the distribution centers so that you don't have to open as many as frequently? Todd Vasos : Yes, we have, Meredith, and we have done that over the years. I think what we have said in the past that about every 1,000 to 1,100 stores, give or take, we would need to open in a DC, but we've seen that grow over the last few years, maybe now 1,200 stores, 1,250. So the productivity inside that four-wall continues to improve. And so we see that probably it's going to average out to almost one a year based on our current square footage growth. But again, that's because of that probably closer 1,200 to 1,250 stores. Meredith Adler : Okay, great. And then just a quick question about SNAP, which I know is not a huge piece of your revenues. But I think the FDA is talking about making some changes to qualifying for SNAP. And I'm wondering if you guys are looking at that? And kind of what you think that means for your business? Todd Vasos : Yes, Meredith, we are watching that. And we, as you know, and you mentioned earlier, SNAP for us is approximately 5% of our sales. So it really has -- it's not a huge piece of the business, but yet, our core consumer does rely on SNAP benefits in a lot of cases. But in saying that, the great thing here about Dollar General, and we'll continue to monitor it, is that we offer her a great value proposition at the price. So whether she's pinched a little bit with SNAP or not, she can definitely come here to Dollar General and get all her needs. And we'll continue to deliver on that promise to her because she actually comes to us to make sure we can deliver on it. Meredith Adler : So you'll adjust your offering if you need to, to satisfy any new rules? Todd Vasos : Absolutely. We think that we're in pretty good shape right now. And if we need to add an item or 2, a couple of lines, then we'll -- we're very willing to do that. As you know, we've got our Plus store and our Market stores out there, and they're a great test bed for all of that. And so we know exactly what sells in there. And if we need to add some things into our traditional stores, we'll add the best items based on those sales that we already know in our existing stores. Operator : Your next question comes from Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Edward Kelly : So my question for you, one question here just on the cost side and zero-based budgeting. Could you just talk a little bit about sort of what you've learned as you've gone through the process here? And then your guidance of leverage on 2.5% to 3%. Is that what you think is now like a reasonable place to be? Or is there opportunity to do more than that or do better than that, I guess, long term? Or is that just like you're a responsible retailer today that's what the environment sort of brings? John Garratt : Well, I can say that the zero-based budgeting has really been embraced by the team here. It's an extension of our culture where we've always had a robust budgeting process and cost discipline. But by undertaking this from a position of strength, it really enables us to go deeper and to uncover additional savings opportunities that we're able to capture in our bottoms-up budget. And again, as we went through this, and because we did it from a position of strength, we're really able to go through it with a filter that Todd mentioned of moving out those costs that didn't touch the customer, that weren't aligned with our strategic priorities, that didn't present risk and allowing us to put it in the most productive places. And the team has really rallied upon that. It's really changed the mindset in terms of how we look at the business and people apply this filter in everything we do. And we're delighted with having actions in place coming into this year, built into the budget that allows us to move that leverage point from 3.5% to 2.5% to 3%, while allowing for some targeted reinvestments in the business to keep that consistent growth going. We think that's a good place to be. We see our ability to continue that. And the team is very hard at work, working on the future pipeline of savings projects to keep that leverage point low, and we'll get it as low as we can. Edward Kelly : And then just one quick follow-up. Todd, I heard you mention expansion of perishables or focus on perishables. Could you just maybe give a little bit more color on what you're talking about there? Todd Vasos : Sure. Our core consumer continues to tell us that one of the main drivers for a trip to Dollar General is the frozen and refrigerated offerings that we have. So what we have planned for 2016 is in all of our new remodel and relocation stores taking our cooler count from about 16 doors up to 20 to 22 doors. Along with that, we have put together a very strong backward-compatible program to add additional coolers into our existing same-store base. Now it won't be all of our stores right away, but we see this as probably a 2- to 3-year horizon as we go back to add more coolers to our existing base, all while adding up to 22 doors in all of our new stores. So it's really a combination of both refrigerated and frozen offerings that we can put forth to our consumer. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Keith from Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : I want to focus in on the outlook for same-store sales at the midpoint of that 2% to 4% range, so it kind of implies 3%. Just looking at the last 2 quarters, you guys were running in the low 2s. So the guidance suggests some acceleration in 2016. And I guess -- I was hoping you could expand upon that if you think some of the company-specific initiatives will help get you there? Or you see something on the macro front or even near term that looks encouraging? Todd Vasos : I think as you look at this, first of all, I want to say our merchandise initiatives should gain traction as it goes through the year. The laps were a little tougher in the beginning of the year and get little easier towards the back. But make no bones about it, our initiatives that we've got this year are the strongest that I've seen here in the last 2 to 3 years. Not only the perishable that I just talked about, but as I talked about in my prepared remarks, our health and beauty initiative as well as our party and stationery pieces really should help drive some of those initiatives as we go forward. You couple that with the work that our operators are doing on on-shelf availability and making product available when the consumer comes in the door at a very high rate, we think that guiding in where we did makes a lot of sense. But we feel very confident as we go forward this year into 2016 where that comp is headed. Peter Keith : Okay. That's helpful. Maybe on a related note too, so Walmart had closed a number of the Express stores over a month ago. Those look to be quite close to a lot of Dollar General stores. I was wondering if you could provide maybe or even quantify if there's been some benefit or anything that you think actually might move the needle on a total company basis for 2016. Todd Vasos : Well, anytime you have a competitor that leaves the space, you do get some benefit. The one thing that we're squarely focused on is making sure that any dislocation that happens from those closings, that as they come into Dollar General, we have got a superior box to offer her the right products at the right price and have it available when she needs it. So we're working real hard on that. But keep in mind, it's only about 100 stores, plus or minus, that they've closed. And with our vast, now 12,000, almost 500 stores, it is a smaller number on our total store base. But we are really looking to control what we can control, and that is if she comes in, we've got an offering that we hope that will keep her for life. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Want to just go back to margins. I look back and I don't think you guys have leveraged expenses since 2013 perhaps. So getting that leverage threshold down is quite an accomplishment. But I did want to be very clear on how we should be modeling this year. As we look at your costs accelerating in the back half of the year, should we be thinking that you will have the ability to leverage expenses? Or maybe you can just give a little bit more clarity around gross margins versus SG&A expectations for this year? John Garratt : Yes, and again, I think the best way to look at it is in terms of looking at operating margin, looking at gross margin and SG&A in tandem, as that's the way we manage it, managing all the levers within that. But I think the best thing I can point you to is again our annual target of the operating profit growth. We're going to work both those levers to deliver that operating profit growth, and we feel comfortable with where we sit right now with the continued opportunities around gross margin with where we've lowered the leverage point on SG&A to deliver that operating profit growth, which is a very strong operating profit growth this year and in the foreseeable future. Paul Trussell : Got it, got it. It's dangerous leaving these types of things to our imagination, but I'll run with that. Just following up also on the top line, in addition to the expanded categories you mentioned, I believe a refreshed affordability initiative. If perhaps you can just give a little bit more color on what we should expect to see there? And also just give us an update on what the results have been in that value valley? Todd Vasos : Yes, and Paul, that is the real piece there, and that is the value valley area. In our new remodels and relocations, we have got a new fresh approach there, expanded the section, but also moved it to the front of the store, so it's more prevalent and can be seen a lot more. And also signed it a little differently for the stores. And then what we'll do is some of the best of the best of that expansion, we'll start to put it into our same-store sales base as we move further into the year to ensure that we can take advantage on a same-store sales base as well. They key for our value offering that we have is it really -- what it does, it gives the consumer trial. You have to remember, our core consumer can ill afford to make a mistake. So she can't afford to take a flyer, if you will, to go out and buy something at -- on a national brand basis that may be a little larger size without ever having tried it. But if we can offer her a national brand offering, as an example, at a very small size that she can afford, say, at $1, it gives her that trial. And once she has that trial, what we've seen is it becomes then -- it migrates into acceptance, and she moves from that $1 offering and actually trades up to the larger sizes. So our national brand folks really like what they're seeing there, and of course, we do as well, and it's great for our consumer. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : On the 6,000 square foot prototype, you noted that you would be eliminating less productive inventory for that smaller box, presumably that's apparel. Have you considered making that same change in the 7,400 square foot store? Todd Vasos : Yes, again, it's more than apparel, Dan, as you can imagine. But apparel does get pulled down somewhat in this model. But to answer your question, we consistently and constantly look at every year going in with our robust category management system, what areas we need to contract and what areas we need to continue to expand on. And the great thing about apparel, at least in the last couple of years, is we've seen some nice growth in apparel. Now obviously, we had a little bit of a weather hiccup here in Q4, but we don't see our apparel business slowing down as we go into 2016. Matter of fact, we're pretty bullish on apparel. Cindy Long, her team have done a really nice job in giving us some very competitive offering there. But again, we'll continue to monitor all categories, and if we feel we need to contract at times and expand in others, we'll definitely do so. Daniel Wewer : It looks like the sales per square foot in the 6,000 square foot store could be considerably higher given the difference in the merchandise mix and the more densely populated markets. What would be the offset? Is it a lower margin rate because you have less apparel? Or do you expect expenses to be higher, particularly, in the urban locations? Todd Vasos : Yes, I think you've hit on a couple of things, Dan, is that expenses are a little higher there because of that urban nature. But again, because of that 6,000 square foot box, we can keep that also from getting too far out of bounds because, again, trying to manage 6,000 square feet versus the 7,400 square foot workhorse that we have is a little less complex. Then you couple that with the changing of the mix, and depending on the area that we put these stores, the consumable mix does increase a little bit, which does put a little pressure on gross margin rate. But again, when you look at overall return, because of the smaller box, it costs less to get into it, it costs less -- or it doesn't cost as much to operate it from a lot of different areas, and then, couple that with some good sales and sales per square foot, which is higher than our normal box, then the whole equation works pretty nicely. Daniel Wewer : And just real quickly. Of the 80 of these that you opened this year, how many will actually be in a very small rural markets? Todd Vasos : Yes, I don't know if we really have talked about that, but I could tell you that it's going to be a nice balance because what we want to do is really look at how it works in -- of the 30 that we have open, I can tell you that we've got a few open in the rural markets and we've got the majority of them right now opened up in the metro markets. And so that balance is probably going to still be heavily weighted right now to metro. But as we go forward, we're seeing some real opportunities in the rural markets with those lower households. And again, that's why we're guiding long-term upwards of 8% square footage growth because there could be some real benefit as we go out in outer years. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : So you mentioned the expansion in coolers, but can you also help us size the expansion in health and beauty as well as perishables, and maybe where the space is potentially coming from and also address how the expansion in these areas are being balanced with the shrink initiatives, you cited, given some of the challenges inherent with these categories? Todd Vasos : Yes, as we look at health and beauty, it is one of our categories that we're the least penetrated in today. And with that said, there is really a lot of opportunity. And again because of our convenient nature, our consumers are asking us for more and more of our health and beauty offering. Now in saying that, as we look at our new stores where a lot of the health and beauty initiatives will be put into place, the new store design opened up some opportunity for us in that we didn't have to take out a lot of product to be able to put some of that health and beauty initiative in. It's somewhere in that 6- to 8-plus feet. It depends on the store. It could go upwards of 16 feet in some areas. But what we're doing is we're not -- this isn't a one size fits all either. We're taking a look at shrink, we're taking a look at where the stores are located. And the other nice thing about this is it has a healthy balance of private brands. And as we all know, private brands, very good profitability, but also doesn't shrink near as much as your national brands. So I think when you couple all that together, I think this should be a real win for our consumers at Dollar General. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up, if I may. You had talked about the digital coupon platform, I think, last quarter. Can you just provide us an update on what you're seeing there and the potential opportunities to maybe leverage that platform as you've resegmented the customer? Todd Vasos : Yes, we've been pleasantly surprised. My goodness, we are up to now over 2.5 million subscribers, if you will, users. And we continue to see sign-ups very robust. The great thing that we're seeing here is that the basket size is significantly larger than our normal basket size without using digital coupons. And the other thing that our marketeers, along with our IT department, have recently done has made sign-up at the store very, very, very easy. Matter of fact, we went from -- to over 3 to 4 minutes to sign-up to now we can sign-up in a minute or less. And that has really helped propel the sign-ups at store level. So we're very bullish on what that will bring us into 2016 and beyond. And you have to remember, some of this newfound money that our consumer has gotten over the last year to 1.5 years between going back to work and less gas -- and the gas prices being a little lower, she's reinvested some of that findings for her into smartphones. And we have seen that our smartphone usage from our core consumer has gone up a lot. Matter of fact, it has now -- has crested over 85%, where just a few short years ago, we were in the 40-some percent range on usage. So you couple all that, she is now ready to really go digital. And we're on the forefront of that for her. Mary Winn Pilkington : So we've hit the top of the hour, so I think we'll call it a day right here. But we do look forward to seeing everybody in Nashville in a couple of weeks. If you have any questions, please let me know, and we're around all day for questions. Thank you very much. Operator : That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases. Let me caution you to that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters including, but not limited to, our fiscal 2016, 2017 store growth, fiscal 2016 initiative, capital allocation strategy and related expectations, our long-term financial growth model and future economic trends or conditions. Forward-looking statements can be identified because they are not statements of historical facts and use words such as outlook, may, should, could, believe, anticipate, expect, looking ahead, focused on, estimate, forecast, goal or intend, and similar expressions that concern our strategies, plan, intentions or beliefs about future occurrences or results. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those projected or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2015 10-K filed on March 22, 2016, and our most recent 10-Q filed today and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call, except as follows : we previously outlined [Audio Gap] model and certain 2016 financial guidance in our press release issued on March 10, 2016. As noted in that release, we plan to update our diluted EPS guidance only if we no longer reasonably expect diluted EPS to fall within the 10% to 15% range outlined in the growth model, and we generally do not intend and specifically disclaim any duty to update our expectations regarding where in the range of guidance net sales, same-store sales or diluted EPS may fall or to update any component of the growth model other than diluted EPS as just referenced. As we noted in that press release, we also do not intend and specifically disclaim any duty to update our dollar range for expected fiscal 2016 capital expenditures unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws. Our comments today will be consistent with the approach we just outlined. We will not discuss and will not answer any questions regarding the quarter's results as related to the long-term growth model or the specific 2016 financial guidance first given on March 10, 2016. However, due to our accelerated store growth plans during this call, we are discussing our square footage growth targets for 2016 and 2017. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Mary Winn, and welcome to everyone joining our call. As we noted in our press release, we had a very good start to the year and are pleased with our results. For the first quarter, the team executed well as we were keenly focused on ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of every aspect of our business. Let's recap some of the highlights for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the 2015 period.  First quarter sales increased 7% to $5.3 billion. We delivered same-store sales growth of 2.2% for the quarter, and in an environment where many retailers struggled, we delivered good performance. Same-store sales growth was positive for both consumables and non-consumables, with growth stronger across our consumable categories. Growth in non-consumables was due to seasonal and home products. For the 33rd consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket year-over-year. Gross margin expanded by 16 basis points to 30.6%. We leveraged selling, general and administrative expenses by 26 basis points as our zero-based budget initiatives started to contribute to our results. Operating profit increased 12% with operating profit margin expansion of 42 basis points. Net income in the first quarter increased 17% to $295 million. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $1.03, including a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate, which John will discuss later. During the quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.7 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. In the first quarter, we made notable progress against our key initiatives for 2016. As I will discuss in more detail a bit later in the call, the team has done a great job of developing compelling initiatives across merchandising, store operations and supply chain to help drive our business in 2016 and for the long term. Additionally, we continue to grow transaction and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced relatively consistent mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our first quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results, starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.6 billion or 30.6% of sales, an increase of 16 basis points from last year's first quarter. The most significant drivers were higher initial inventory markups and reduced transportation costs, partially attributable to lower fuel rates. This was in part offset by a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which have a lower gross profit rate than non-consumables, increased inventory shrink and higher markdown. SG&A expense decreased by 26 basis points over the 2015 quarter to $1.1 billion or 21.5% of sales in the first quarter. The majority of the SG&A decrease was due to lower utilities costs, administrative payroll, incentive compensation, travel expenses, workers' compensation costs and advertising costs as well as higher volume of customer cash-back transactions resulting in increased convenience fees paid to the company. Partially offsetting these items were our retail labor investments and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in sales. Our zero-based budgeting initiatives contributed to our robust results. This process leverages our cultural heritage of thrift and further solidifies our leadership as a low-cost operator. We implemented zero-based budgeting proactively and thoughtfully as we developed our fiscal 2016 budget using 3 filters : the customer, our strategic priorities and risk mitigation. The team is now actively working on a pipeline of additional future savings opportunities across the company. Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% as compared to 37.7% in the first quarter last year. As we detailed in our press release, the effective income tax rate was lower in the first quarter of this year due primarily to early adoption of amendment to existing guidance for employee share-based payment accounting and the recognition of incremental benefits from the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The income tax benefit of the employee share-based payment accounting change in the quarter was approximately $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Because the majority of our stock-based awards typically vest in the first quarter, we do not expect this accounting amendment impact to recur to this degree over the balance of the year. As you may recall, the WOTC was retroactively reenacted in the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in a significant portion of our 2015 annual benefit being recorded at that time. Due to Congress approving the WOTC through 2019, we will be able to recognize greater amounts of each quarter's benefit in the respective quarter in which it is earned. Now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.07 billion, up 8% in total and 2% on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with our sales growth. We generated cash from operations of $404 million in the quarter, an increase of 9% or $34 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $231 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding, totaling $71 million. From December 2011 through the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased $3.8 billion or 64.7 million shares of our common stock. As of the end of the first quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $693 million.  We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. In closing, we feel really good about delivering a strong first quarter. We remain committed to focusing on profitable growth, reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings through our zero-based budgeting program. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. Now let's turn to an update on our initiatives for 2016. Our customers are the starting point and center of all we do at Dollar General. We recently did the first recut of our consumer segmentation in 4 years to provide shopper insight that impact decisions across the entire company. This research helps us know who our customers are, where they shop, how they shop, what they buy, how much they spend, and most importantly, their attitudes and their behaviors. The exciting news is that we are improving our core customer productivity and retaining our trade-down customer, all while we expand our reach. New segments shopping with us include an older male middle income consumer and a millennial female shopper. The millennial shopper is a segment that I was particularly excited to see emerge as a core consumer for DG as this segment is so important to the future of retail and Dollar General. Today, she represents about 12% of our shoppers and 24% of our sales. On average, she is shopping our stores about 3 times a month. One of her money-saving strategies is to utilize technology like our Dollar General digital coupon app to make lists, find deals and save money. She wants healthy food items and likes to be on the cutting edge and try new products. While national brands are important, she also trusts our private brands. She utilizes the entire DG store as a way to stretch her budget. These insights will help us serve her even better going forward as we strive to ensure she becomes an even larger consumer segment for us over time.  I believe our deep and actionable understanding of our consumers is a core strength. As we implement and refine our initiatives, we have incorporated this knowledge of our consumers across merchandising and pricing, marketing, site selection and store operations and design. The primary goal is to grow transaction and item units, which continue to be key to our market share performance.  Our operating priorities continue to be, first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first priority is continuing to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips while capturing share with existing customers, the insights gained from our customer segmentation work are incorporated into our disciplined approach to category management. In the process, we have assessed the expansion of groups that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. In 2016, we are expanding perishables, health and beauty care, party and stationery. These 2016 sales-driving initiatives are being implemented across not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also into our mature store base at a greater degree than we have in the past several years. We are adding a total of 23,000 cooler doors across 9,000 existing stores. In the first quarter alone, more than 20% of these stores received a new cooler expansion, which allows for the extension of cold beer, more immediate consumption items and greater product selection. Additionally, more than 7,000 existing stores will see planogram expansions across health and beauty care, party and/or stationery, with many of these stores getting all expansions. Our ongoing affordability initiative is front and center with an expanded $1 offering, including a greater selection of national brands. Increased penetration of national brands at the $1 price point gives us the opportunity to increase trial with our consumers, which leads to brand acceptance. Acceptance drives loyalty, which tends to encourage trade-up over time. Currently, nearly 60% of our baskets contain a $1 item or less. Our private brand portfolio plays a key role in driving profitable sales as these items continue to both sales and enhance our gross margins. Private brands offer exceptional value to our core consumers and they offer lower opening price points, which is especially important to our customers. We continue to have private brand opportunity as our penetration is below both mass merchant and grocery segments. Our plans include engaging our store associates as private brand ambassadors. In addition, we will continue to communicate with our customers the unparalleled value our private brands offer. In the first quarter, we launched a new private brand line named Heartland Harvest to expand our better for you offerings, which really resonates with our millennials. By September, we anticipate over 15 new SKUs under this better for you brand. We will also be expanding our private brand offerings in health and beauty care. In about 160 Dollar General Plus locations, we are testing limited assortment of the best-selling fresh fruits and vegetables as we look to gain more experience in this category and capitalize on our customers' desire for fresh options. Our Fast Way to Save digital coupon offering continues to gain traction since we first brought this innovation to the channel in September of 2014. The program can provide consumers exclusive savings available only as Dollar General coupons. The compelling offers, which include national brands, private brands and instant savings, are helping to drive enrollment. We are seeing higher average basket and greater trip frequency for those enrolled in the program. A recent limited market test across about 300 stores captured 30,000 new enrollees in just 2 weeks. Additionally, we have made system changes that simplify enrollment. We are on track to more than double enrollment in the program by the end of this fiscal year, allowing for greater shopper analytics and targeting. The store operations team is aggressively improving our on-shelf availability. Across the board, we are seeing progress as our third-party audits indicate that our stores have improved their in-stock position by more than 100 basis points. In addition, we continue to optimize our labor investments in our more competitive markets and are pleased with the returns. Notably, these stores continue to show significant improvement in customer satisfaction metrics and same-store sales growth, along with operating profit gains. Across the chain, our customers are taking note of the improvement in in-stock position with recent customer satisfaction scores for our in-stock position at the highest level in 2 years. Our first quarter results indicate we are aggressively pursuing opportunities for continued gross margin expansion through global sourcing, cost management and supply chain efficiencies. We believe we will be able to improve both product quality and value for our customers over time. Second, we are focused on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth and a proven high return, low-risk model. Our long-term growth model contemplates 6% to 8% square footage growth annually. We anticipate accelerating our square footage growth in 2016 to about 7% with 900 new stores and increasing this to 7.5% in 2017 with about 1,000 new stores. Our new DG16 store layout is being used for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. We believe this layout can drive both existing and new store -- new consumer trips to Dollar General as we place a greater emphasis in the store on value, affordability and convenience. While it's still early, the results of this DG16 layout are encouraging. For instance, we're seeing stronger perishables sales, a double-digit lift in our new front-end items. Overall, our sales performance in stores using the DG16 layout is meeting our expectations. In addition, we are utilizing a smaller format store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. Currently, we have opened approximately 45 stores with selling square footage of less than 6,000 square feet, about 20% smaller than our traditional stores. Based on the early results, sales productivity and returns are very encouraging. This smaller footprint store has all of our strategic initiatives, but with added assortments. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our metro market consumers, we believe this smaller, more flexible format store will allow us to have a higher capture rate for site selection. Additionally, we believe this smaller format will work in rural locations with a lower household count. With this format, we have greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites. In total, we anticipate about 80 of the smaller format stores for the 2016 fiscal year. We have an active remodel and relocation program designed to keep our brand relevant as we utilize our most current store layout and in-store communication of value to drive same-store sales and returns. About 875 locations are expected to be relocated or remodeled in fiscal 2016 with around 900 locations slated for 2017. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017 as our 1,000-store pipeline is already 50% complete. We remain disciplined and focused on our new store program, continues to drive compelling returns with low cost to build and a low cost to operate. To support our new store growth and drive productivity, we are making investments in our distribution center network. Since 2012, we have opened 4 distribution centers. Construction is on track for our newest distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin, with a goal to begin shipping in early 2017. Most recently, we purchased land in Jackson, Georgia, for our 15th distribution center. In conjunction with the real estate team, we are proactively planning where our next distribution centers will be located to support growth across merchandising initiatives and store base. Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by our first quarter performance, our zero-based budgeting process contributed to our results as we successfully leveraged our SG&A expenses on same-store sales growth below our 2.5% to 3% leverage target. Our underlying principles are keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great on-boarding and training and open communication. We continue to make improvements as our store manager turnover decreased both sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015 and quarter-over-quarter. To build on these improvements going forward, we have focused on aligning our talent with the skill set required for success based on store characteristics in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover. Looking ahead, we are addressing the implementation of the Department of Labor's change to the overtime exemption regulations. We have been anticipating there would be changes since the proposed regulations were first announced and have been evaluating ways in which a change like this could be addressed once it was effective. Between now and the effective date of December 1, we will continue to refine our analysis and determine the course of action that best serves the needs of our employees, customers and shareholders. As for our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that it's always challenging for our core consumer, given the pressure on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are very pleased to have delivered a strong first quarter. The senior team is aligned and energized across merchandising, store operations and supply chain. Our multiyear strategic planning process is much further along than typical for this time of year, and we are optimistic and confident in our opportunities going forward. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and a competitive dividend.  Over the summer, we will celebrate a significant milestone with the opening of our 13,000th store location. With this type of new store growth, we continue to provide significant opportunities for our employees to develop their careers as we anticipate adding nearly 17,000 new jobs between 2016 and 2017. My appreciation and thanks goes out to the more than 115,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our customer with convenience, value and service every day. With that, Mary Winn, we'd like to now open the call for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you. Operator, we'll go ahead and start with the first question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : I guess, first, can you maybe quantify the potential impact from the recent minimum overtime ruling and how you can potentially mitigate that specifically? Todd Vasos : We are still evaluating right now all the different options. As you can imagine, we've been working very, very diligently over the course of the last few months in anticipation of the regulation. And now that we have the actual regulation, we're actually refining that so that we can insure that we, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, really take care of our employees, our customers and our shareholders alike. But the one good thing that you know about Dollar General, particularly, and retail in general is that we have a lot of levers at our disposal, Stephen, to really take a look at how we can mitigate a lot of what may be an expense here to us. But again, we're looking at it and we're going to do that exact right thing for our employees, customers and our shareholders. Stay tuned, we'll give you more clarity as we get a little closer to December 1. Stephen Grambling : Okay. And then, I guess, on the guidance, I know that you had said that the first quarter was supposed to be kind of the weakest growth rate of the year due to the comp comparison. Given the strong start to the year, should we be just assuming that you could be that much better in the back half given the cost control? John Garratt : Well, I'll start by saying we're very pleased indeed with the Q1 results as we delivered on all elements of the growth model. But bear in mind that growth model is a long-term model and what we're really focused on is putting the actions in place to drive that model for the long term, and we have a lot of great actions in place. We feel great about real estate. We're on track to open 900 units this year and over, as Todd mentioned, over 50% full the pipeline to open 1,000 next year. And the great thing here is the economics are as compelling as ever. We continue to see our IRRs exceed our 20% target, continue to see a payback less than 2 years. Sales are indexing above expectations. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, a lot of exciting things with sales comps in terms of product assortment, store formats, operating initiatives that will be fully -- many of them will be fully implemented as we get into the back half of the year and should gain momentum. And then on operating profit, as evidenced by the Q1 results, the team is very effectively managing all the levers to deliver that 42 basis points of expansion with growth in both gross margin and SG&A. And the newest lever, zero-based budgeting, we're really seeing that start to contribute very rapidly and really become ingrained in the fabric in which we operate here. And then lastly, we feel great about the amount of cash that this business continues to kick off, allowing us to reinvest in this low-risk, high-return new unit growth and the structure to support it, while continuing to pay a competitive, and over time, growing dividend as well as consistent robust share repurchases. So the model is working great. We think that's evidenced by the Q1 results and feel great about the long-term impact of this and the ability to continue improving it. Stephen Grambling : That's all very helpful. If I can sneak one other more specific one in there. Can you just help us size the global sourcing opportunity that you referenced in gross margin, maybe giving us a full bit of sense for what that percentage is now that's being sourced globally direct? And what kind of categories may be underpenetrated? Todd Vasos : Yes, when you look at it, Stephen, we still have a pretty large opportunity for our global sourcing efforts and we've been working very diligently over the last many years. We just opened our -- an office, a new office in Mainland China. We continue to open satellite offices, really, all over the globe, and the opportunity is still a very big. I could tell you that when we started this journey 8 years ago to really look at exactly how much opportunity we had, we always weighted that depending on also where the consumer was going. And we still think that the consumer is looking for national brands in a lot cases, but also great value in our private brand offerings, which really goes toward that -- goes toward that import piece. So we think we still have a tremendous amount opportunity, and we're working that each and every day overseas. And we feel very, very good about that as we go into the rest of this year and then into the long haul here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : Just circling back on the overtime rule change question. I guess, if you're giving a pay increase across your store manager base, we would get some back of the envelope math of about $90 million. I guess, just to size that up, is that where we are going to shake out? Or what specific moves would you be able to take to perhaps mitigate that impact as you look out to 2017? Todd Vasos : Yes, Peter, that's a great question. As we look at it, and we've done, as I indicated, many different scenarios, and I can tell you that none of those scenarios are even close to that $90 million, substantially less. And that's exactly what we're working on now is to get that impact down even further and looking at every lever that we have in our business to make sure we can lessen that impact. But we think it's much, much less than the number that you just indicated and with a big opportunity to lower it even further. The great thing about this business, we have a lot of flexibility. As John indicated, we're hitting on all of the elements of the growth model. And we feel that, in fact, as we look out longer term, we definitely have the ability to offset a lot of the pressure that this may put on that SG&A line. Peter Keith : Okay, very good. And then to be sticking on the SG&A topic. So the leverage was abnormally good in Q1. You've mentioned you kind of came in below your 2.5% to 3% leverage target. Were there some dynamics in Q1 that were abnormal or onetime in nature? Or are you perhaps going to see some continuation of this through the year? John Garratt : Well, I'll start by saying we feel great by the progress of zero-based budgeting thus far and we're very pleased to be able to leverage SG&A 26 basis points at that comp, which, yes, as you indicated, was even better than the 2.5% to 3% that we'd indicated previously, which had come down from the previous 3.5% level. With that said, there were some -- there was some timing in there, there was some benefit from mild weather that helped, but -- utilities. But all in all, we are off to a great start on zero-based budgeting. It's really taking hold, it's contributing very quickly, and I'll say it's also really becoming ingrained in the fabric of how we operate. And I see people of all levels of the organization now looking at everything they do through the lens of zero-based budgeting and the filters we've talked about, with the customer, our strategic priorities, risk management and looking at things in terms of return on investment. So I'd characterize it by very strong contribution from zero-based budgeting. We feel good of our ability to continue to leverage at the rates we've mentioned before going forward and feel the team is well on its way of building a pipeline of future savings to sustain at that. So we feel we're in a great spot on zero-based budgeting as evidenced by the results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : During the past year, Dollar General has successfully reduced shrink. At the Investor Day, you had called that out as one of the potential sources of gross margin rate going forward, but it sounds like shrink went in the wrong direction in the first quarter, and typically, that's never just a one-quarter event when you see that reversal in direction. Can you talk about what's changed with the shrink accrual? Todd Vasos : Yes. So as you look at shrink, and I do want to say, over the long haul, we feel good about where we're headed with shrink and all of the initiatives that we have in place to continue to reduce our shrink, and it is our #1 gross margin opportunity. In saying that, though, we did see a little bit of an uptick in Q1, and the majority of it was really due to our on-shelf availability efforts, to be honest with you. And we like the trade-off right now. We're not happy with it, we're looking at ways to mitigate that exposure on shrink. But what we felt that was even more compelling was to make sure that the customer, when they came in our store, had the product they needed on the shelf to purchase, and that was really the key driver. But rest assured that our operating team and our merchant marketing teams are working very, very hard, along with supply chain, to reduce that shrink number as we go forward. We still have a lot of levers to pull, still putting a lot of defensive merchandising tools and other tools for our district managers and our store managers to be able to monitor shrink even closer to the actual event. So we feel good about the long term, but still need to continue to work hard. And I dare to say that in the years to come, we'll always be talking about shrink, because that's just the nature of this business. Daniel Wewer : And this is a follow-up, back at the Investor Day, the long-term growth algorithm had a -- one scenario where same-store sales could be as strong as 4%. When you look at the timing of the market share initiatives revolving around the customer segmentation work, what is the realistic time frame from when that type of same-store sales growth could become visible? Is that a 2017 or a 2018 time line? Todd Vasos : Yes, Dan, when you -- when we looked and we put this algorithm together, we felt very confident over the long term that we could stay within those guardrails of 2% to 4%. And the initiatives that are just now rolling out in 2016, the majority of them are just now starting to roll out and will continue to roll out in Q2 and into Q3 and start to come to fruition even greater in the Q3 and Q4. And then as I indicated, we're further along on our strategic planning right now than we've been in the last 8 years here. And that gives me great solace that as we continue to move into '17 and beyond that there'll be a very robust initiative going forward to drive that top line. So we're very confident in the 2% to 4%. And there will be ebb and flow in there, but we feel that we have all the initiatives we need to make sure we deliver that. Daniel Wewer : I mean, do you think the current economic environment for your core customer is sufficient for Dollar General same-store sales to get in the, let's say, 3.5% to 4% rate? Or does some macro improvement, will that be needed to get to that kind of objective? Todd Vasos : Yes, when you look at our core consumer today, she's always under pressure as I indicated. Her income and her spending rates are usually under pressure. The great thing about our model is we do very well in either of those 2 scenarios, where she has a little bit more money, she spends a little bit more on those nonconsumable goods. And when she doesn't have as much, she may pull back there, but then utilizes us more on consumable and everyday staples that she knows she can get at an everyday low price. And the great thing that just came out of the segmentation work, Dan, that we're really encouraged about is this millennial shopper that's already making up about 24% of our sales line. And as we continue to learn more about her over time and be able to service her better, we, again, feel confident on that sales line and be able to deliver that as we move forward. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : It was mentioned that the weather provided a benefit to the expense line during the quarter. Do you think that the weather provided a benefit to the sales line as well? Maybe you could just talk about the flow of the quarter, given all the noise and volatility that we've heard out there. Todd Vasos : Yes, the cadence of the quarter really worked exactly like we thought it was going to work. With the shift of Easter into the second period March out of the third, which was April last year, obviously, March was a better month than April. And -- but when you looked at February, March and April combined, the cadence was exactly the way we had anticipated it coming into the fiscal year. So while there's always weather and different phenomenons that happen, we've got a lot of great initiatives here to continue to try to ensure that we capitalize on whatever those phenomenons are, and we felt that we did a pretty good job here in Q1. Michael Lasser : And Todd, as my follow-up, Walmart talked about beginning to implement its price investments, and that's going to accelerate over the course of the year. So what have you seen in the marketplace as far as pricing and promotions? And how are you prepared to respond? Todd Vasos : So as we look at pricing overall, macro, so taking into account mass, grocery and drug, we see still a very rational pricing that's happening in the marketplace today. In saying that, there's always retailers that at times will try different things. But the one great thing about our robust pricing model that we have here, we check prices every 2 weeks on our top items. And we also, every quarter, check it on the full book so we know exactly where we stand. And we, today, feel very confident in the where we sit on pricing, and if we see folks moving, you'll see us move because this is all about ensuring that we continue to drive units out of our stores, and of course, drive traffic into our stores. So anywhere that we may see where we need to be sharper on price, we'll take that action. and the great thing about Dollar General is, again, we've got the levers to enable us to do that. And so when we look at this, we also look at it from the standpoint that our vendors help us a lot as well. We're in the top 10 of all CPG companies out there, and quite frankly, we're in the top 5 of the majority of them. And that gives us great partnership with our vendor community that enables us to insure we're right priced any time we need to be. Michael Lasser : Just to clarify that thought. Does that mean you haven't seen any major changes? And if, do you think you'll get support to match those changes from the vendor community? Todd Vasos : I didn't say we didn't see anything. I did say that we have taken -- we will continue to take appropriate action when we do see it, and rest assured we have and will continue to do that if we see any retailer moving on price that we feel that our consumer, because she looks to us to be a leader there as well, and we'll make sure we do everything we have to do to get keeping units moving through the box. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Daniel Binder : It's Dan Binder. I had a couple of questions on -- first, on the labor investment that you've been making all through last year. Is that -- do you feel like you're getting that payback in comps across all of the different phases that you rolled out last year? And is there any more color you can put on how that comp differential looks versus the rest of the base? And then lastly, if there are more stores identified to get that labor investment? Todd Vasos : Yes, Dan, we watch this very closely. And as you know, Dollar General pretty well, we don't do anything that doesn't have a return attached to it. And we don't just shelf it after we roll it out, we really monitor and watch. So what I could tell you is that we're very pleased on all levels from our price or -- excuse me, our labor investments into these stores. Now over the time, we have, over the course of the last few months, we've taken some stores off of that and we've added additional new stores onto it depending on those returns. And we'll continue to do that, so we'll always continue to add new stores if we see the need and the benefit that will be there. But we also will take stores off if we see that the benefit is not meeting or exceeding our expectations or they don't need it any longer for whatever other reason. But we continue to really like what we see here and looking at ways we can continue to expand that as we go forward. Daniel Binder : And just one other question on the small formats. As you look out to markets that support it, what do you think the small format opportunity looks like longer term? And when you look at your broader store expansion plans, how many markets do you look at as effectively one-store markets, where there'd be room for, essentially, Dollar General and nobody else given the size? Todd Vasos : Yes. So we've -- this is really new for us still, right. We've got 45 stores up and running. We've got approximately 80 planned in total to be opened by the end of the fiscal year. And so as you can imagine, we are out looking now on, because we're very happy with what we see so far, is where those next stores will be as we go into '17 and beyond. But again, because of the nature of it, one being in these more metropolitan type areas, and then secondly, in these very rural areas, we got our arms around pretty close about how big that is. We're not really going to say exactly how big it is, because what we're doing is making sure that we can refine the model appropriately with, again, only 45 open, but we've got a good idea. The important thing here is we are concentrating a lot, though, in those rural areas, where there is only room for one store. And that's why you see us moving very quickly in a lot of cases with our growth of 900 stores this year and up to 1,000 next year. And a lot of those areas are in these towns or even crossroads that can only support one retailer. And I sure would rather it be Dollar General and that's how we're going about this. So we're moving pretty quickly there and feel good about where that pipeline is for 2017 already. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse. Edward Kelly : So I just have a follow-up for you on the rate [indiscernible] and I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is how do we think about cost leverage point as we make it through at the end of the year? And do you think you'll be able to achieve 2.5% to 3% target despite this? Or should we plan for some temporary pressure as we think about our model? Mary Winn Pilkington : Ed, it's Mary Winn. We had a real hard time understanding your question. Do you mind repeating that? Edward Kelly : Yes. Sorry about that. I just have a question, a follow-up question on the rate structure. And my question is as this headwind grows sort of at the end of the year, how do we think about your ability to achieve the 2.5% to 3% leverage point? Is that something that you're going to be able -- do you think you're going to be able to manage through as we look at next year? Or as we think about our model, should we be planning on some type of temporary pressure, even if it's not usually material? John Garratt : Yes, what I would say is that in terms of the FLSA, that's new breaking news, but conversely, we had the tax benefit that wasn't contemplated when we spoke with you last. So we continually have puts and takes. And I point back to the number of levers we have to -- and the track record we have of successfully managing through and mitigating the various puts and takes as we move through. Edward Kelly : Okay. And then just maybe one quick follow up for you. Can you just maybe give us a little insight in terms of what you're seeing from the consumer at this point? We've seen that at Walmart, that -- you know the big box stock trip seems to be doing okay, but others have complained around fill ins. Just your general thoughts about what you're seeing out there today in your business from a traffic standpoint. Todd Vasos : Yes. When you look at it, the consumer is probably about the same as they were coming out of Q4, to be honest with you. We're seeing about the same trends. There was no doubt that she is still watching what she spends. But again, that's the nature of our core consumer, and she is always looking for the ability to make sure she can deliver to her family at the lowest price. And so that's what we're concentrated on mainly is to ensure that we've got the right item at the right price at the right time for her, and we've been delivering that. But the consumer right now, overall, I would tell you, back to work for the most part, probably feeling a little bit more confident, but -- and spending at little bit more on her nonconsumables, and we're still seeing our nonconsumable growth but still being cautious. So we look at that as an opportunity for us, especially for fill in. Because if she is cautious, that stock-up trip is not always in her eyesight, if you will, and at times, she maybe a little bit more reticent to stock up and a little bit free-er to fill in. And again, with our offering and our prices, we offer a compelling reason to come to Dollar General when she does that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vinny Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : I wanted to go to the zero-based budgeting. You guys mentioned that you are certainly starting to see some nice traction so far. Could you give us all maybe just a bit more color in terms of kind of the bigger learnings thus far, where the opportunities have come from? Then I think, John, you mentioned kind of seeing more opportunities going forward. If you can give us a little more sense around that? John Garratt : Sure. I think, one of the biggest learnings is just the additive effect it has is really people embraced this mentality. I think we've got everybody very thoughtfully looking at everything they do. They're spending through those filters of the customer of the strategic priorities of risk mitigation. It really focuses our efforts and focuses our resources towards the highest returning mission-critical activities. And there's a lot of power to that and it really has a compounding effect. In addition, we have teams, we have 23 different cost packages, teams, with senior-level folks on the teams, cross-functional engagement, interaction. And we have a pretty rigorous routine now; monthly meetings with the senior leadership team, where we go deep and wide through all the costs. And with that increased learning, with that sharing across the company, it really drives best practices that feeds on itself. And we're going after costs. In process improvement, we're going after costs. In efficiencies, we're going after costs in just good old-fashioned prioritization of spending, working very closely with procurement to go deeper and wider on those activities. So it really cuts across the entire P&L. It really is the power of the teams working together to uncover. We've always had good cost management here and it's been a strength of ours, but with this zero-based budgeting, it really allows us to go that layer deeper to get those costs on the baseline that are hard to bring out and really drive an ownership type of mentality where it's not a use it, lose it budget that rolls ever but really everything has to pay for itself. Vincent Sinisi : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just one quick follow-up. You mentioned quite a bit about the different categories expansions, including a private-label testing, some more perishables. How should we think about, like, is there anything notable in terms of an overall assortment standpoint, in terms of some of these new things that are going in? Is anything notable coming out? How you're shifting the shelves around? Anything to call out there? Todd Vasos : When we -- the nice thing about Dollar General and our category management system that we put together years ago, we have a very robust category management process that looks at each year every single category and then every item -- with only 10,000 SKUs, it's a little easier, every item within those categories, and we adjust each and every year, depending on the -- where the consumer is going, whether it's her economic condition or her attitude and how she feels about her economic condition. We're able to move left and right, if you will. Now in saying that, at times, we do need reduce items inside of our store and reduce square footage on some categories and then increase others. So this time, this year, we really worked hard to increase our perishables, our health and beauty areas, our party and stationery areas. And in many cases, a lot of the reductions were coming out of a mix of both consumable and nonconsumable areas. I think I gave an example before, but right now, the -- a lot of the dry cereal business is in a secular decline. So what we do there is we reduce some square footage so we can increase square footage of other dry grocery areas. So we're very attuned to what is happening in the marketplace, and the great thing about us is we're very nimble and we're able to take advantage of that very quickly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Alvin Concepcion : I'm wondering if you could talk about second quarter same-store sales trends today. It sounds like there was a lot of noise in April with Easter shift and weather, so I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of how things are currently working. And related to that, I think you've previously expressed confidence that you can accelerate comps to the 3% range for the year. Is that still your view? Todd Vasos : Again, when you look at it, the quarter ended up exactly the way we thought it would from a shape perspective, exactly the way we planned it. And again, we really feel confident long term, and we look at this long term, that in fact we have the initiatives in place and we have the strategic planning already moving forward to ensure that we can keep those comps moving as we go through this year and in the years to come. So again, we're confident in that 2% to 4%, that guard rail that we've put up, and we want to just continue to move through that. Alvin Concepcion : Very good. And then unrelated to this, I'm wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the produce test in 160 locations, just some more color on the strategy there? Wondering if you can give us a sense to the price points relative to discounters or even conventional grocery? And if you could, I mean, what kind of margin profile did you construct for that relative to the overall consumables category? Todd Vasos : Yes, so when we look at it, keep in mind, today, we've got fresh fruits and vegetables in about 160 of our market stores today. And so we've been in this business for a while. We understand it. We know what the sales and margin levers look like there. In these stores that we're talking about, these 160 or so, and we internally call them Dollar General Plus stores because they have a larger expansion on coolers, on perishables already, but now the introduction of fresh fruits and vegetables will be a nice addition. But keep in mind, this will be just limited amount of SKUs. So this will not be like a market store, where we have a lot of different SKUs. This will be a core 10, 12-item type of an arrangement right now, where some of the basics, right, apples, bananas, oranges, onions, tomatoes, those types of things. But really, what [Audio Gap] to do is address what that consumer is looking for. They're looking for fresh opportunities. And for us to be able to give her that at a very convenient time in her shop, and again, we're very convenient based, we think it's the right thing and we're able to leverage our market stores and the cost profile we have from those stores into these. So we feel good about the where our costs will be, retails will be and what our profitability will be on that. It will be a small piece of the business, though. This is not meant to be a big driver of sales, but it's meant to be a driver of traffic. Mary Winn Pilkington : So we've hit the top of the hour, so I think we're going to end the call now. But thank you very much for your interest in Dollar General. Both Matt and I will be around to handle any calls, so just please -- looking forward to see you soon, and thank you for your interest. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Hope, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, August 25, 2016. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Hope, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and John Garratt, our CFO.

Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call, except as may be otherwise required by law or as described under the heading, Financial Outlook Set Forth In Our Earnings Press Release Issued Today. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Mary Winn, and welcome to everyone joining our call. For the second quarter, we are pleased with our double-digit earnings per share growth even as our same-store sales performance fell short of our expectations. I'm particularly proud of the team's ability to effectively manage our gross profit margin and leveraging our selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of sales in what proved to be a difficult sales environment. Key factors that negatively impacted our expected same-store sales performance included a greater-than-anticipated headwind from price deflation across key perishable items, with retail prices down about 8% for milk and over 50% for eggs, our 2 largest products within perishables; second, a reduction in both SNAP participation rates and benefit levels; third, an unseasonably mild spring; and lastly, an intensified promotional environment in select regions of the country. We estimate that the headwinds from price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the second quarter by approximately 60 to 70 basis points. As you will -- as I will discuss in more detail later in the call, we are taking aggressive action across merchandising and store operations to address these factors and help drive same-store sales, and we will continue to be very disciplined in our SG&A spending. I'm pleased with our overall financial performance and the team's ongoing focus on our long-term strategy despite the challenging retail environment. Highlights of the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the prior year's second quarter include : net sales increased 5.8% to $5.4 billion, and same-store sales grew at 0.7%. Same-store sales growth was positive for consumables, offset by a decline in nonconsumable category. Gross margin was 31.2%, an increase of 2 basis points. We leveraged selling, general and administrative expenses by 8 basis points as our zero-based budgeting initiatives continue to contribute to our results. Operating profit increased 7%, with operating profit margin expansion of 10 basis points. Net income in the second quarter increased 9% to $307 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.08. Year-to-date through the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was 18%. Cash from operations increased 36% year-to-date through the second quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $294 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. We continued to grow market share as reported in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced relatively consistent low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. Now I'll turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the 2016 second quarter was $1.7 billion or 31.2% of sales, an increase of 2 basis points from last year's second quarter. As compared to the prior year's second quarter, higher additional markups on inventory purchases and lower transportation costs contributed to the gross profit rate increase, offset by higher markdowns, a greater proportion of sales growth in consumables, which carries a lower margin than nonconsumables and higher inventory shrink. SG&A expense decreased by 8 basis points over the 2015 quarter to $1.2 billion or 21.7% of sales in the second quarter. The majority of the SG&A percentage decrease was due to reductions in administrative payroll costs, advertising costs and incentive compensation expenses. Partially offsetting these items were our retail, labor and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales.  Similar to last quarter, our zero-based budgeting initiatives were a key driver of our SG&A performance. The team continues to actively work on a pipeline of additional future savings opportunities across the company, leveraging process improvement, procurement and prioritization to remove costs that don't affect the customer experience.  Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% as compared to 38% in the second quarter last year. As in the first quarter, our effective tax rate was lower this quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter, primarily due to the recognition of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit in the quarter in which it is earned, given changes by Congress in December 2015. Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. Merchandise inventories at second quarter end were $3.27 billion. For the quarter, total inventory was up 8% and 1.6% on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth, in line with our sales growth. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we generated cash from operations of $793 million, an increase of 36% or $208 million compared to the 2015 second quarter as a result of both higher net income and working capital improvements. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $224 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding, totaling $71 million. Year-to-date through the end of the second quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $597 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividends. From December 2011 through the second quarter of 2016, we repurchased $4 billion or 67.3 million shares of our common stock. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization of $1 billion, we currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $1.4 billion under the repurchase program. We are pleased to note that, during the second quarter, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to Baa2. In mid-August, we implemented a commercial paper program with the goal to reduce our short-term borrowing rate as commercial paper rates are typically lower than rates under a revolver facility. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Looking ahead, items to keep in mind that will impact our results during the second half of the year include the purchase of 42 former Walmart Express locations, the implementation of the Department of Labor changes to the overtime exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the calendar shifts between the third and fourth quarters of this year. As we look to relocate 40 Dollar General locations into these purchase sites, we anticipate taking a charge in the 2016 third quarter of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share, primarily related to closed store lease obligations.  For the FLSA implementation, we continue to prepare for the changes, which are effective December 1 of this year, by gaining experience with various test-and-learn scenarios. We anticipate the incremental expense will be about $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter this year. Please keep in mind this is a higher run rate in fiscal 2016 than we would expect next year due to the 53rd week in the fourth quarter this year and because certain initiatives intended to offset the incremental impact will not be in place until next year. Due to the calendar shifts, year-over-year, between the third and fourth quarter, our third quarter 2016 will be negatively impacted by the shift of 2 selling days, prior to Halloween, along with the timing of a key payday into the fourth quarter 2016 as compared to being included in the third quarter of last year. Turning to our outlook. Recall that we stated that we intend to update our diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2016 only if we no longer reasonably expect diluted EPS to fall within the 10% to 15% range, outlined in the model included in our press release issued on March 10, 2016. We continue to forecast diluted EPS for fiscal 2016 within this range of 10% to 15%. Please keep in mind that the investments we are making across merchandising and store operations will take time to gain traction with our consumers. We remain committed to focusing on the long-term profitable growth, reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings through our zero-based budgeting program. We are investing in initiatives intended to drive same-store sales and build loyalty across our consumer base, with prices that they trust from us. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. We have a track record of strong financial results and the team is taking steps designed to improve our sales performance, but it will take time for our initiatives to resonate with our consumer. As we have said consistently, we are committed to increasing market share by growing both item units and traffic, and we will invest, as we deem appropriate, to meet this objective. To that end, we are making aggressive pricing, labor and marketing investments in designated market areas that we see as opportunities to be proactive as we look to improve same-store sales and market share, all while providing our consumers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most. Our focus is on the consumable categories to drive traffic and units. For example, we have taken retail price reductions on average of 10% on about 450 of our best-selling SKUs across 2,200 stores, representing nearly 17% of our store base. We believe that these price reductions are meaningful and recognizable to our consumers. We are committed to further price moves, as appropriate, over time. We are being strategic as we look to proactively address our pricing actions across our store base. These targeted price investments are in high household penetration, fast-turning categories. At the same time, we are investing and communicating these price breaks to our consumers through incremental store signage, ad circulars, digital coupons, e-mail and digital media. While it is still very early in making these investments, the results are on track with where we would like for the performance to be on increasing units and traffic. We will continue to monitor our pricing actions and assess the opportunity for ongoing preemptive moves to enhance our competitive positioning. We anticipate refreshing these price investments across items and categories, as well as incremental markets, as needed, as we move through the coming quarters with the goal to drive traffic and units and capture additional market share. As for our core consumer, we operate with the reality that it is always challenging for her to stretch her budget, given the pressures on her income and spending. We have seen an ongoing contraction in core consumer all-outlet retail spending, as reflected in the Nielsen panel data. Given that our core consumer skews toward a lower income household, I believe the cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors, such as a reduction in SNAP participation and benefit levels and increased housing and health care expenses are taking a noticeable toll on her spending. Our goal is to be there for our customers when they need us the most. We will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. We remain committed to our long-term operating priorities : first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. Over the long term, we believe our pricing, labor and marketing investments will pay off in trips and units through increased customer loyalty. As we work through our category management process for 2016, we assessed the expansion of product groups that were most likely to drive traffic in our stores. Through the first half of 2016, we have made great progress on expanding space allocation for perishables, health and beauty care, and party and stationery. These 2016 sales-driving initiatives are being implemented across not just new stores, relocations and remodels but also in our mature store base to a greater degree than in the last several years. Implementation of these initiatives will be completed in the third quarter. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have added nearly 21,000 cooler doors to our mature stores to allow for an expanded offering of cold beer, more immediate consumption items and greater product selection. Additionally, more than 7,000 existing stores have seen planogram expansions across health and beauty care, party and/or stationery, with many of these stores receiving expansions in each of these product areas. This initiative was completed in the second quarter of this year.  Our ongoing affordability initiative is front and center with an expanded $1 offering, including a greater selection of national brands. Increased penetration of national brands at the $1 price point gives us the opportunity to increase trial with our consumers, which leads to brand acceptance. Acceptance drives loyalty, which tends to encourage trade-up in package size and brands over time. Currently, nearly 49% of our baskets contain a $1 item. In our new DG16 format, these baskets are nearly $3 higher than our average basket, indicating these are incremental purchases. Our private brand portfolio plays a key role in driving profitable sales growth as these items contribute to sales and enhance gross margins. Our consumers rely on the quality, value and affordability of our private brands. Our private brands offer exceptional value to our core consumers and they offer lower opening price points, which is especially important to our consumers. We continue to have private brand opportunity as our customer penetration is below the average in the mass merchant and grocery segments. We are actively engaging our store associates as private brand ambassadors. In addition, we will continue to communicate with our consumers the unparalleled value our private brands offer. In the first quarter, we launched a new private line named Heartland Harvest, to expand our better-for-you offerings, which really resonate with our millennials. By next month, we anticipate offering over 15 new SKUs under this better-for-you brand. This year, we have also expanded our private brand offerings in health and beauty care. In select Dollar General Plus locations, we initiated a test of limited assortments of the industry's best-selling fresh fruits and vegetables as we look to gain more experience with these products and capitalize on our consumers' continued desire for fresh options. So far, we are pleased with the early results. Our Fast Way to Save digital coupon offering continues to gain traction since we first brought this innovation to the channel in September of 2014. We are on track to more than double enrollment in the program by the end of this fiscal year, allowing for greater shopper analytics and targeting of coupons. The program provides consumers exclusive savings available only as DG Digital Coupons. The compelling offerings, which include national brands, private brands and instant savings, are helping to drive enrollment. Importantly, we are seeing a higher average basket when the DG digital coupons are utilized. The store operations team is aggressively improving our on-shelf availability. Across the board, we are seeing progress, as our third-party audits indicate that our stores have reduced their core out-of-stocks by more than 20%. Throughout the chain, our consumers are taking note of our improved in-stock position with recent customer satisfaction scores for our in-stock position at the highest level in 2 years based on comparable quarters. In addition, we continue to optimize our labor investments in our more competitive markets and are pleased with the comp sales performance, operating profit gains and customer satisfaction scores. Second, we're focused on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth for -- with a proven high-return, low-risk model. As we previously announced, we are on track to accelerate our square footage growth in 2016 to about 7% with 900 new stores and increase this growth to 7.5% in 2017 with about 1,000 new stores. We continue to be very pleased with the strong results that we have gained through this program. Our new store productivity remains in the range of 80% to 85% of our comp store base, all while driving returns of 20% plus.  Our new DG16 store layout is being used for all new stores, relocations and remodels. Through the second quarter, the team has already completed nearly 1,100 real estate projects in this new layout. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. We believe this layout can drive both existing and new consumer trips to Dollar General as we place an even greater emphasis in the store on value, affordability and convenience.  The early results of this DG16 layout are encouraging. For instance, we are seeing stronger perishable sales and a double-digit lift in our new front-end items. Overall, sales performance in stores using the DG16 layout is exceeding our expectations. Even more importantly, our customers are telling us they like it as our customer satisfaction scores are significantly higher for the DG16 layout. In addition, we are utilizing a smaller footprint store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. To date, we are currently operating more than 80 of these new stores, with selling space of less than 6,000 square feet, about 20% smaller than our traditional store. Based on the early results, sales productivity and returns of the small-format stores are very encouraging. This store footprint incorporates all of our strategic initiatives, but with edited assortments. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our metro market consumers, we believe this smaller, more flexible format store will allow us to have a higher capture rate for site selection.  We anticipate that this smaller format will work in rural locations with a lower household count as well. With this format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower-household rural sites. In total, we anticipate we will have approximately 120 of the smaller format stores, including remodels, open as we exit the 2016 fiscal year. In July, we announced the purchase of former Walmart Express locations that we intend to have operating as Dollar General stores by the end of October. 40 of the 42 sites will be considered relocations of existing stores. Each of these locations will have fresh meat and produce, and 38 will have fueling stations. The team is moving very fast to get these locations up and running to better serve these communities with the everyday low prices and convenience our customers count on from us. We have an active remodel and relocation program designed to keep our brands relevant as we utilize our most current store layout and in-store communication of value to drive same-store sales and returns. About 900 locations are expected to be relocated or remodeled in fiscal 2016 with a similar level of product -- projects slated for fiscal 2017.  We anticipate expanding our footprint in 2017 into North Dakota, representing our 44th state of operations. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017, as our 1,000 store pipeline is already over 80% complete. We remain disciplined and focused as our new store program continues to drive compelling returns with a low cost to build and a low cost to operate.  Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by our second quarter performance, our zero-based budgeting process is working as we successfully leveraged our SG&A expenses on same-store sales growth significantly below our 2.5% to 3% SG&A leverage target. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication. We continue to make improvements in our store manager turnover and are on track to have our best retention rate in several years. To build on these improvements going forward, we have been focused on aligning our talent with the skill set required for success based on store characteristics to -- in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate retention. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are clearly focused on providing our customers with value and convenience in the current environment as our customers need us more than ever to help stretch her household spending.  Earlier this month, we had over 1,000 field leaders together in Nashville to discuss our plans for the future. As I engaged with the team, it was clear to me they are energized and excited about our plans. We are acting with a sense of urgency across merchandising, store operations and supply chain. Our long-term commitment to growth in shareholder value is unchanged. I believe we are well positioned for the future and are focused on capturing the long-term opportunities ahead of us. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in new store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and a competitive dividend. To the more than 119,000 Dollar General employees across our 13,000 store locations, distribution centers and store support center that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our consumers with convenience, value and service every day, please accept my thanks and appreciation for all that you do as we gear up for the holiday selling season. With that, Mary Winn, we'd now like to turn the call open for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Sounds great. Hope, we'll take the first question, please. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : So how did you come up with the 10% cut in price as well as the number of items? How do you think about elasticity at that level, right, in terms of kind of getting a payback? And then are there other items -- when you think about funding that, are there other items, be it consumable or discretionary, where maybe they're less so visible and prices go up, and that's partly a way to fund it? Todd Vasos : Yes, John, as you know, we're very focused on price here at Dollar General. For our core consumer, price is everything, along with the convenience factor that we offer. And you also know from us that we don't do anything without fully testing it first. We've had tests in place in a couple hundred stores for a very long time with a subset of these 450 items and, in some cases, as much as 500 items depending on the stores. So we well tested these, and know that these are the items that will actually drive additional foot traffic into our stores. But more importantly, will give the value to our consumer that she needs in a very tough time. And then lastly, what we see by these items, it helps round out that basket with the nonconsumables once she gets in the store and we get her to pick up the consumables, that basket rounds out pretty nicely because of our compelling nonconsumable offering. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then, secondly, so you talked about the Walmart Expresses and having fresh meat and produce, so where does that take you going forward? You're already testing produce in some of the DGs. And do the DGs -- more into DG market, is DG market kind of dead as a growth vehicle? Or does that come back at some point where you could actually expand that more aggressively? Todd Vasos : Yes, as you look at retail, in general, it's dynamic, right? And the great thing here at Dollar General is that we're very flexible, and we look at every way we can to maximize our opportunities that lie out there, at the same time, in making sure that we service our consumers the way they need to be serviced in certain demographics and areas of the country. In saying that, we see an opportunity, especially with our millennial group, but even our core customer on some more fresh opportunities and offerings for her, not only in fruits and vegetables, some fresh meats, that makes sense, but also, as I indicated, in some of our better-for-you lines that we're now starting to put out. Our core consumer is starting to gravitate to that, and our next level up, our \"Best Friends Forever\" group in that millennial segment really resonate with it. So I think this is a springboard, quite frankly, in the more to come as we look to what Dollar General store -- our basic Dollar General store looks like in the future. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So, I mean, the elephant in the room, obviously, Walmart's investing in price. We were down in North Carolina, and we actually didn't see your price investments that you're referencing. We saw about a 13% gap in price between DG and Walmart. So I guess the question is what's the appropriate gap for you guys? And if Walmart continues on their path and now we've seen Delhaize follow suit and it will, obviously, up their consumable -- aggressiveness in consumables. Target has referenced it. We have Albertsons-Safeway being pretty aggressive in certain markets. I guess take me forward in how you see this rolling through DG's numbers, how it ends well for most people that are selling consumables, because everyone is saying the same thing, \"We got to get aggressive. We got to drive the traffic.\" But it seems like we're just descending into a price war. Todd Vasos : Yes, the way we look at this is we look at it a little differently in that, first of all, the retail landscape is very aggressive right now. There is no doubt about it. But you know what? Retail is always aggressive, and there's always folks doing different things, and we compete and have competed for many, many years with many retailers. In saying that, the way we look at this is being proactive. So what we are looking at in our 2,200 stores that we've reduced prices on average of 10%, what we have done is a proactive approach to it, not necessarily chasing anybody but, actually, putting price where we believe will best serve our consumer and best be able to capture market share. And as we continue to move forward and expand that, whether it be other markets and/or other items, we'll take that same tack on being proactive and not reactive. Because you're right, if everyone is reactive then, in fact, sometimes, it doesn't end well. Lastly, the great thing about Dollar General is that we have the wherewithal to do this. We have the wherewithal to do it within our P&L and others may or may not have that same luxury. So we see it as a real advantage for Dollar General. But we see it mostly as being there for our core consumer because she needs us the most right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : So I believe a quarter ago, as we thought about the full year guidance, it was indicated to be towards the higher end of the range, whereas today, I think it's just more kind of within the range. Is it just the adjustments from the labor expense being added into the fourth quarter and the kind of bad rent [ph] and expenses associated with the stores that you acquired or maybe you can just walk us through other puts and takes as we think about the full year? In particular, what is the comp guidance for the second half? Todd Vasos : Sure, Paul. And I'll reiterate what we said at the beginning of the call is that -- and we've stated this previously and it was in our earnings release that we were talking to the 10% to 15% range, and are still forecasting to be within that range for full year EPS, but not otherwise updating any specific aspects of the guidance today, but -- and what I also want to reiterate is that this team has a strong track record of managing all the business levers to deliver profit and cash growth and feel good about the first half performance at 14 -- 18% year-to-date EPS growth and 14% in Q2 as well as the strong cash growth. But what I will tell you is that we have headwinds in the second half. We mentioned the charge associated with the 42 newly acquired stores. That will be about $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share impact. We also have the implementation of FLSA, which is about $0.03 to $0.04 impact in Q4. And I think it's important to note there that even though that's only over 2 months, you can't extrapolate that over the course of next year, given that we have a 53rd week in -- at the end of the year as well as many of the actions that help mitigate that cost next year won't be fully implemented until next year. But those 2 will have impacts on the balance of the year. And then again, bear in mind, we're focused on the long term here and making the right decision to be there for our customer when she needs us the most and, with an eye on the long term, are making investments that we talked about earlier in the call. But again, the business fundamentals, I will stress, remain unchanged with -- we're very excited about opening 900 new units this year, on track for 1,000 next year. As Todd mentioned, pipeline is 80% full, and we're still seeing the same compelling great unit level economics since we opened the stores with the same productivity and the same great returns over 20%. Paul Trussell : Okay, I guess, just going back to the comp, just wanted to -- so no guidance in terms of the comp over the balance of the year. Could you maybe just speak to the cadence of comps during the second quarter and the impact that you mentioned of 60 to 70 basis points from deflation and SNAP. Do you expect that -- a similar impact to be ongoing? Todd Vasos : Yes, Paul. I would tell you that all periods in the second quarter were positive. So we're very happy to have seen that. As I look forward to the back half of the year, I believe many, if not, most all of the same headwinds we saw in the sales line continue to be there in the back half of the year. Deflation, as well as SNAP, that 60 to 70 basis points -- the headwind that is not going to go away. Now trying to counter that obviously will be our price investments. Now as you know, though, price investments take time to resonate with the consumer. And while we're very, very confident that it will drive units and traffic, it'll take a little time for that initiative to take hold. So we're doing everything possible here to ensure that we're giving the consumer the deal that she needs, so that we can continue to have her come into our store and for us to continue to capture market share. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James & Associates. Daniel Wewer : Todd, I wanted to ask about the payback from the -- I think, it was 21,000 coolers that you've added to mature stores. And to whether or not whether you're seeing any diminishing returns from the additional coolers, and perhaps, you could peg that to your experience with the DG Plus cooler set? Todd Vasos : Yes. That's a great question. Everything we do here has a return attached to it and the cooler program is no different. We track it each and every week because it is a big initiative for us. Those 21,000, 22,000 cooler doors that we have put in are doing exactly what we had thought they would do, and actually, in many cases, exceeding our expectations. But because of the headwinds we're seeing and deflation, mainly in those perishable categories of milk and eggs, it's diluting that -- those effects a little bit. But I could tell you, for the long term, and that's how we look at this business for the long term, it is the exact right thing to do. And we're confident in that because, and you mentioned it, our Dollar General Plus and market stores, these are just segments that were already proven in those stores to be very successful that we've moved into our traditional stores. So we're very confident over time that those will pay big dividends to us. Daniel Wewer : And just one other follow-up. The drop in customer transactions per store, I believe that's the first time that's happened since the buyout back in 2008. Where do you think that, that business shifted? Is it -- was it to the mass merchants and, perhaps, they're able to take advantage of the lower gasoline pricing and their customers becoming more mobile as a result? Todd Vasos : When we look at it, the headwind of SNAP for us really was a big deal. And also, our core consumer continues to be under a lot of pressure. I know that when we look at, globally, the overall U.S. population, it's seemingly -- it seems like things are getting better. But when you really start breaking it down and you look at that core consumer that we serve on the lower economic scale that's out there, that demographic, things have not gotten any better for her, and arguably, they're worse. And they're worse because rents are accelerating. Health care is accelerating on her at a very, very rapid clip. And now you couple that in upwards of 20 states where they have reduced or eliminated the SNAP benefit, and it has really put a toll on her. That SNAP benefit reduction and/or elimination happened in April, right? That was the kickoff, and you could see it immediately in the numbers. So I believe that those are the things that are affecting her today, again, our core customer. And by the way, we've seen this play out before. If you dial the clock back to October of '13 and coming into November of 2013 when the last large SNAP benefit reduction happened, it happened almost exactly the same way on our comps and how we saw traffic. Obviously, we were up at a little higher level at that time, but rest assured that our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar as it did now. The difference here is we're going to take aggressive price action to get that consumer back in the store. She needs a little motivation to get back in. We need to help her stretch her budget for a time period until she figures it out. Our core customer's very resilient. They'll figure it out over time, but they need a little help as they tend to now try to figure out how to make ends meet with less money during the month. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : Was curious on the price investment. I presume that it's probably going to expand to more stores than the base, I think, you said 17%. How should we think about that dynamic on gross margin, going forward? John Garratt : Expansion that -- well, that's -- with the pricing, that's something that we are assessing as we go. And as Todd mentioned previously, we test and learn with everything that we do, and we are seeing benefits from the pricing actions that we have taken. Bear in mind that this does take time to fully take traction with our consumers. So really, we'll control what we can control, monitor the environment and take pricing on an as-needed basis to make sure we're there for our customer when she needs us, and to make sure we're making the right decision for the long-term health of the business. Now that will, of course, have an impact on margin as we do that. But again, we're focused on the long-term payback from that. Peter Keith : Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up question on the discretionary categories. So it looked like home and basic clothing were 2 areas of weakness, and those had been historically a little bit better. I wouldn't think those were impacted by the spring dynamic. So maybe could you comment on what's going on there and any initiatives to improve those higher-margin categories? Todd Vasos : Yes, the great thing about our nonconsumable categories is that the team has done a fabulous job, the buying team, over the many years that we've been working on this. Up until this quarter, we've had 9 consecutive quarters of growth in our nonconsumables. And I would tell you that the slowdown there is directly correlated to that traffic slowdown that we've seen, which is really, I believe, consumable based. And that's why we're taking the actions on price that we are and other things to ensure that we get that traffic back in the store as we move through the quarters to come. Once that happens, we are confident. We are confident in our nonconsumable merchandising and our pricing there, and we've always said that consumables will drive the traffic and nonconsumables will round out the basket, and we see it no different as we move forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : In the areas where you saw greater competitive NC [ph], did your comp underperform the total and by how much? Todd Vasos : I can tell you that we did not see an underperformance in any measurable amount in areas that we know that there's been some competition heating some things up. We have not seen that. We are very confident in our overall pricing strategy and structure, to be honest with you. Our consumers give us a tremendous amount of credit for pricing and the value that we offer. How we are looking at these recently announced price reductions, they're more proactive in nature in areas that we see we have opportunity to capture additional market share. In areas that we may not be quite as good, if you will, from a traffic standpoint as we are in other parts of the country, and so we're proactively taking steps to ensure that we bolster those areas. And then as we expand this program over time, it'll be, once again, proactive in nature where we think the opportunity to steal share is best achieved, as well as where our consumer needs us most, and a lot of them are within these 20 states that have recently cut SNAP. Michael Lasser : So to reconcile some of this, so you're not seeing the stores in areas that are more competitive underperforming, but are those the same places that you're going to be investing in price? And how do you expect to fund those price investments? Will that be on your P&L or do you expect to share that burden with your vendors? Todd Vasos : There may be some overlap where there may be some other retailers doing some price initiatives as we speak. But again, we're not focused on chasing any one competitor. We're more focused on what we can control, and that is looking in areas that we know that we can expand our market share in. So while there'll be some overlap, that isn't the driving factor or force behind where we go. The other thing to keep in mind here is that we do have the wherewithal to do this, as I mentioned earlier. And we have great relationships with our vendor partners. And rest assured that they're working with us hand in hand as we continue to drive units and traffic into our stores and into their brands. Michael Lasser : And if I could just add a follow-up, Todd. Understood the issues with SNAP and deflation, but is there a piece of this that's just related to the consumer jobs' labor market getting better, so the consumer spending a little bit better and they're trading up? Is that not possible? Todd Vasos : I'm not going to say it's not possible, but we have not seen that in our data. Once again, remember that over 60% to 65% of our sales and consumer base is on that lower demographic area that -- of the economic scale. And when you keep that in mind, her life hasn't gotten any better. And that's really that customer that we're serving the most and that we're intent on making sure has enough money and enough products inside her house to be able to feed her families. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder of Jefferies. Daniel Binder : Just on the same topic of price competition. Can you be a little bit clearer in terms of which channel you're seeing the most activity out of? Is it the discount channel? Is it the supermarkets? Is it the dollar stores, as Family Dollar does things under the Dollar Tree ownership? Any color you can provide on that? And particularly on the regions that you mentioned, any particular that stand out? Todd Vasos : Yes, I think that some of the price reductions taken by other retailers have been fleshed out pretty good out in the press. So I believe everyone knows some of the retailers that are working price right now. But as I mentioned earlier, we've seen that over the years and over time. And we compete very well with mass merchant retailers, grocery and drug retailers. And then the only thing is we -- again, our consumers give us a lot of credit for where our prices are today. We're some of the lowest in the marketplace with nearly being at parity with mass, 20% on average lower than grocery and 40% plus lower everyday than drug on the shelf. And when you think about it in those terms, we feel very confident that our pricing structure is well intact, and this is all about everyday low price for our consumer. She needs to have the confidence that if she walks in, she has an everyday low price. She doesn't have to wonder whether it's on sale or if she has to buy 5 or 10 at a time to get the deal. She know she can walk in, buy one and get the deal that she needs. Daniel Binder : And then just as a follow-up, you cited some pressure with the consumer. If we maybe look forward a couple of quarters or even a year, if the comp store sales don't get back to 3% at some point and we kind of linger here in that 1% to 2% range, does that impact the way you think about square footage growth. I know you've got the 1,000 store plan here set, and that's probably likely to get executed, but as you think beyond next year? Todd Vasos : When we look at our new store program, it is doing exactly what it has been doing, and what we thought it would do over time. We are very happy with that. We don't see that slowing down. It is still opening -- the stores are still opening at 80% to 85% of our mature store base. The returns are 20% plus on these new store locations, and we have seen no difference this year than any other year in our new store openings. As a matter of fact, we're indexing over 101% right now on our portfolio for 2016. So when you look at all those dynamics and that low cost to operate and low cost to build, I can't think of a better place for us to reinvest our money than in that first, in the business, and then returning to shareholders, second. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vinny Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : I wanted to ask, I appreciate all the color you gave us around the details supporting the sales number. I know you typically kind of rank order the factors in your release, and just a couple of quick points of clarification. Within the food deflation part of that, which was listed first, can you give any further color around kind of how much of that was strictly from the commodity price changes versus kind of increased competition within? And also this might just be my own paranoia, but I know it was kind of a separate sentence where you talked about the competitive environment. So with the kind of expectations you had for the quarter, is it safe to say that, that being kind of in the second sentence, is kind of the last in rank order as well? Todd Vasos : Yes, I think that is correct, first of all. Once again, we just don't see that competitive nature being the largest factor here. What we see again is that SNAP reduction and that deflation being some of the biggest headwind, and then second -- third after that being just the overall macro environment for our core consumer. When you look at the deflation, it is primarily due to commodity price reductions, so cost reductions to us, which we then pass on to the consumer at lower retails. Predominantly, that's what we're talking about here, and it's in big categories for us, right, in milk and eggs. Remember, we don't have the breadth and depth that mass or grocery has in our perishable and food businesses. So when that deflation hits in some of these key categories, it hits us a little harder, so in those 2. But also beyond that in dry grocery, we still see sugar, grain, cereals, coffee, so some of our largest categories being affected by cost decreases, which then, in turn, become retail decreases. And as we all know, the consumers don't consume that much more just because the price is a little less expensive. So that is really the impetus behind what we see as some of those headwinds. And as I said before, those headwinds, we anticipate seeing with us through the back half of the year. Vincent Sinisi : Okay, that's helpful, Todd. And maybe just a quick follow-up, and this is more just kind of top -- top look at the group and the consumer. But like you said today, you're maybe even seeing some increased pressure on the low-end consumer. And I think most of us on the phone kind of thought it was not a fantastic low-end consumer, but more or less of a steady state. So maybe if any kind of anecdotes from what you're seeing specifically in the baskets or how folks might be responding when you are proactively getting more aggressive. How should we kind of think about the overall low end in your opinion as we go forward here? Todd Vasos : Yes, you know that consumer is a real special consumer. We spend a lot of time in the stores. I'm out a couple of times a month with our head merchant, our head operator, and we see first-hand this consumer each and every time we're out. And this core consumer, I tell you, has gotten no better as far as her economic well-being. As a matter of fact, she tells us, while we're out in the stores or even through all of our panel data that we do, that while things haven't gotten a lot worse as far as income coming in, other than the recent SNAP decrease, I -- my expenditures are going up at a very rapid rate. Health care is one of the big ones because most of our consumers, while she may be working, doesn't have health care, and we all know that she's having to now pay for this health care or be taxed on it, right? So that is starting to really play against that low-end consumer right now, and it will continue to play against her. You couple that with those rents that we talked about, those increased rents are real. And in any many parts of where we serve our customer, the affordability and availability of rental units are getting more and more scarce, which is driving up prices, and we're seeing that because most of our core customers cannot and do not own their own homes. And when we're out in the stores and we drop prices like we do, I can tell you, I've been out in stores in the middle of the aisle, and heard customers come up to our store manager in tears and thanking them for being there and thanking them for the prices that we offer in a real convenient nature for her where we can she can walk to the store because she can afford anything else. When you hear that, that really brings home where this core customer is. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : Just one quick follow-up. On your long-term guidance, I think you'd outlined opportunities for margin expansion across both gross margin and SG&A. I guess as we think about the price investments and those building blocks, do those change and are there other offsets whether that's through, I think, the earlier question on vendor funds, shrink or other areas? Todd Vasos : Sure. So as we've said, we're really focused on looking at margin, on SG&A in tandem and continue to see opportunity over the long term. This team has done a phenomenal job over the years managing the multiple levers within gross margin and you've seen that with 6 straight quarters of margin expansion. And it continues to be the same levers in terms of shrink, which we continue to see as an improvement opportunity over time. We continue to drive expense control and efficiencies around DC and trans, and the team continues to effectively manage the levers of category management, private label and foreign sourcing, and we also work with our vendors to make sure that we can hit those price points. On the SG&A side, as you saw, we had tremendous performance over the last 2 periods with zero-based budgeting. We've always had a history of lean cost management and zero-based budgeting has really taken hold and helped us get to that next level of savings. And you've see that in the results, and the team is working on a pipeline of future savings focused on noncustomer-facing areas, and the rigor is really becoming ingrained. So we will continue to work those 2 over time. As we've said, not every quarter is created the same and there's some headwinds in the near term. But we continue to see opportunity over the longer term, managing all these levers, as we have in the past. Mary Winn Pilkington : Hope, that will now conclude our call since we've hit the top of the hour. I know we're leaving a few people in the queue, but I'm around and Matt's around if we can help with any questions. But thank you very much for being on the call today. So Hope, you can wrap the call up. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call, except as may be otherwise required by law or as described under the heading Financial Outlook set forth in our earnings press release issued today. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. On today's call, I would first like to share our perspectives on the third quarter and review some of its highlights, then turn it over to John to take you through a more detailed review of the quarter and our outlook for fiscal year. I will then provide insights into our strategic action plans going forward. Since we last spoke in our earnings call at the end of August, the retail environment has continued to be challenging, although we are pleased to see some of our traffic and sales-driving actions beginning to take hold as we exited the third quarter. As I shared with you last quarter, we have taken a number of actions across merchandising and store operations to drive same-store sales, all while being very disciplined in our SG&A spending. Although our sales and earnings fell short of our expectation, I believe we made progress on our initiatives in the quarter. Together, the team has spent a tremendous amount of time and resources on the analytics of our business and the targeted actions going forward. As the deflation cycle continued in the quarter, we have reevaluated how we're looking at the impact, ultimately taking a more broad-based view. Rather than limiting our view to commodity cost of milk and eggs, we expanded our analysis to the average unit retail price deflation. Applying this broader view of deflation to both our second and third quarters, we experienced a greater impact in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. We estimate that the combined headwinds from the average unit retail price deflation and reduction in SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the third quarter by approximately 150 to 175 basis points and for our second quarter by approximately 100 to 115 basis points. We believe many of these issues are transitory in nature. Now let's turn to some of the highlights for the third quarter of 2016 as we compare it to the prior year quarter. Third quarter sales increased 5% to $5.3 billion. Year-to-date through the third quarter, net sales were $16 billion, an increase of 5.9%, over the comparable prior year period. Same-store sales declined 0.1% for the quarter as an increase in average transaction size was offset by softer customer traffic. Same-store sales growth was positive for consumables, offset by decline in the nonconsumable categories In terms of the sales cadence for the quarter, August and October were both positive with October being the strongest period of the quarter. Year-to-date through the third quarter, same-store sales increased 0.9% over the comparable prior year period. For the quarter, diluted EPS was $0.84, including approximately $0.05 for store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses. During the quarter, we returned $295 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.9 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. We successfully converted 42 Walmart Express locations to the Dollar General banner. These locations are performing well ahead of our expectation and provide us with great insights to apply to our existing store formats and future opportunities. The store operation team continues to aggressively work towards improving our on-shelf availability. We are seeing progress, as our third-party audits indicate, that our stores have reduced their out of stocks on core items by 13% over prior year third quarter. Our real estate model is the foundation of driving strong returns. We continue to see our new store productivity at around 80% to 85% of our comp base, all while driving returns over 20%. For 2016, we're on track to open 900 new stores and relocate or remodel a combined 900 stores. The real estate and store operations team have done a tremendous job in executing our store growth plans. We continue to grow transaction and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced low single digit to mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. I'm especially encouraged that we experienced a notable share change trend improvement in the most recent 8-week data. During the third quarter, we invested gross margin dollars in a number of strategies designed to drive traffic. Some of these initiatives performed better than others, but I believe we learned important lessons that will guide us in being more effective with the spending going forward. Based on the recent work we've done to analyze the business and to test various initiatives, we believe that we have identified those actions and strategies that provide the best opportunity to drive traffic and ultimately, profitable sales growth. We are moving fast to aggressively pursue the actions that we believe will drive our same-store sales performance improvements. During the quarter, we made pricing, labor and marketing investments in designated market areas where we saw opportunities to be proactive as we look to improve same-store sales and market share with the objective to provide our customers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most. Our proactive pricing actions were implemented selectively across about 70% of our store base or on about -- and on about 450 items targeting high-household-penetration, fast-turning categories. While these investments take time to deliver the full impact, we are seeing the expected improvements in transactions, units and weekly same-store sales across the vast majority of stores where we have made these investments. We believe we are on the right track with these selective price investments, which are noticeable to our consumers. As I mentioned, while some of the third quarter investments resulted in the desired performance, others did not. For instance, we invested in incremental promotional activities to drive traffic, although results were mixed and did not meet our overall expectations. As such, this is an area we look to be more effective in deploying gross profit dollars going forward. Additionally, as we move through the quarter, it became apparent to our -- incremental actions would not be able to overcome the decline in traffic in our stores. Both traffic-driving consumables and basket-building nonconsumables were impacted, requiring greater-than-anticipated markdowns to move through the inventory and keep our merchandise in the stores fresh. Based on our learnings, we have focused our efforts on the most efficient and impactful activities, and we will continue to monitor these traffic-driving initiatives and continue to optimize these investments to achieve the best returns. I have confidence in this retail management team that has successfully navigated other challenging sales environments. We remain committed to controlling the factors that we can control and seizing the opportunities we have identified to improve our performance. With that, let me now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. For the 2016 third quarter and year-to-date, I will share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook. Gross profit for the 2016 third quarter was $1.6 billion or 29.8% of sales, a decrease of 49 basis points from last year's third quarter. As compared to the prior year third quarter, the most significant drivers were higher markdown, primarily for inventory clearance and promotions; a greater proportion of sales of lower-margin consumables; and increased inventory shrink, partially offset by higher initial inventory markups. SG&A expense in the quarter increased by 48 basis points over the comparable 2015 period to $1.2 billion or 22.5% of sales. The SG&A increase was due in part to increased retail labor and occupancy costs. In addition, we incurred charges and related expenses of $13 million or 25 basis points associated with the acquisition of the former Walmart Express store locations. These expenses were primarily related to lease termination costs for existing stores and costs related to the conversion of acquired stores to DG stores. We also incurred an increase of $7.7 million or 14 basis points of disaster-related expenses in the 2016 period, most of which were hurricane related. Partially offsetting these items were reductions in administrative payroll costs, incentive compensation expenses and advertising costs. For comparability, please keep in mind that 2015 third quarter SG&A results reflect expenses of $6.1 million or 12 basis points for severance-related benefit costs associated with the corporate restructuring of certain support functions. In light of our same-store sales performance for the quarter, I am pleased with the way the team managed our SG&A expenses. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we would have successfully leveraged SG&A expenses on our same-store sales performance of 0.9% had it not been for the store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses mentioned earlier. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.2%. As in the first half of the year, our effective tax rate was lower this quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter, primarily due to the recognition of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit in the quarter in which it is earned, given changes by congress in December 2015. Moving now to our balance sheet and cash flow statement. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.49 billion, up 5.6% on a per-store basis. Key factors impacting this increase were our on-shelf availability initiative and the timing of receipts, coupled with our sales performance with the actions we have in place designed to help get inventory growth in line with our sales growth. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape and we are comfortable with the quality. And the increase was mainly in our everyday planogram categories or what we think of as core items. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated cash from operations of $1.12 billion, an increase of 39% or $315 million compared to the 2015 third quarter, primarily as a result of working capital improvements and higher net income. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for $225 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding totaling $70 million. Year-to-date to the end of the third quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $892 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividend. From December 2011 through the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased $4.3 billion of 70.2 million shares of our common stock. At the end of the third quarter, our remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $1.2 billion. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store base, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Looking ahead, we are realistic about the environment in which we are operating. We now expect that our fiscal 2016 diluted EPS growth will be at the low end of our long-term growth model range of 10% to 15%. This outlook includes the impact of the charge for the store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses in the third quarter and the benefit from the 53rd week this year of approximately $0.09 per diluted share. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Fair Labor Standard Act's new salary requirement, it does not include any incremental expense related to the potential implementation of that regulation. In the event that the new salary requirement under the Fair Labor Standards Act is implemented, we anticipate that this would be an incremental annualized expense of approximately $60 million to $70 million or $0.03 for the 2016 fourth quarter. Please keep in mind that we had an incremental $0.04 per diluted share benefit from the reenactment of the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit in Q4 2015. We anticipate providing further details on our 2017 initiatives when we release our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results in March 2017. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. Well, while we are still in our planning process for fiscal 2017, we remain focused on our 4 operating priorities for growth : first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first priority is to drive profitable sales growth. Our goal is to attract and grow new consumers and trips and capture share with existing customers, utilizing our customer segmentation work and our disciplined approach to category management. To enhance our value proposition, we are committed to providing our customers with everyday low prices that they know and trust from us. Clearly, our consumers' budgets are pinched. The cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors, such as the reduction of staff participation and benefit levels and increased housing and health care expenses, appear to have taken a noticeable toll on their spending. Our goal is to be there for our customers when they need us the most. We remain committed to refreshing our price investments across items and categories as well as incremental markets. Our changes would be made as needed in a very rational manner as we move through the coming quarters with the goal to drive traffic and units and capture market share. To further enhance our value proposition, we are also focused on refining our advertising effectiveness to drive productive sales growth with a continued focus on everyday low prices that resonate with our customers. For 2017, we plan to further integrate our traditional and digital media mix to work together to ensure we are reaching our target consumers where, when and how they decide to engage with us. Through applied predictive technology, we are conducting a test and learn to gain further insights into our ability to achieve a higher return on investment on our advertising media mix. A key area of focus for 2017 is to build on our 2016 progress to expand the merchandising initiatives that focus on our mature store base to drive our same-store sales. For a select group of these stores, we anticipate a more extensive 4-wall remodeling effort that we believe will provide compelling returns. The recent acquisition of the former Walmart Express stores gives us great insights as we develop the remodel program for these stores. Merchandising initiatives across all departments have been deployed to provide consumers with more of the products and brands they want and need to save time and money every day across this group of stores. Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. In 2017, we plan to accelerate our square footage growth to about 7.5%. Our 2017 pipeline is essentially complete as we continue to plan for about 1,000 new store openings. The primary format will be our traditional DG box, which is about 7,300 square feet of selling space and provides us with strong new store economics and returns. This format consistently proves to be our highest-return format against which we benchmark the performance of all other formats. We expect that these traditional stores will utilize our successful Dollar General 16 layout to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format, all while providing consumers with a faster checkout. We are planning for the future as we segment our store opportunities that we believe can have a greater impact on sales and productivity, all while continuing to drive compelling returns. We view this as more of an evolution of our existing, highly productive, traditional store format rather than a wholesale change. We are in a unique position to leverage knowledge across our multiple formats, given that Dollar General has always been a leader in store format innovation. I view our store formats along a continuum of selling square footage. On one end, we apply lessons from the best-selling items in our 16,000-square-foot Dollar General market stores to our newly acquired 10,000-square-foot box. Both of these formats give us great experience with fresh produce and meats. From there, we move along the continuum to the 9,000-square-foot Dollar General Plus with about 30-or-so cooler doors and more holding power on the shelf. Next, we tailor the assortment to our 7,300-square-foot traditional box. With over 12,500 traditional stores, this box will always be core to our model. Finally, we have been pleased with the test results of our smaller box, that is less than 6,000 square feet for certain metro and rural locations. Across the formats, we constantly are editing the assortments and taking our best-selling items from one format to the next to satisfy our customers' changing needs while driving -- while continuing to drive productivity. Key consumer trends going forward that are becoming more important to our core consumers include healthier, better-for-you options and a greater fresh assortment. Our range of formats positions us well to seek opportunities to capture this growing customer sentiment. Given that we are still in the planning process, I look forward to sharing more with you over the coming months. To support our new store growth and productivity, we continue to make investments in our distribution center network. Our Janesville, Wisconsin distribution center is nearing completion, with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in early 2017. Our 15th distribution center in Jackson, Georgia is also under construction, with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in late 2017. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. The team has embraced the spirit and process of zero-based budgeting that we implemented last year as part of the 2016 budget. We have had great success in leveraging our culture and heritage of cost management with our zero-based budgeting program across our cost structure. As we enter year 2 of our zero-based budgeting process, the team is actively working on a pipeline of additional future savings, opportunities across the company leveraging process improvement, procurement and prioritization to remove costs that don't affect the customer experience. Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. In the third quarter, we redesigned our store manager training program. And while it's still early, we are seeing almost a 20% improvement in satisfaction scores from those store managers who have gone through the program. We have exciting opportunities ahead of us. Our test-and-learn program is a foundation of our continual improvement we believe are positioning Dollar General to be even more relevant to help our customers save time and money now and in the future. We remain confident in our long-term growth prospects of the company and are moving quickly and deliberately to restore traffic to our stores. Our stores are prepared for the holidays, and we have a strong plan in place for the remainder of the holiday selling season with exciting gifts, decor, toys and other holiday necessities and multiple avenues to save in-store and online. Our customers can take advantage of our holiday offerings and stretch their holiday budget even further. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. We have strong new-store economics with returns above 20% and a payback under 2 years. Our team is energized to seize growth opportunities. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in accelerated store growth as well as our mature store base, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and anticipated dividends. We remain very excited about our business over time. In closing, I want to recognize more than -- the more than 120,000 Dollar General employees who serve our customers every day. We are in the midst of our busiest season in retail, and our customers are depending on us for convenience and everyday low prices. I want to thank all of our employees for their contributions to our mission of serving others. With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you. [indiscernible] We'll take the first question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Based on the initiatives that you deployed and what you saw in October, Todd, do you think you're at the point where you could start to see some more consistent gains in your traffic? Or is your expectation that traffic is just going to be lumpy from here for at least the near term? Todd Vasos : Yes, Mike, that's a great question. As we came out of October and then into November, we saw continued traction from those initiatives. It was great to see that our pricing initiatives start to really take hold as well as all the initiatives that we really launched in early '16 around our merchandising pieces. Those continue to gain traction throughout the year and especially in the third quarter and now into the fourth. But keep in mind that we are still seeing those headwinds from the SNAP participation rates being down as well as deflation. So a little choppiness is probably the right way to look at it, but we're very encouraged on how we see our initiatives taking hold and taking shape. And again, as we saw our comp sales improving throughout the quarter and especially in October and now moving into November, we feel good about a lot of the initiatives that we put in place. Michael Lasser : And my follow-up question is, could you dimension the performance of those stores that you -- the 70% of the stores that you made those price investments? And are those outperforming the chain average? And are you seeing a lift to the entire store? So is the customer coming in and buying the discretionary goods as well to offset some of the gross margin pressure that you probably seen from those investments? Todd Vasos : Yes, that's another great question, because as we stated earlier on, it takes a little time for these price investments to take hold with the consumer. But the great thing is, as we move through Q3, we saw the units transactions and sales starting to build momentum. And actually, as we exited Q3 and entered Q4, we even saw a further acceleration of that. Whereas, we have actually crossed over where we're now returning pretty nicely on our investment. So again, in the quarter, quarter 3, we spent a little bit to get it moving. But now, it's really starting to pick up, so we feel good about where it's headed. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Alan Rifkin : So in sort of looking at your revenue [indiscernible] as it relates to [indiscernible] categories... Mary Winn Pilkington : Hey, Alan, it's Mary Winn. Hey, Alan, I'm sorry to interrupt, but we're having a real hard time hearing you. Alan Rifkin : Can you hear me better now? Mary Winn Pilkington : Yes. Alan Rifkin : Okay. In looking at your comp gains with respect to categories, it seems as if the categories, that consumables, where arguably the deflation is greatest, are actually outperforming some of the more discretionary categories like apparel and home, that is actually less deflation. Can you help explain that apparent anomaly? And then I do have a follow-up. Todd Vasos : Yes. The real thing to look at there is that a lot of our initiatives coming into the year 2016 were around those traffic-driving areas. So again, around perishables in the food areas and immediate consumption. So while we're facing great headwinds on deflation there, what we're starting to see is that those initiatives are overtaking even some of those deflationary pressures. But make no mistake, those headwinds are pretty strong, and that's why we said we feel pretty good about where we're headed because those initiatives are really taking hold in those categories. And as we look at this pretty transitory. And as those deflationary pressures hopefully start to ease mid next year, when we pop out of the other side, we should be in very good shape. Because the initiatives that we deployed to include some of the traffic-driving initiatives around our pricing that we've recently implemented are in a lot of those consumable, high-discretionary categories that are out there for the consumer. So I think, all in all, we made the right decisions. And as we come out of this, we should be in a much better shape. Alan Rifkin : Okay. And Todd (sic) [John], if I may, you said that while most of your leases for 2017, you're committed to, did you give any consideration to possibly slowing down the 1,000 new stores that are now being earmarked for 2017, just in case things are not as transitory as what you hope they'll be? And in that regard, if, in fact, the environment continues to be difficult for longer than what you foresee, what incremental efforts with respect to zero-based budgeting could possibly be implemented to help reign in the cost structure? John Garratt : Good questions. To start with the question around real estate. The way we see it now, this is something we watch very closely, monitor the sales performance and the returns. And we continue, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we continue to see the stores open as expected at the 80% to 85% sales productivity. We continue to see the returns above 20% above our target. We continue to see paybacks in less than 2 years. And given the low-risk, low-cost, high-return opportunity we see here, we're proceeding, but watching it very carefully and understand that this is something that we could dial back quickly if needed. But based on the great results we continue to see and the belief that the pressures on the comps are largely transitory in nature, we don't see a need to do that thus far part, but we'll closely manage that. And in terms of the second question around zero-based budgeting, our ability to dial back that even more, we're very pleased with the performance that we've seen with zero-based budgeting. When you consider in the difficult environment we've been operating, the team's done a phenomenal job managing costs, looking at everything through the lens of, does it touch the customer? Is it in line with our strategic priorities? Does not doing this put the business at risk? And so were -- we have, and we're going to continue to go after all the cost we can, continually but thoughtfully, and making sure that over time, we're also -- as we manage the business for the long term, investing in those initiatives that will drive long-term growth. But rest assured, the team is hard at work on zero-based budgeting. It's performing better than expected this year. When you consider it, if you exclude the impact of the relocations of the acquired stores and the disaster-related costs, we would be leveraging our SG&A at 0.9% comp versus the stated target at the beginning of the year where we lowered it from 3.5% to -- and creeping up toward 4% to 2.5% to 3%. So we're ahead of schedule. We feel great about what we've done. But we'd be very balanced going forward in doing the right things for the business for the right long term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So a couple of things on pricing. It sounded to me like right now, there is no plan to expand the scope of those price cuts. Is that right? Is the average cut still about 10% on those items? And then what kind of competitive response, if any, have you seen? Todd Vasos : John, we're continue to monitoring the investment that we did make in pricing. Remember, it's really only a quarter old right now. And while we're very pleased and we're gaining traction, we're going to continue to monitor it to ensure that we've got the right items and is driving the proper returns that we expect to get from that. So I think, it's fair to say that we'll continue to monitor that for a bit longer. And as you look at it, yes, we see that when you look at the competitive environment for Q2, it's been about -- or I'm sorry, in Q3, it's been about the same as Q2. So overall, I would tell you that it's aggressive out there, but not anymore than we've seen in Q2. And I'm sure, when we monitor prices, everyone monitors prices and we look at what everyone else is doing. But I can tell you that what we're squarely focused on is what we can control and driving traffic into our stores and being there for our consumer. So we're pretty pleased on what we've seen so far. John Heinbockel : Well, let me follow up to that. If you think about -- it's really 2 things, one more sort of theoretical and one more real. If you look at the items where you've cut pricing on, are you getting a better response where there is or is not cost deflation? And then just theoretically, high level, do you think price investments work better? When we start to reflate, is it better to hold back pricing than when all the competition is raising price rather than cutting now when everybody has the potential right to take pricing down because their costs are falling? Todd Vasos : Well, when we look at the 450-or-so items that we've taken price on, I can tell you that in face of deflation, we're still seeing the entire store really start to react in a real positive manner on the sales side. Some of those items are not reacting the way we thought. We'll roll some off. We'll roll some new ones on. And as you could imagine, some that have heavy deflationary pressures, the top line may not be as robust. But again, it's not always about the sales piece right off hand. Eventually, it is, but it's about driving traffic and units to the store. And we've always said that we're going to do everything we have to do to drive traffic, John. And we continue to do that because we believe through any economic cycle, whether it be deflationary or inflation, that if you're there for the consumer when she needs you the most, that when you come out the other side of those economic times, she's going to stick with you. We've proven that time and time again, and I believe this will be no different. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : I actually just wanted to clarify on the 17% of the store base, are your comps in those stores positive currently? Todd Vasos : Again, when you look at -- in aggregate, we look at it by geographic area and, of course, in aggregate. And again, we're pretty happy with what we're seeing there. And the great thing about the comps in those stores, that it's lifting both consumables and nonconsumables. It started with more of the consumable areas, as you can imagine. But as we started to build not only units going through the register because of the better prices, when we started to see traffic start to increase because word of mouth getting out there plus our advertising, we're now starting to see transactions start to move through and more sales. So we're pretty happy with where it is right now. It's still early, but it's doing exactly what we thought it would do. And actually, on the sales side, maybe a little bit better than we thought it would do this early on. Karen Short : Okay, that's helpful. So I guess, I'm just wondering, with all that success, why you wouldn't consider rolling this out to a greater percent of store base or potentially broadening it to a greater number of SKUs. Todd Vasos : We're very much a real disciplined company, and we want to make sure that we're doing exactly what's right for the profitability of the company at the end of the day. So we're -- this is a real test and learn for us, right? But it's a pretty big one, 17% of the store base today has these prices in it. So I think, it's prudent to give in a little bit more time to percolate, if you will, and to continue to grow. And as that happens and we see it performing the way we think it's going to perform, then as we get into next year, I think we'll continue to look at ways to expand that and to be there for our customer to continue to give her that everyday low price that she needs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Alison Levens : This is Alison Levens on for Stephen. Can you provide more detail around gross margin in the quarter? Specifically, can you quantify the impact of price investment versus inventory clearance? John Garratt : Sure. So after driving 6 straight quarters of expansion in Q3, we did have contraction of 49 basis points in Q3. The key drivers there were markdown, mix and inventory shrink. Markdowns, being the most significant driver, as it was listed first. And that was both in consumables and nonconsumables, first is we moved through inventory with clearance and markdowns to keep the inventory fresh. The good news here is that the quality of the inventory is in great shape. And then also with the tougher sales environment in Q3, we had additional promotional activity, as we mentioned, with the goal of driving the top line and are pleased with the results we're seeing and the learnings we've captured from that to be more targeted, more focused on targeted pricing and EDLP and optimizing the spend for maximum results going forward. And again, pleased with the momentum we saw coming out of the quarter and into this quarter. So those were the key drivers there. We feel like with the actions we've taken here, that's the best actions for the long term. And I think with the learnings going forward, we'll be able to be more targeted with this and continue to see opportunity over the long term. Managing the various levers, we continue to see opportunity to reduce shrink over time, supply chain efficiencies, strong category management and opportunities around increased foreign sourcing and private-label penetration as we look at the long term. Alison Levens : Great. Very helpful. And then just as a follow-up, can you provide more detail regarding what changed with respect to the SNAP headwinds in 3Q versus 2Q? Todd Vasos : Yes, when we look at it, it was about the same when we look at our SNAP-affected states. I'll give you a little color. Really, what's interesting here is a lot like Q2, Q3 was pretty close to about the same. But if you look at it, it affects about 56% of our store base in the states that have reduced or eliminated these SNAP benefits. And those states that have had the reduction or elimination, they are approximately 100 basis points worse in comp. That gives you a real good idea of how impactful those SNAP benefits reductions have been. Again, we feel it's transitory. We'll move through that as we move through 2017. But right now, that's why we've really taken a real hard look at reducing prices for those core consumers, especially in and around those states because they need us right now based on what we see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : When you look at the deflation and SNAP headwinds of 150 to 175 basis points, if we were to add that back in, you'd still be below your long-term guide of 2 to 4. Just looking forward, do you think as these headwinds abate, that you'd see some acceleration in traffic to get you back up into that range? And what might be driving that? Todd Vasos : When you look at it though, we feel pretty good about a lot of the initiatives that we got in play. We feel good about, early on, the initiatives for 2017 as we start to really shape those up. We had a little bit of a Halloween drag in Q3 that moved into Q4 for us. And not to make any excuses, but there's definitely some headwinds there. But I think what we're really focused on here is a lot of the great things that we have moving that we believe are going to be real positive to our same-store sales as we move into 2017 and some of these transitory effects start to abate and we start to see that the consumer starts to come back in the store as well as those deflationary pressures starting to ease. Over the long term, we believe that we can have comps in that 2 to 4 range over the long term. Peter Keith : Okay. Maybe now for John, just 2 unrelated quick follow-ups. Number one, could you quantify the Halloween impact on Q3 comp? And then secondly, I was unclear on how you're managing the overtime rule change announcement from last week with the injunction that was placed. Are you going forward with the changes? Or are you putting a pause on it to see how that transpires? Todd Vasos : Yes, this is Todd. Let me -- I'll take the second one first and have John quantify that Halloween impact for you. Right now, with the stay that is out there, we have communicated to our stores that we're in a holding pattern for right now to see exactly what happens in the courts and see exactly what transpires. So we are on hold, and the operating group has done a fabulous job in communicating that to our folks. And we're in a wait and see. So we, like you, will wait and see what happens. But at the end of the day, we always do what's right for our employees, right? And again, that's one of our 4 operating priorities is really taking care of our people. So we'll do what's right by them as we continue to move into '17. John Garratt : In terms of the Halloween shift, the impact, we believe it to be about 20 basis points impact on comps. And the Halloween shift had to do with 2 fewer selling days this quarter as the quarter ended on October 28 this year versus October 30 of last year, so about 20 basis points. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research. John Zolidis : You mentioned that you were very focused on doing what it took -- takes, rather, to drive traffic. And so my question is related to the long-term earnings growth target that you provided back earlier in the year of 10% to 15%, which I believe assumed relatively flat or slightly up EBIT margins. So my question is, can you make this price investment to drive traffic and still hold EBIT flat? Or would you be willing to sacrifice some EBIT margin to get incremental people through the door? John Garratt : Yes. So bear in mind, the model is a long-term growth model, and that's really where our focus is on over the long term. And we said from time to time, we will, as needed, make investments to do what's right to drive traffic and to drive that long-term growth. And so we'll do what we need to in that regard. But as I step back and just look at the fundamentals of the business, I still feel great about this business as you look at the organic growth opportunity, the great returns we continue to see from the new stores, with the actions we're taking to reinvigorate the comp sales growth and with all the levers we have in gross margin and SG&A with the addition of zero-based budgeting and with the tremendous amount of cash this business throws off that we can reinvest in new stores, in the business, while comparing -- providing a very compelling total shareholder return with the addition of dividends and share repurchases. Feel great about the model and the long-term prospects, but it's a long-term model. We'll do what we need to, invest where we need to along the way. John Zolidis : Okay, great. And just -- not a second question, on a different topic. You mentioned that the traditional DG format is your highest-return format. You got about 1,000 opening for next year. Can you give us a rough breakdown of openings by format? Todd Vasos : Yes. Again, overwhelmingly, the Dollar General traditional store, that 7,300-square-foot store that we talk about, will be the dominant, by far, the dominant player there. I believe, we're going to have about 150 to 160 of the smaller format stores next year in key metro and rural areas to augment that. But overall, it'll be that 7,300-square-foot store. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Appreciate the incremental color on the current headwinds deflation, SNAP. You said competition about the same as last quarter. Just wanted to see if you could give any further color around -- the low-end consumer health was one of the other things that you kind of more specifically called out last quarter. Versus then, kind of what are you seeing now either by basket, geography, et cetera? That would be great. Todd Vasos : Yes, interestingly, we talk to our consumers each and every quarter through panel data as well as we bring them in and talk to them in general. And I can tell you, as late as mid-third quarter, they were telling us that their sentiment, feeling is even more dire than it was in previous quarters in early 2016. And what they're citing and continue to cite is the rising health care costs that they're facing. I don't believe any of our core customers realize what they were up against on those rising costs. And then rental costs continue, and they called that out second on paying rent. Because most of our, again, core customers rent, don't own, and those rents are going up across the nation at a pretty high rate. And they have to continue to allocate their spending. So anywhere they are saving, they are doing some things a little differently than they've done before. For instance, they're investing in smartphone technology at a greater rate than we've ever seen. And those come with an expense, as we all know, a monthly expense. And so the little bit of money that she does may have, from maybe lower gas prices and some other tailwinds, she is moving into a little bit of a technology world herself very slowly, albeit, but she is moving there. So we're hearing a lot of the same things we've heard over the last couple quarters, but what was interesting to us was that she was feeling worse off today, middle of the third quarter, than she was earlier in the year. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. All right. Todd, that's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up, just going back to your initiatives. Kind of like you said, it seems a pretty similar scope, at least, going forward. But if we try to just reconcile kind of what may be working better or worse than you thought and even going back to Alan's question on kind of consumables, nonconsumables performance. As you're taking a broader view, do you think that there could be any change to kind of the focus of consumables versus nonconsumables or maybe some greater or less than that kind of 10% pricing that you had cited last quarter. Todd Vasos : Yes. As we look at the entire box, and we've got one of the most robust category management processes and teams in consumable retailing today. They do a great job in evaluating each and every year what should be inside of our stores and what those initiatives should be. And we've always said that the consumable initiatives and the consumable products will drive traffic, and our nonconsumable businesses will drive the basket. We see that no differently. And actually, we've seen our nonconsumable business tail off along with our consumable business, as that customer pulled back and especially in the SNAP-affected states. In saying that, a lot of our initiatives for this year and next year are both in consumables and in nonconsumables. Because we believe that you have to have a fine balance between the 2 to really round out the shopping experience for the consumer. And so we're looking at it really no differently. Now in consumables, there may be some differences in some of the products that we bring in because, again, our consumers are starting to look for better-for-you, more healthy, a little bit more fresh products. And the great thing about having the market stores, 150 or 160 market stores that we have as well as our Plus stores, we're able to infuse the best learnings and products into our traditional store from those formats. So there isn't any test-and-learn periods. We know what works, and we continue to bring those type of products to market in our 7,300-square-foot store. And you'll see even more of that, maybe even in a low accelerated rate as we move into 2017 because, again, our consumer preferences are changing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Fletcher with Bernstein. Brandon Fletcher : As retail a retail veteran who's done this in dozens of countries, I just want to say you guys are doing it right. You're doing it carefully. Test and control and the willingness to refine it is rare among leadership, and so just hang in there. You guys are getting it right. Our question's actually related to HBA. One of the things that the merchants were kind of excited about in the Investor Day was that was a place where a little more SKU, a little more brand, a little more focus could give you something your customers need and also places where you have an enormous price advantage to your kind of convenient pharmacist. How are those initiatives going? Just wanted to get some color on that. Todd Vasos : Yes. The health and beauty initiative, especially around health, has been one of our really shining stars of 2016 so far. Those initiatives have been doing very well. Remember, they fall into our consumable world as it relates to how we report and how you see those numbers, and they've been doing well. But we still believe we have a lot of opportunity there, and a lot of it really revolves around awareness. And while we've made great strides over the last 5 to 6 years on building loyalty in our HBA areas, we believe we still have a lot to go, not only in SKU proliferation there, probably more awareness and the ability for our consumers to know we have the products that she needs. And the great thing is, it's at a fabulous price, especially to our competition in the drug side and the grocery side of the equation. So as she learns and sees that those products are there, and she sees the great price, we've got her for life. And I think it's about awareness for her, and that's what we're going to work on into 2017. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So Todd, on learnings from this pricing initiative, I know we've had a number of questions around it. But I guess, you've done something like this in the past. How would you compare what you're seeing today from these metrics to the 2013 road map? And what was the time line back then that it took to see the traffic return? Todd Vasos : Yes. A little bit different time and date, but I could tell you that it's a lot like 2013. I could tell you, though, that what we saw in '13 versus '16 is transactions actually start to get more traction this time around than even in 2013, which has probably translated into a little bit better of a sale than we thought we were going to get by now and just moving into a profitable ROI on that. So it's actually ramped up a little faster. And I think, a lot of that also has to do with -- we were a little bit more aggressive this time on how we communicated that to the consumer as well as our operating group did a fabulous job executing, signing packages as well as our other in-store communication. So while I'd love to be able to compare it, it is a little bit different. But I can tell you that we're happy with what we've seen so far. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just on the gross margin front. As we think about some of the headwinds this quarter that hit you, as we think about you going forward, should we consider similar gross margin pressure through the front half of '17? Just any color on the puts and takes there would be helpful. John Garratt : Yes. So in terms of 2017, we're still in the budgeting process and weren't going to provide any updates on that at this stage. We will in the next call. But again, with gross margin, our focus is on the long term here and continue to see a lot of opportunities managing the various levers and look to balance gross margin on SG&A to offset things. So certainly, in a challenging environment, you do have the pressure of delivering that everyday low price. But we have a lot of other levers that we will look to manage effectively, as we have in the past, to balance that out to drive that growth while delivering bottom line results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Market. Bradley Thomas : You all done a lot of interesting work on customer segmentation you shared with us back in March. I was wondering, as you reflect on the traffic trends that you've seen over the last couple of quarters, if there are any interesting insights that you're able to share about the segmentations of your customer. Todd Vasos : Yes. We, again, as I mentioned earlier, we go out and talk to the customers each and every quarter. And again, I believe that the majority of what we communicated to everyone earlier in the year pretty well is still well intact as far as the consumer is concerned, except for the notion that she may be a little worse off today economically than she was even earlier in the year. At least, her sentiment is a little less positive. But in saying that, we're still seeing our -- what we affectionately call our BFF, which is our core best customers, continue to really resonate with our everyday low price. And through Q3, with all the traffic-driving initiatives we did, what really stuck and resonated the most was everyday low price. And that really goes to show you that the segmentation work that we do is right on in key, and that is our best customers look to us to deliver everyday low price first, because she needs to count on us each and every day. But in -- but beyond that, we're still seeing a healthy customer base outside of our core. Some of our reach customers, we're still seeing trade in and trade down-type customers coming in, and we're still seeing a decent millennial-type customer that really just started to emerge. And that's some of the reasons we're looking at even more better-for-you and healthier as well as maybe some fresh options as we go forward because that consumer is really starting to emerge as a real player here at Dollar General. Mary Winn Pilkington : Operator, I think if we've hit the top of the hour, let's probably go end our call now. So I want to thank everybody for being on the call. And if you have any questions, Matt and I are both around, so please feel free to give me or Matt a call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, March 16, 2017. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning.  Now I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.

Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call, except as may be otherwise required by law. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. I will start today's call by providing a review of the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 and our planned strategic investments for 2017. Then John will provide additional detail regarding our financial results and review our guidance for fiscal 2017. I will then come back and discuss our operating priorities for the coming year before opening the call up to questions. While our overall fiscal 2016 sales performance was softer than we anticipated when we entered the year, I'm very pleased with the way the team managed through what proved to be a challenging retail macroeconomic environment to deliver same-store sales growth of 0.9% and diluted earnings per share growth of 12% for the year.  We are continuing to strategically invest in our business for the long term. In fiscal 2017, these investments will be focused on an increased compensation structure and additional training for our store managers as they play a critical role in our customers' experience and the profitability of each store. Also, as I will discuss a bit later in the call, we are investing in strategic initiatives that we believe will help to differentiate us from the competition over time.  Now let's recap some of the financial results for fiscal 2016. Full year sales increased 7.9% over the prior year to $22 billion. Same-store sales for the year increased 0.9% over the prior year, marking our 27th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. Our same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 1% over the prior year fourth quarter, driven by strength in consumables and home, partially offset by negative performance in the seasonal and apparel categories.  For the full year, operating profit increased approximately 6%, with diluted earnings per share of $4.43. As compared to the prior year fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share improved 15% to $1.49 per share. For the year, we returned nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders.  We continue to believe many of the headwinds we faced in 2016 are transitory in nature such as the impact of average unit retail deflation, due in part to commodity cost declines as well as customer behavior due to changes to the federal SNAP benefits program. We estimate that overall average unit retail deflation and changes to SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for 2016 by approximately 115 to 125 basis points, with overall average unit deflation being the largest factor.  In 2016, we continued to deploy our capital to invest in new stores, relocations and remodels, which continued to provide compelling returns. We invested in our infrastructure, such as new distribution centers, to support continued growth. During the year, we celebrated the grand opening of our 13,000th store, opening 900 new stores and bringing our total store count to 13,320 stores at the end of our fiscal year. We increased our selling square footage by approximately 7% and remodeled or relocated a combined 906 stores, exceeding our initial target of 875 locations. We continue to be pleased with the return on investment and performance of our real estate program as our new stores overall are yielding returns of approximately 20%. We also continue to be very pleased with the performance of the 42 former Walmart Express locations that we purchased and rapidly converted to the Dollar General banner. Within our distribution network, we completed our 14th distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin. We began receiving inventory at this location in December 2016 and shipping in January 2017. During the third quarter, we started construction of our 15th distribution center in Jackson, Georgia and expect to begin shipping from this location in the fall of 2017. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network and to support our growing store base while reducing our stem miles.  As for the fourth quarter sales cadence, all periods have positive comps, with November and January exhibiting the best performance. In December, we, like many retailers, experienced a slowdown in traffic that impacted our same-store sales performance. Overall, the team did a great job during the fourth quarter to drive the top line with tight controls on gross margin and SG&A expense to allow us to deliver fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share growth of 12%. We estimate that the 53rd week of 2016 added approximately 2 percentage points to our EPS growth rate as compared to 2015.  We are constantly striving to meet the changing needs and demands of our customers. In the second half of the year, we made pricing and marketing investments in designated market areas where we saw opportunities to be proactive as we looked to help drive consumer traffic and improve same-store sales and market share. Our objective was and is to provide our customers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us the most. These proactive pricing actions were implemented selectively across about 17% of our store base and about -- and at about 450 targeted high household penetration, fast-turning categories. We are seeing anticipated improvements in transactions, units and weekly same-store sales across the majority of these participating stores. We believe we are on the right track as these investments are positively impacting sales and gross profit dollars.  In 2016, our digital coupon enrollment increased over 200% as we continue to expand our customer engagement through this innovative program that we brought to the channel. Importantly, the average basket for our digital coupon transactions continues to run more than 2x higher than our average basket, indicating that our customers appreciate the value being offered. We continue to increase our overall market share in highly consumables, growing mid-single digits based on the most recent syndicated data over the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending January 28, 2017.  With 2016 in the books, the team is focused on moving the business forward. Our recent strategic review is a very exciting part of advancing our business. With the full support and engagement of our Board of Directors, we undertook a comprehensive strategic review of our business, focusing on the actions that had the greatest potential to drive shareholder value over the longer term. We undertook this review and analysis from a position of strength as we believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. Over the last 8 months, the leadership team has conducted robust scenario analysis to envision the future of Dollar General through 2025. The goal of this review has been to assess our current performance, key trends and the evolving competitive landscape to align on the prioritized opportunities we should pursue for additional growth. We recognize customer preferences are changing more rapidly today than perhaps at any time in the retail history. And the current pace of change does not appear likely to slow.  Our review analyzed those trends that are changing and that are likely to change and how successful retailers are expected to do business over the next 10 years. While focusing on our customer base, we assess the size of the opportunities presented by these trends and how we can leverage our strengths to capitalize on them. The strategic initiatives determined as the best fit to be big ideas for Dollar General are more evolutionary in nature and are in keeping with our brand heritage and organizational capacities. They were also filtered through the lenses of one, growing the core; and second, extending into adjacent opportunities. These initiatives are in varying degrees of development with staggered implementation time horizons.  One area that we identified as near-term strategic opportunity is leveraging digital to influence our customers' shopping behavior over time. Digitally influenced sales are becoming more and more prevalent across retail as customers are increasingly utilizing and being targeted through digital channels and tools to shop smarter and faster.  Lower-income shoppers are also following these general trends as smartphone penetration continues to grow with this population. Digital engagement is expected to increase influence and influence retail sales, and our mission is to develop capabilities that highlight and improve our historical value proposition to our customers, namely, the intersection of value and convenience.  To do this, the -- we are focused on building capability centered on our core customers' needs, leveraging our unique assets. Capabilities to support this goal will be phased in over time. We are uniquely positioned to capitalize on our 13,000-plus and growing store base to be highly responsive to our customers in an evolving digital environment.  We are establishing a dedicated strategy department to work with the business owners to build out and coordinate the implementation of our initiatives. Over time, I look forward to sharing more with you on our strategic initiatives and how they support our 4 ongoing operating priorities.  Now let me turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through the highlights of 2016 and our strategic review, let me take you through some of the important financial details of the fiscal quarter and year. I will also spend some time discussing our 2017 guidance.  Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.6% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 19 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The gross profit rate decrease was primarily attributable to higher markdowns, driven mainly by promotional activities and inventory clearance and a greater proportion of sales of consumables. Partially offsetting these items were higher initial inventory markups. For the quarter, SG&A as a percentage of sales increased 6 basis points to 20.3%. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to retail labor costs, which increased at a rate greater than the growth in net sales. Partially offsetting these costs were reductions in incentive compensation expenses and administrative payroll costs, which were essentially unchanged.  In addition, we had an SG&A reduction totaling $4.5 million in the quarter associated with the sale or assignment of leases for a total of 12 store locations, which had been previously closed due to the acquisition of locations from another retailer. You may recall that we took a charge of $11 million in the third quarter of 2016 primarily for the lease terminations with the relocation of Dollar General stores into these purchased locations. This quarter's reduction in SG&A dollars is a partial offset of the previously recognized expenses.  Our tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% compared to 36.1% in the 2015 quarter due to the onetime benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of last year for retroactive tax benefit, primarily for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. Our balance sheet is strong, and our working capital is in good shape. Cash and cash equivalents at year-end were $188 million. Merchandise inventories were $3.26 billion at fiscal 2016 year-end, down about 70 basis points on a per-store basis year-over-year. For the year, growth in our inventory and net sales were very much in line.  Exiting the year, we believe our inventory is in excellent condition as the team has been focused on better aligning our inventory growth with our sales growth while also improving our in-stock position. In 2016, we generated cash from operations of $1.6 billion, an increase of 15% from the prior fiscal year. Total capital expenditures were $560 million in 2016 and included the majority of the cost of our new Janesville distribution center.  For the quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock for $311 million. Since late 2011 to the end of the 2016 fiscal year, we have repurchased $4.6 billion or 74.4 million shares of our common stock. As of year-end, we had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $930 million under our repurchase program.  We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in new and existing stores and the infrastructure to support our growth. Our goal is to create lasting value for our shareholders through our share repurchase program and anticipated quarterly dividend while maintaining our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. Turning now to guidance. For fiscal 2017, we anticipate net sales growth of 4% to 6%, with the lapping of the 53rd week in 2016 expected to negatively impact net sales growth by about 200 basis points. Growth in same-store sales is expected to be in the range of slightly positive to up 2%. With the investments in the business for store manager compensation, training and strategic investments, we anticipate deleveraging SG&A in 2017. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 is forecasted to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.50. Our fiscal 2017 diluted EPS guidance includes an anticipated negative impact, totaling approximately $0.34 per share, lowering the fiscal 2017 EPS growth rate by approximately 8 percentage points as follows : approximately $0.16 per share relating to anticipated store manager compensation and training, along with other strategic investments; approximately $0.09 per share due to lapping of the 53rd week in 2016; and approximately $0.09 per share for the combined impact from early adoption of income tax changes for stock-based compensation in 2016, lower estimated share repurchases in 2017 that will be weighted towards the second half of the year and anticipated charge related to the retirement of debt.  Capital spending is forecast to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million, with about 45% for new store growth, relocations and remodels; 35% to 40% for special projects, including our distribution center infrastructure to support our store growth; and the remaining 15% to 20% for maintenance.  As you model 2017, please keep in mind the following. We anticipate that in the second half of 2017, same-store sales and financial performance will be stronger than the first half, given the lapse from 2016. The 2016 53rd week also shifts the timing of markdown clearance from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2017, which we anticipate will negatively impact gross margin in the second quarter and have a corresponding benefit in the third quarter. As you look at the quarterly cadence, our EPS comparisons begin to ease in the 2017 third quarter. We anticipate that the third quarter will have the strongest EPS growth of any quarter in 2017. We will be lapping a $0.03 per share benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2016 for the company's early adoption of the income tax changes for stock-based compensation that we do not expect to reoccur to the same extent in 2017.  Our early Q1 same-store sales, particularly in February, started out slowly. However, as customers have received federal income tax refunds, we have noticed some improvement in overall comp sales trends. Additionally, to date, during the first quarter, we have experienced a more pronounced mix shift to the consumables category because of lower gross margin. We continue to believe that we have compelling new store economics [ph] with significant runway for growth across channels, customer and product segments that we intend to capture over time.  Looking beyond 2017, we remain focused on the long-term opportunity ahead of us with the goal of delivering 10% or higher earnings per share growth over the long term on an adjusted basis. We will continue to focus on the things that are within our control, including managing our working capital and always being a low-cost operator. We will also be financially disciplined in our capital allocation. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you. As John mentioned, we remain focused on capturing the long-term opportunities ahead. Our ongoing operating priorities remain : first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as our competitive advantage.  Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips and capture share with existing customers, a key area of focus for 2017 is to build on our 2016 progress. This includes expanding the merchandising initiatives in our existing store base to drive traffic into those stores and improve same-store sales. Based on the lessons learned from the conversions of our recently acquired Walmart Express locations to our Dollar General Plus format that include fresh meat and produce, we are remodeling about 300 traditional stores to include 34 cooler doors, an increase of about 160% from the existing cooler footprint in these locations. This allows for a much greater perishable assortment, which helps drive trips and basket size. Additionally, across about 1/3 of these locations, we are testing an assortment of fresh produce. We will also be strategically investing in the portion of our existing store base that has been opened for 5 years or more or what we define as our mature store base. We have a focus on stores that have fewer than 10 cooler doors, which in relative terms are expected to drive the highest returns. By the end of 2017, we anticipate that across our store base, we will have an average of 17 cooler doors up from 10 in 2012.  Merchandising initiatives across all departments have been deployed to provide consumers with more of the products and brands they want and need to save time and money every day across this select group of stores. For example, health and beauty represents large and growing departments at Dollar General. These products remain a significant opportunity for us to increase our share of wallet with our customers as well as have only -- we only have about half the share with our customers in these areas as compared to other consumables like paper and cleaning. We are also redesigning the health and beauty area of select group of stores to drive awareness and conversion.  For 2017, we plan to further integrate our traditional and digital media mix to ensure we are reaching our targeted customers where, when and how they decide to engage with us. Through applied predictive technology, we believe we have -- or we can drive greater productivity of our advertising media mix through optimization and modification of our spending, including reallocating funds previously used for our NASCAR sponsorship.  We will also leverage in-store operational initiatives, such as improving our on-shelf availability and our customer experience. We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion through improvements in shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution and transportation efficiencies and nonconsumable sales. As always, we will continue to ensure that our value proposition resonates with our customers. We are committed to providing them with everyday low prices that they know and trust from us.  Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth with a proven high-return, low-risk model. 1,000 new stores are in the pipeline for fiscal 2017, along with the combined 900 remodels or relocations, bringing our expected square footage growth in 2017 to about 7%, modestly below our previous forecast due to a greater mix of smaller stores. I believe we continue to have a first-mover advantage to secure the best sites while driving compelling new store average returns of approximately 20%.  The range of different DG formats is a strength that we can leverage based on the marketplace. We are able to flex our square footage to match the market opportunity, ultimately allowing us to have a higher capture rate for sites. The primary format we continue -- will continue to be our traditional Dollar General box, which is about 7,300 square feet of selling space and provides us with strong new store economics and returns. This format consistently proves to be our highest-return format against which we benchmark the performance of all others.  We are planning for the future as we segment our store opportunities that we believe can have a greater impact on sales and productivity while continuing to drive strong returns. We view this as more of an evolution of our existing, highly productive traditional store format rather than a wholesale change. As a leader in store format innovation, we are in the unique position to benefit from our knowledge across our multiple formats.  Given our success over the last 2 years with the results of our smaller box that has less than 6,000 square feet used in certain metro and rural locations, we anticipate opening an additional 160 locations this year, bringing the total smaller box store count to about 250 by the end of 2017. Finally, we are testing an even smaller box under the DGX banner, with about 3,600 square feet to target metropolitan shoppers with our everyday low prices on essential items in a convenient, easy-to-shop format. The DGX format is geared to meet the needs of our millennial shoppers, which are an emerging and important part of our customer base and will help us broaden our appeal to attracting new segment of urban customers who put a high premium on value and convenience.  We expect to learn valuable lessons about our Metropolitan shoppers from this format, which we can then apply to our other formats in urban locations. This test is in the very early stages, with 2 existing locations and 2 additional sites identified for 2017 store openings. Across the formats, we constantly are editing the assortments and taking our best-selling items from one format to the next to satisfy our customers' changing needs while continuing to drive productivity. For example, in addition to digital, our core customers are becoming more interested in healthier, better-for-you options and a greater fresh assortment. Our range of formats positions us well to seek opportunities to capture this growing customer sentiment as we continue to -- our cooler expansion that allows for a greater offering of perishable items. We are disciplined and focused on financial returns. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017 as our pipeline is full. Third, we will leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by this year's results, we have a clear and defined process to control spending. All of our spending is filtered through 3 criteria. First, is it customer-facing? Second, does it align with our strategic priorities? And finally, third, how does it impact our risk profile? In our stores, we are focused on simplifying our operations by reducing inventory, product movement within the stores and operating complexity so that our store managers and their teams can reinvest time savings to provide better customer service and a clean in-stock shopping experience for our customers. At the store support center, work elimination and process improvement are ongoing efforts to take cost out of the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator. Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication. In 2016, we had our lowest level of store manager turnover in 4 years.  To build on these improvements, we are making strategic investment in compensation and training for our store managers. Our data-driven approach to store manager compensation segments our stores based on labor market data and store-level complexity. We are making this investment in our store managers as we know what a key role they play in our customer experience and the profitability of our stores.  In 2017 and beyond, we expect that this investment will help to further reduce our turnover and an improved customer experience. Additional returns on this investment are anticipated through higher sales and lower shrink. In 2017, we plan to create approximately 10,000 new jobs as a result of our 1,000 planned new store openings and 2 new state-of-the-art distribution centers. The creation of new jobs will be roughly 9% overall increase to our workforce and marks the largest 1-year employee increase in our 78-year history.  As for our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions but acknowledge that for our core customer, it is always challenging. Given the pressures on her income and spending, regardless of the economic outlook for our customers, we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General.  This morning, an announcement that Jim Thorpe would be retiring from Dollar General. When Jim rejoined the company in 2015, we agreed upon a clear set of objectives for his tenure as Chief Merchandising Officer. As I knew he would, Jim has delivered on the merchandising strategies we identified as our highest priorities. I'm grateful for his contributions and want to wish Jim and his family the best.  Our strong business fundamentals and our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program and anticipated dividends.  I would like to recognize the drive and dedication of the more than 120,000 employees of Dollar General. Our focus remains on being successful over the long term. That success will be attributable to our people as we look to capitalize on our unique and powerful mission of serving others.  With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Mary Winn Pilkington : All right. Operator, we'll take the first question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So I guess, my question is -- the expectations you laid out for us this morning, does that anticipate any further price investments? Because you guys are kind of talking about labor and let's call it, operating cost increases. And the last 2 quarters or so, it's been more focused on price investments. So I guess, I'm just trying to get an idea where you think you are today in terms of the price investments, where are you going and -- or are we kind of competitively priced where you want to be? Or is there more to come? Todd Vasos : Scot, we -- as you know, we are very diligent in our pricing and the way we look at pricing every 2 weeks on our top items. With the proactive strategic pricing investments that we made last year, we feel that we're in very, very good shape right now in pricing, matter of fact, as good as in any other time in the recent past. We will continue to watch prices as they maneuver from area to area. We look at it by DMA, so we know throughout the nation where pricing is. And there's always some pricing activity that happens in certain years, but we feel -- as we sit right now, we are very well positioned on pricing, but we'll continue to monitor it, so we offer our consumers that value that she's come to know from Dollar General. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it, that's helpful. And then just a quickie second one. Did you guys mention the deflation and SNAP impact in the quarter? John Garratt : Yes. In terms of deflation, as we said, we see the commodity deflation piece of it transitory. We did start to see some reduction in our average unit retail deflation as we went from Q3 to Q4. And as we look into this quarter, we expect to see -- have seen signs of commodity deflation waning, but it continues to be a headwind. But bear in mind, we will start to lap this jump last year as we work through Q2. In terms of SNAP, that continues to be a headwind as well. As you know, many of our customers utilize SNAP and other government assistance programs. And it does take time for them to adjust their budgets. So it still is an impact. We do believe customers are starting to adjust and normalize their spend, and we will start to lap the bulk of that impact as we work through Q2 as well. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Alan Rifkin : Todd, for the 17% of your stores where you made the pricing and marketing investments a few quarters ago, can you maybe shed some color on how that group of stores did relative to the corporate average in the quarter? And when might we expect an acceleration in that initiative since it sounds like it is producing results? Todd Vasos : Alan, what we saw -- and we look at it on a lot of different levels. The great thing is we saw sales, we saw traffic as well as our gross margin dollars all increase in those stores in aggregate since we've rolled out these pricing investments. And I could tell you that in these stores, these stores that performed better than the chain average over the time that we've rolled those out, and say that we've said from the beginning that we'll continue to watch and monitor price. And if we feel we need to take further pricing actions, the great thing is we have this model to be able to springboard on. At this point, we don't see a further action needed because we're priced very, very aggressively in most of our areas today, if not all. And we feel that right now, we're in a real good spot. But we always reserve the right to make sure that -- we make sure we deliver that value to the convenience -- and convenience to our consumer. And over time, we may need to deploy further price. But at this time, we think we're in great shape on that proactive pricing that we took advantage of earlier on. Alan Rifkin : Okay. And my second question has to do with the long-term growth model. In the past, you were talking about 10% to 15% growth. Now we're talking about 10% or higher. So you've kind of eliminated the higher end of the band. Is that a function of just higher wage rates on your part that you believe will be persistent? Or is it also a function perhaps of increased competition over the longer term? Curious why you're taking down the high end of the range. John Garratt : Yes. Well, I'll start by saying that we feel good about this year's performance, delivering over 10% earnings per share growth, following double-digit earnings per share growth last year. And we're really trying to focus on the long term and make sure that we're making the right investments for the long term. In terms of this year, we did mention that we're investing for the long term and have some headwinds, which takes us outside of the model. And as such, we're not talking about this year in the context of the model. But again, our focus is on the business fundamentals, which remains phenomenal with great level economics that remain unchanged. And our focus, our goal remains to drive 10% or more earnings per share growth over the long term. But as we go through time, making sure we make investments as needed, so a sustainable growth. So as long as we're delivering double-digit earnings per share growth, we think we're serving our investors well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So Todd, a couple of things in one. Just to touch on again the timetable for the produce rollout. You said 1/3 of stores, but just what's the magnitude and then maybe beyond this initial test? When you think about what more you can do with a 7,300-square-foot box that would make you more like DG market, is there a lot more that can migrate and maybe even assortment in dry grocery? And then where does DG market stand, right? Is that ever likely to be accelerated or it's kind of what it is, kind of a test kitchen, if you will? Todd Vasos : Yes. John, let me first start by talking about the produce. As you may recall from the last call, we talked about testing produce in our 7,300 square foot stores. That test is ongoing. And due to that test as well as the stores that we took over from the Walmart Express stores, if you will, we're going to take about 1/3 of our smaller box remodels next year and put produce into those. So that's that 6,000-square-foot store. We believe, because where our consumer is moving toward more of a fresh alternative, including better for you and healthier for you, we believe this is the right thing to do. But as you know us pretty well, we're going to do this very methodically and we're going to ensure that we have a return against this so that we can scale it across many more stores. So we're going to go a little bit slow to make sure it works out the way we anticipate it working. Early results are showing some real positive signs, but again, they are really early results. In talking about DG market, we continue to be happy with the progress we're -- that we've got in our DG markets. Our sales comps are in line with our chain. Our margin expectations are good. We're using DG market a little bit differently right now, but reserve the right to look at it a little differently later. But right now, we're looking at it as a true test kitchen, if you will, for our DG Plus formats as well as our traditional format. I don't think we would ever be thinking about produce and meats in smaller stores if it wasn't for having the capability of DG market, as an example. So it's a great launching pad for a lot of other pieces that can go into, and your last point being that smaller store. And we believe that there's still a lot of opportunity for us in and around that food arena, whether it be dry grocery or perishables in our smaller box. As that consumer's preference continues to evolve over time, you know us pretty well, we evolve with her. And that's the great thing about having these different formats, we have the test-and-learns already done and available to roll out as those preferences change. So we feel good about where we are and where we're headed. And we'll be right in lock-step with the consumer. John Heinbockel : Maybe just give us a quick follow-up, right, if you -- when you think about maybe evolving more DG market into a core box, how much general merchandise do you need to have to be differentiated versus other competitors? Because you don't want to go too far in that regard, right? Todd Vasos : Yes, exactly right. And as we've always said, nonconsumables really rounds out the basket for us. And it obviously, as we know, works that gross margin line pretty nicely for us. But again, as the consumer changes, so does their preferences for nonconsumables, and we continue to evolve our nonconsumable offering as well. And we believe that we have real opportunities in seasonal and home categories that really resonate well with our core consumer. A party and occasions really resonate well in our core consumers' wallet as well. So we believe we've got opportunities to continue to grow. And as we talked about our strategic initiatives, I could tell you that, that's in focus for us strategically over the long term on how to -- how we look at our nonconsumable business for the long haul here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vinny Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Wanted to ask on the expense side of the business, just any update on zero-based budgeting. And then also if you could give any further color around the store manager, kind of the data behind the compensation decision. Is it largely in response to minimum wage changes? Or what other factors might you be able to kind of share with us behind that? John Garratt : I'll take the first part of that question. In terms of zero-based budgeting efforts, we're very pleased with the efforts, came out of the gate very strong on this. And as you saw with the SG&A, nearly leveraged SG&A at that comp of 0.9%, so exceeded our expectations. It's really become ingrained in the way we operate here. We've always had a culture of cost discipline here. But as Todd mentioned the filters, I see everyone in this organization looking at all the spend in terms of the customer, the strategic priorities and the business risk. And with that targeted focus on spending, I think that was a key contributor to the great cost discipline and performance we saw this year. Looking ahead, we continue to have the rigor of place around zero-based budgeting. The teams continue to work very hard on building a pipeline of future savings while making targeted investments as needed. And then also, we look at it broadly in terms of operating margin, managing all the levers within not only SG&A with the latest tools, zero-based budgeting, but also all the levers available to us within gross margin. Todd Vasos : Yes. Vinny, when you look at the store manager pay initiatives that we've outlined, the great thing about Dollar General is that we don't do anything blindly here, right? So if you look back to mid last year, we took a large group of stores, and we instituted a new pay scale for them, even outside of what the government was looking at rolling out at the time. And we wanted to see how those stores would perform over time, and if we could move the needle on sales as well as our turnover rates, both in our store manager turnover as well as our hourly turnover rates and if shrink over time would be able to benefit from this as well. The great news is we've seen sales increases. We've seen stability in our store managers, the turnover rate, and we've even seen stability in our hourly turnover rate in those stores as well to a greater degree. The great thing about this, the little difference in the government program -- it's not a one-size-fits-all program. It was really designed to best fit our store managers and the areas that they operate in as well as the complexity of their individual stores. So this has really been well designed. Our store operations team did a great job in putting this together. And I could tell you that we've already rolled it out to our stores, and it's been very, very well received as you can imagine. So we're looking for great things in the future to continue to happen both on the top line as well as our turnover lines in our stores from this initiative. Vincent Sinisi : Very helpful color. And maybe just a fast follow-up, just general kind of qualitative thoughts on the low-end consumer. I know I think it was like 2 quarters ago maybe you had said kind of a bit more cautious today. You said you kind of feel cautiously optimistic. Just kind of any underlying thoughts for the 2017 outlook on the low end? Todd Vasos : Thank you, Vinny. I think when you look at our core consumer, as we said, they're always a little bit stretched. I mean, that's just how they live. In saying that, we go out to our customers quite frequently. We just got a report back that really addresses your comment pretty well. And here's what the customer sentiment is right now. If -- you know what, I feel a little bit better about the way things are. The only thing is my finances aren't any better. And so it's not allowing me to take that next step in freely spending a little bit more because I have so many other headwinds in front of me and also some unknown around health care, as an example, around rents and a lot of the other things that are headwinds. The great thing about Dollar General is we are uniquely positioned to help her. And I think that as we look over the long term, making sure we're there with the right price and convenience at the right item for our consumer is going to be the win-win that she needs to continue to pull that budget together for her families. We feel good about where we are with the consumer, and we'll do everything we can to help that consumer be able to stem any tide that she may feel that maybe going against her at this time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research. John Zolidis : Nice results in a tough environment. I have a question about the gross margin outlook, which is embedded in the guidance. You didn't comment on it, and working through the midpoint of the other metrics, what you did provide, I'm coming up with approximately 30 basis points of pressure. I guess, as we look forward to next year, you have freight cost up, you have consumable shift. You saw some deflation in price investment. In the fourth quarter, that was offset by higher initial markup. So as we're looking into next year, what should we be modeling and thinking about the gross -- for the gross margin line? John Garratt : Yes. Well, I'll start by saying that we're -- yes, we really look at gross margin and SG&A in tandem and look to make the right trade-offs between both of those for the long term and do make sure that we protect our low-cost positioning as well as our everyday low prices. And as we mentioned at the outset, given that this year's a little bit different in terms of the model, we weren't planning to go through all the elements of the growth model in the context of 2017. But I will tell you, over the long term, while it's always competitive in retail, the team does a phenomenal job controlling what they can control. And over the long term, we continue to see opportunities to increase margin with all the levers available to us. We continue to see opportunity to improve shrink over time, continue to see opportunities and drive opportunities with supply chain efficiencies, continue to see private label and foreign sourcing penetrations opportunity, and the team continues to do a phenomenal job with category management. So that's really how we look at managing all the levers within operating margin to grow that over the long term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Todd, as you skew more towards fresh products, meat, produce, dairy, does that put you more in the competitive crosshair of the hard discounters? Or is the view -- you're already competing aggressively against those players, and so skewing more towards that assortment won't really matter? Todd Vasos : Yes. Michael, the competitive environment is always stiff out there. And we do compete with those competitors today. The way we look at this is whatever our customer is asking for, we want to make available to her in a very convenient store base as well as at a great price. And we see the opportunity in fresh and frozen to being able to be able to give her what she needs at the time she needs it. So I would tell you that while we do know that our competitors sell a lot of the same type of goods, we have a real competitive advantage and we own that last mile, right? And that last mile is being close to her doorstep at home. And there's -- nothing really trumps that convenient factor that we can offer other than price, and the nice thing is we have both. Michael Lasser : And Todd, I want to follow up on your comments around being comfortable with where your pricing is right now. Does that assume that market-level prices stay the same and then you might have to react if prices come down? Or you're comfortable with where they're at, where prices are and you're not assuming they're going to go lower? Todd Vasos : Yes, I would never assume that they won't go lower. We look at pricing now and where we think pricing may go as I made these comments. So we feel good about where we are today, and we feel good about the flexibility that we have in our model to be able to price where we need to take price across the DMAs that we operate in. But the great thing is we've never lost sight of price here. And by not losing sight of price, we don't believe it's ever going to be a hard left or a hard right we're going to have to take on pricing. We feel that we're very competitive now, and we can continue to be very competitive into -- no matter what may face us in the future. Michael Lasser : And if I could just add one more quick one because I think we're going to talk a lot about it for the next couple of months. You mentioned that as tax refunds were delayed, it probably caused some sluggishness in the first part of your quarter. Because over the course -- full course of your quarter, all the refunds that were distributed last year should be distributed this year. Do you think you get all of that back? Or is some of that spending maybe just leaked to other buckets and as a result, it won't be a full net-net impact here as well? Todd Vasos : Well, as you look at the tax refunds, you could definitely tell early in the quarter, John, indicated -- we saw some general softness around not having those tax returns out there. We saw a pickup as they started to flow. But I have to remind you, we got a lot of time left in the quarter still. Those tax returns, while flowing, aren't yet completely caught up, but they're getting closer. And I'm a retailer and as a retailer, when you move through certain periods of time and you don't get what you thought you were going to get, you don't bank that it's going to come. And what you do is you put initiatives in place as we did to capture a greater share of these tax returns as we move through the quarter. So we've done some things here to hopefully capture a greater share of those tax returns as she's ready to spend them. But I just want to say, we still have a lot of the quarter left. Remember that Easter shift that's occurring between March and April this year. And as we move into April, we're looking for some increased sales and hopefully deliver a pretty good quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : I wanted to ask you about -- back to store managers. You're seeing some earnings pressure because of proactive investments in wages and training. Assuming 20% or so annual store manager turnover, 1,000 new stores, you're going to have to hire and train something like 4,000 store managers this year. So how much of this wage increase and pressure just relates to finding good people? How are you finding that? And then how is this dynamic impacting the execution risk associated with your growth plan? Todd Vasos : Yes. That's a good question, Ed. As you look at our store manager, the one great thing over the last couple of years is that we've been dealing with this turnover in about the same rate for quite a while now. And our pipeline for good, talented store managers has not let up. We've been able to fill that pipeline, and we continue to be able to fill that pipeline. This investment is not really geared towards that as much because we can't [ph] find. It's more geared towards making sure that we take care of our current store managers. But also making sure that we continue to be able to retain and attract the right individuals as we go forward. So I think it's really twofold. But as we look at it, we feel very good about being able to attract and retain good talented individuals. And this test that we did back midyear last year and still ongoing, has really proven to show us that we can really stem the tide of turnover by getting that right individual on the front side into our stores to run that. The store -- being an old operator as I am, the store manager is the key linchpin to everything that happens at retail, always has been, and at least probably in my lifetime as a retailer, always will be. Edward Kelly : Great. That makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up, of the $0.16, how much of that relates to what you're doing with store manager pay? John Garratt : That's the vast majority of it. Yes, there was also the training went with it, but the bulk of it was the store manager investment. Mary Winn Pilkington : Kayla, we've hit the top of the hour, so I think we'll end it there. To everyone, thank you for joining us on the call. And for those that we've left in the queue, please know Matt and I are around and look forward to speaking to you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those projected by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, under Risk Factors in our 2016 Form 10-K filed on March 24, 2017, and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call, except as may be otherwise required by law.  Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Mary Winn, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I am pleased with the way the team managed through the ongoing tough environment across retail during the first quarter : successfully controlling what we can control. Even as we lapped our most challenging sales and earning results from last year, our earnings per share reflected solid management of the business. In the first quarter, we made progress on the implementation of our key initiatives for the year as we seek to capture growth opportunities over both the long and short term. As we shared with you last quarter, our SG&A investments in 2017 are primarily focused on an increased compensation structure and additional training for our store managers as they play a critical role in our customer experience and the profitability of each store. The team is working to refine and execute our long-term strategy framework that we believe will help to differentiate us from the competition over time.  Let us recap some of the financial results for the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016 quarter. First quarter net sales increased 6.5% to $5.6 billion. Same-store sales grew 0.7% for the quarter. Our same-store sales improved as we moved past the combined effect of the delay in the income tax refunds and the timing shift of a later Easter holiday, both factors we mentioned on our last call. Same-store sales growth was driven by consumables and apparel, offset by declines in seasonal and home categories. Operating profit was $474 million. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share was $1.02, including approximately $0.01 charge for the early retirement of debt. We continue to increase our overall market share in highly consumables, growing mid-single digits based on the most recent syndicated data over 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending May 6, 2017.  We continue to believe many of the headwinds we faced in 2016 and are continuing to face are transitory in nature, such as the impact of average unit retail price deflation as well as customer behavior that we believe to be associated with changes to the federal SNAP benefits program. Average unit retail price deflation from the combination of lower commodity cost and promotional activity, along with the reduction of SNAP benefits, continued to weigh on our same-store sales performance in the quarter. As we look ahead, we anticipate lapping some of these effects in the second half of the year.  As John will discuss later in the call, we are confirming our 2017 diluted EPS guidance of $4.25 to $4.50. Our objective remains to provide our customers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most.  The team is focused on moving the business forward. During the quarter, we entered into an agreement to purchase 322 store sites located across 36 states from a small-box, multi-price point retailer. The transaction, which was approved by the Federal Trade Commission in April of 2017, is expected to close this month with conversions to the Dollar General banner completed by the end of November. Most of these stores are located in metro areas where we had anticipated future growth for Dollar General, and this pending transaction will allow us to expand in some of these markets at an accelerated pace. After John reviews additional financial highlights for the quarter and our full year guidance, I will update you on our operating priorities and anticipated integration plans for the store sites that we expect to purchase in June.  Now let me turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our first quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.7 billion or 30.3% of sales, a decrease of 34 basis points from last year's first quarter. The most significant drivers were higher markdowns, primarily for inventory clearance and promotional activities; a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories; and the mix within consumables. These factors were partially offset by higher initial markups on inventory purchases.  SG&A expense increased by 34 basis points over the 2016 quarter to $1.2 billion or 21.8% of sales in the first quarter. The majority of the SG&A increase was due to retail labor, primarily our investment in store manager pay and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these items were reduction in advertising costs, including improvements in our advertising efficiencies and lower waste management costs related to our recycling efforts. Even as we made strategic SG&A investments in our business, we exhibited good underlying expense control discipline.  Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.2% as compared to 35.4% in the first quarter last year. Our effective income tax rate was higher this quarter due primarily to the recognition of a tax benefit of approximately $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share in the 2016 first quarter associated with stock-based compensation that did not reoccur in this quarter.  Now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.3 billion, an increase of 0.5% on a per store basis from the 2016 first quarter. We believe our inventory is in good shape, and we are comfortable with its quality. We generated cash from operations of $510 million in the quarter, an increase of 26% or $107 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. While just over half of this increase is due to the timing of income tax payments shifting from the first quarter to the second quarter as compared to 2016, we continue to have strong underlying performance in our cash from operations. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend program while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation and our investment-grade rating. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock for $89 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per common share outstanding, totaling $71 million. Since December 2011 through the end of the first quarter of 2017, we repurchased $4.7 billion or 75.6 million shares of our common stock. As of the end of the first quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $845 million.  Looking ahead, I thought it would be helpful to share with you some key highlights of our anticipated store site purchase that Todd mentioned earlier. The transaction is forecast to be modestly accretive to net sales and earnings in fiscal 2017. We expect to incur charges and related expenses associated with the conversion of acquired store locations to the Dollar General banner, which we anticipate will be completed by November 2017. These expenses will be primarily related to lease termination costs for a small number of overlapping store locations as well as additional costs related to the pending store locations. We currently anticipate the charge will be approximately $0.02 per share in the 2017 second quarter. Based on our expectations regarding the timing of both the closing of the transaction and the conversion of the sites to the Dollar General banner, we estimate that the acquired sites will add about 100 basis points to our fiscal 2017 net sales growth. Please keep in mind, the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. Let's now turn to guidance, which includes the anticipated impact of the pending transaction that I just discussed. Net sales are forecasted to increase by approximately 5% to 7% as compared with our prior guidance range of 4% to 6%. Our forecast for growth in same-store sales is consistent with our prior guidance range of slightly positive to up 2%. We continue to forecast GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.50, including modest net accretion from the pending store site acquisition I discussed a moment ago. Capital spending is forecasted to be in the range of $715 million to $765 million, an increase of $65 million from our previous outlook. This increase is related primarily to the conversion of the pending acquisition sites.  Taking into account the pending acquisition sites for 2017, we now plan to open about 1,290 new stores and to reduce our total fiscal 2017 remodels, relocations by about 140 sites to a total of 760 stores to allow for organizational capacity to execute the incremental new store growth anticipated to result from this transaction. In total, the team expects to execute about 2,050 real estate projects in 2017.  Our share repurchase guidance for fiscal 2017 remains unchanged at approximately $450 million.  As you model the balance of 2017, please keep in mind the following : While the sales environment for retail continues to be choppy, we are working aggressively to improve our customer traffic, and we believe that we will see positive traffic in the second quarter. We anticipate the mix shift of sales to consumables and the negative mix within consumables that we experienced in the first quarter to continue and modestly accelerate in the 2017 second quarter. We believe that our customer will require sustained improvement in her economic outlook before she is willing to increase her spending on discretionary nonconsumable items. As you look at the quarterly cadence, both our margin and EPS comparisons to the prior year comparable periods begin to ease in the 2017 third quarter.  In closing, we will continue to focus on the things that are within our control, including managing our working capital and always striving to be a low-cost operator. We will also be financially disciplined in our capital allocation. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you. As John mentioned, we remain focused on capturing long-term opportunities ahead. In March, I went into some detail on the work that we did to advance our business through a comprehensive strategic review. We are refining and executing on the plans that resulted from our strategic review of the business, focusing on the actions that we anticipate will have the greatest potential to drive shareholder value over the longer term. We are well into the process of staffing the strategy group, along with the dedicated business leaders and teams that will execute on the initiatives. These plans are a very exciting part of evolving our business, and we believe they will help us remain well positioned to capture market share in a changing retail landscape.  We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. Our ongoing operating priorities remain : first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.  Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. In spite of the challenging retail environment, we look to attract and grow new customers and trips and capture share with existing customers. This includes expanding the merchandising initiatives in our existing stores to drive traffic into those stores and improve same-store sales. Merchandising initiatives across all 4 product categories are being executed in a select group of stores to provide consumers with more of the products and brands they want and need to save time and money every day. The vast majority of these initiatives for fiscal 2017 are either completed or expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter. For those that we have completed, the initiatives are performing at/or above our expectations. One of the most exciting merchandising changes that we have made is in health and beauty, where we have a significant opportunity to increase our share of wallet with our customers through trial and conversion. In beauty, we have redesigned the cosmetic area in the vast majority of our stores to showcase the breadth of on-trend products that we offer at compelling price points. While this reset has recently been executed across nearly 12,000 sites, we are seeing improvement in our same-store sales. More planogram changes and visual excitement will be coming to our health categories as well as we look to increase our offering of value-added differentiated products with a focus on health and wellness, nutrition and personal care. Across merchandising categories, we believe that our planogram changes should continue to build momentum as we move through the year. The remodeling of about 300 traditional stores based on lessons learned from the conversion of acquired sites last year is on track as well. The remodels include increasing the cooler set to 34 doors, an increase of about 160% on average from the existing cooler footprint for these locations. This allows for a greater perishable assortment, which helps drive trips and basket size. Additionally, across about 1/3 of the -- of these locations, we are testing assortment of fresh produce. While it is still very early, initial remodels are yielding strong same-store sales improvements. We are strategically investing in a portion of the existing store base that has been opened for 5 years or more that we often refer to as our mature store base. We are particularly focused on stores that have fewer than 10 cooler doors, which in relative terms are expected to drive the highest returns. By the end of 2017, we anticipate that across our store base, we will have an average of 17 cooler doors, up from 10 in 2012. Year-to-date, more than 11,500 cooler doors have been installed across the chain for these locations. We are seeing an improvement in transactions. On the customer side, we are seeing continued opportunity to improve engagement and build loyalty through further integration of our traditional and digital media mix. Our plan is to reach our consumers where, when and how they decide to engage with us. We are also leveraging in-store operational initiatives such as improving our customer experience and our in-stock position. The store operations team has an ongoing intensive effort to improve our in-stocks through training and technology as product availability is an important driver of our customer satisfaction. We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion through improvements in shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution and transportation efficiencies and nonconsumable sales. As always, we will continue to work to ensure that our value proposition resonates with our customers. We are committed to providing them with everyday low prices that they know and trust from us. Our goal is to ensure we are highly relevant for our customers through our ongoing price investment in everyday low price and targeted promotional activity.  We have consistently shared with you one of the keys to our business is growing transactions and units. Our pricing surveys continue to indicate that Dollar General is very well positioned against all classes of trade and across all geographic regions. We are committed to being priced right for our customers to drive traffic to our stores.  Our focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities is our second priority. We have a proven, high-return, low-risk model that our real estate -- which is our real estate growth. We believe that we can extend this model to the opportunistic purchases of the 322 sites. These sites are highly complementary to our long-term new store growth plans with about 85% located in metro areas. The majority of these sites are in strategic trade areas that we would have anticipated for new store site selection over time. This transaction would allow us to reach certain of these areas faster and potentially more economically with organic growth. We will look to build out these sites. The range of different DG store formats is a strength that we can leverage based on the marketplace, along with the opportunity to test new ideas.  Our existing plans for 2017 new store growth remains on track with the goal to make the pending sites as accretive as possible to our new store locations. The 1,000 new stores anticipated when we announced 2016 year-end earnings are in the pipeline for fiscal 2017. As John discussed, we expect the transaction to bring our new store count for 2017 to 1,290. We believe we continue to have first-mover advantage to secure best sites while driving compelling new store average returns of approximately 20%.  New store productivity and returns are metrics we constantly monitor to ensure our new store growth is best use of our capital. I continue to be very pleased with our new store returns. The metrics we use to evaluate our real estate portfolio of new stores include : one, new store productivity as a percent of our comp store sales; second, actual sales performance compared to our pro forma model; third, returns of about 18% to 20%; fourth, cannibalization of our new stores on our comp store base; and finally, a payback period of less than 2 years. Regardless of the metric, over time, we have seen very consistent performance from our new stores. Given the softness across retail, I am pleased with how our new stores are performing. We are committed to ensuring we are deploying our capital effectively to drive strong financial returns for the long term.  Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending. All of our spending is filtered through 3 criteria : first, is it customer facing; second, does it align with our strategic priorities; and finally, third, how does it impact our risk profile.  In our stores, we are focused on simplifying our operations by reducing inventory, product movement within the stores and operating complexity, so our store managers and their teams can reinvest time savings to provide better customer service and a clean in-stock shopping experience for our customers. At the store support center, work elimination and process improvement are ongoing efforts to take cost out of the business.  Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always seek to be a low-cost operator. Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe that they are a competitive advantage. As we entered 2017, we made significant investments in compensation and training for our store managers. Our data-driven approach to store manager compensation segments our stores based on the labor market data and store-level complexity. Across our existing store managers, internal promotions and external hires, we are targeting our investments to drive results. Overall, while it's still very early, the strategy for putting the investments to work in the marketplace is off to a good start. For existing store managers, we have seen an improvement of more than 400 basis points for voluntary turnover since making the compensation investment. While internal promotions continue to be a great source of store managers who know our culture and processes, we have been able to attract experienced retail individuals from sectors of retail that assimilate well to our model and culture. The stores with these new external hires are seeing improved results in associate turnover and positive impacts to same-store sales. Our organization's capacity to focus on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication are critical to this investment paying off over time. As I have traveled to our store locations with our field leadership, the feedback and interaction with our store managers on our investment has been extremely positive. The customer experience and the profitability of our stores should benefit over time from this investment given how important the leadership of store manager is to these metrics. Our early progress is encouraging.  This year, we are on track to create more than 10,000 new jobs as a result of our planned new store openings and 2 new state-of-the-art distribution centers. These new jobs help provide our employees with great career growth. We expect to invest more than 1.5 million training hours in employees in 2017 to promote education and development as we look to use our robust and best-in-class training programs to support our commitment to invest in our people and our employees as a competitive advantage. As our -- as for our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions but acknowledge that for our core customer, it is always challenging given the pressures on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our customers, we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General.  We are committed to the long-term growth and to the creation of shareholder value. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through our cash -- through our share repurchase program and anticipated dividends.  To the more than 122,000 employees of Dollar General, I want to thank you for your efforts to put our customers at the center of all we do. With that, Mary Winn, we would like to now open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Just wanted to ask about the traffic. I know you said that you're expecting it to turn positive in 2Q. But just wanted to see if you could give us maybe a little bit more color on kind of the thoughts behind it and some of those headwinds like you had mentioned being more transitory in nature, particularly as you're kind of lapping SNAP and more so if you're seeing any changes on the promotional environment, in particular to some of your traffic-driving items that have been deflationary, that would be great. Todd Vasos : Sure. First of all, we're very, very confident in what we see coming out of our initiatives for 2017. The early results of the initiatives that we put in place in Q1 that have also -- being put in place so far in Q2 have been very positive. Health and beauty, we called out in the prepared remarks, I'm very encouraged in seeing that. And I'm very encouraged as well in the big traffic-driving areas of our coolers and our perishable-type items. We've added more than 11,000 cooler doors so far, and we've got a lot more yet to do as we work through this quarter and even into Q3 on many of those initiatives. So we're very, very confident in what we see so far that it should help us continue to drive traffic as we move to the back half of the year. As far as what we're seeing in some of those transitory-type items, we're seeing deflation start to moderate. As we move through Q1, deflationary pressures from a cost input standpoint, we did see some moderation. We're not seeing a lot of inflation, but we're not seeing a lot of further deflation either. So it gives us confidence as we move through Q2 -- and keep in mind, Q3 -- we saw a pretty big deflationary time. But as we get past Q3, those should really start to roll off at least based on what we see today. And as we look at our SNAP piece that really we start to cycle here in the next month or so, we're already seeing some effects of that cycling since the waiver is sort of waived-in, if you will, by state. And right now, we've actually seen where we had been running about 100 basis point difference in our comp sales performance in those SNAP-affected states versus our other states that we operate in. That has now been cut in half. We're now seeing about 50 basis points of difference. So we're already starting to see that moderation, and I believe we'll continue to see that as we move through Q2. And then lastly, your question on the promotional environment. Promotionally, we're really seeing about the same that we saw coming out of Q4. Q1 has been about the same. We're really not seeing a big difference. There's some pockets here and there of activity. But overall, we feel very confident about our promotional activity. But as you know, we're more squarely focused on our everyday low prices here. And there, we really feel good about where we are. Our everyday low prices are in the best shape that I think I've seen it in the close to 9 years that I've been here across all geographic areas, so we feel very good about that as well as we move through and into the second part of the year. Vincent Sinisi : Super helpful. And just a fast follow-up. We, on the phone -- I'm sure, get asked this all the time. When we get asked -- you guys had set out some kind of longer-term financial growth metrics. I guess, it was earlier last year. We know obviously the macro changes this year, investing in store manager comp and all that stuff. Do you still, though, feel good in a more kind of normalized operating environment of the metrics that you did lay out last year? John Garratt : Yes. We still feel good about the fundamentals of the business and the long-term growth potential. It's still our goal to be a 10% grower in the long term. As we look at the business, we still see a tremendous amount of organic growth opportunity, great store-level economics, still getting the 20% return on new store openings, and very excited about the additional acquired stores this year that gets us into places we wanted to go, continue to generate a tremendous amount of cash. We mentioned 26% cash growth even when you strip out some timing with taxes, it was still double-digit cash flow growth this quarter. So we continue to see a tremendous runway for growth. We're excited about the initiatives we have in place. We feel we're in a good position from a pricing standpoint. We believe that our combination of value, convenience really resonates with our customer and allows us to continue to grow share. And we continue to have a lot of levers within gross margin and SG&A that the team does a phenomenal job managing and has a great track record of making the right trade-offs, but with an eye on the long term and investing where we need to as we have this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Can you give us a little more flavor for how trends unfolded over the course of the quarter? With the drag from the tax refunds, our sense is you're probably negative. And then by the end of the quarter, you were obviously nicely positive given where the full quarter ended up. Was that solely due to the tax refund drag going away and then the SNAP drag becoming less of an issue? Or were you able to definitively tie some performance results to the initiatives that you had put in place? Todd Vasos : Yes. That's a great question. We saw the quarter unfolding this way : As we said in our prepared remarks, once we got past that delay in the income tax piece -- and remember, also, Easter shifted from March to April this year. Once we got past that combined Easter shift and the tax refund delay, we did see a nice uptick as we got into April. Even beyond the Easter shift, we saw that occur. And I think it is a combination of many things. But I again, feel very confident in our initiatives. We could really tie directly a lot of what we saw coming into April because that's when some of our initiatives really started to take hold, we could really tie directly some of our performance into that. While we're not happy or satisfied with 70 basis points of comp, we know that we could grow that a lot more over time here. I think in this environment, I think we laid a comp on the table that was very competitive but with an eye on growing that a lot more as we move to the back half of the year. Michael Lasser : And then, Todd, my follow-up question is on the merchandise mix that's being sold. Do you think you're seeing an economic drag, maybe a post-cyclical drag on some of those discretionary categories where consumers might be trading to other retailers as a result of a stable or benign economic period and the potential for those to get better in a more challenging environment? Or is there some influence you can have over the discretionary categories such that those areas can improve independent of the macro? Todd Vasos : As you look at our discretionary categories, prior to Q2 of last year, we had some very nice growth over -- about 6 to 8 quarters. We believe it's transitory in nature right now. We believe for a lot of reasons, the customer has been pulling back, been holding back a little bit. Matter of fact, we don't believe she's been trading out at all. What we see from our customer data is some of our stronger comps and stronger sales are coming from not only our very strong customers, but that next level-up, which would have a tendency and propensity to trade out over time, but actually have been our strongest in Q1, our strongest sales driver category of consumer. So I don't believe she's been trading out. I just believe that she's in an economic cycle right now where there's a little bit of uncertainty and a little bit of a holdback on these discretionary items. And I believe and feel very confident in what the team has built here on the category management side to take advantage as soon as she starts to loosen the purse strings up a little bit on that nonconsumable side of the business. But to really look at it the proper way, we had a very strong Easter. Matter of fact, Easter was as strong as we've seen in the last couple, 3 years. So it gives us a lot of solace that our nonconsumable businesses as well as many of our consumable businesses that we have are trending in the right direction. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : Just to follow up on that last answer regarding the challenging environment. I guess, Todd, what do you think you need to see with the economy at this point in order for your customer to loosen up the purse strings? Todd Vasos : Yes. What I think we need to see is a little bit more confidence in what we're -- what the consumer is seeing today from job growth and wage growth, will it be sustainable? I think that's the big ticket right now that we're waiting to happen, I think that they're waiting to see happen. Our core customer, as you know, doesn't have large bank accounts to fall back on. And so [ during ] times like these where she's starting to feel a little bit more comfortable because she's back to work and seeing a little bit of wage growth, she wants to make sure it's sustainable. The huge downturn that we all experienced in 2008, 2009, hit our consumer extremely hard, probably the hardest of any group that was out there. And I think that's still very fresh in her mind. So she's making sure that what she's seeing now is sustainable and can grow over time. And I believe once that happens, we'll start to see that purse string loosen. Peter Keith : Okay. Maybe on a similar note then, you talked about the discretionary business being a little bit weak starting with Q2 last year. I would think discretionary within your mix would be the area that's most at risk to losing share to e-comm, certainly more so than consumables. Do you have a perspective on your positioning with e-comm today and if there is potential encroachment? Todd Vasos : Yes. We see e-commerce about where we had seen it coming out of Q4. Our core customer is a fast follower. There is no doubt. Only about 70% of them today have cell phones -- excuse me, smartphones. And I believe that over time, she will probably start to gravitate a little bit more toward online purchasing. But today, all of our work shows that she is still lagging there compared to the rest of the customers in the economy that's out there. In saying that, we're working very diligently here as well. Part of our strategic review, as we mentioned, was digital. And we're working hard to ensure that as our core customer starts to gravitate more and more to digital that we're going to be able to take her along the journey with us, and she'll look to us for her future digital needs like many others do, other retailers, both online as well as brick-and-mortar retailers today. So I don't see that today, though, that our core customer is spending a lot more of her disposable income online than she did before. We just don't see that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So on category drivers, I guess, how much do you believe tax refunds drove the mix shift towards consumables in the first quarter? And I guess, to go back to some of the comments you had earlier, what's driving the mix shift acceleration into the second quarter? And within the consumables, I think there was some talk about more micro-category -- an intra-category shift between food and nonfood. Just if you can parse through some of the 1Q versus what's continuing into 2Q and what you're seeing in that category. Todd Vasos : Yes, sure. As we look at the tax refunds, and I think others have said the same thing, once you don't have that same refund at the same time, you never seem to get back all those sales that seem to not be there, right? Now we got our fair share, I think, of what came, but it just wasn't to the extent I believe that it would have been if it came on time. Now in saying that, the majority of those sales normally -- because it's tax refund in nature, usually does come in our discretionary categories. So it did slow our discretionary a little bit more than what we had anticipated in Q1. What we're seeing, though, as we move into Q2, is the continuation of what we saw really in Q1, and that's the consumer really holding onto her money, spending where her need is the most. And that's been on the consumable side of the businesses. And then even within that, we're seeing some mix shift inside of the categories. We're driving the mix to some less profitable areas as well within categories. So that continues to be there. The great thing is we have a great category management team that's able to watch and see what's happening and then be able to react to that. So that as we continue to move through Q2 then into the back half of the year, make adjustments. And those adjustments -- and we're used to doing this. We do it very well, make those adjustments to work that margin depending on the way the consumer is shopping. This isn't anything new. We've been doing this for many, many years, and we know how to do it pretty well. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow. Can you touch on the productivity and return metrics that you're seeing from some of your more recent classes of new stores? I guess, just more so, any perspective on what you're seeing from the latest classes versus historically some of the metrics that you had seen in the past? John Garratt : Yes. We continue to see consistent results. We walked you through the key metrics that we look at in terms of new store productivity, with that goal of as a percent of our comp store base being in that 80% to 85% range. We remain within there. We continue to see our actual sales performance compared to pro forma very close, it ebbs and flows from time to time, but hitting those pro formas pretty consistently over time. We continue to see -- track returns. We target 18% to 20%. We continue to see our returns tracking towards the high end of that range. We've not seen cannibalization move on it. It has been pretty consistent and what we expected. And we continue to see a payback period of less than 2 years. So really, we continue to see the same great results that we expect, consistent performance. And with that in mind, we're very bullish about the future of this. But obviously, we diligently track these, monitor them very closely. We're a nimble company that can make adjustments if needed down the road. But right now, what we're seeing, we like. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett. John Parke : This is actually John Parke on for Chuck. So I guess, first, I mean, what is the annualized lift that you guys expect to see to both sales and earnings from these stores that you're acquiring? John Garratt : In terms of lift, what we said there was we expected to drive 1 point of total sales growth. So as we had said in our guidance, we upped it from 4% to 6% to 5% to 7%. And then it doesn't show up in our comp base until next year, so there'll be no impact to the sales comp. John Parke : Okay. But there's no kind of guidance on what that does on an annual basis? John Garratt : So on an annual basis from a dollar amount, it's a little over $0.5 billion. John Parke : Got you. Okay. And then just switching gears a little bit. It seemed like new store productivity kind of spiked up a bit here in the quarter. I mean, are you guys doing anything different around your new store openings to kind of speak to that? Or... John Garratt : I think it just speaks to we have a tremendous real estate team that continues to hone that model. They do a phenomenal job of finding the best sites, and they continue to hone that algorithm, find the best sites, continue to optimize that box. I mean, we see ourselves as the innovator in different formats. And what we're finding is the right format that fits occasion and seeing good success in the smaller box, for instance, which opens up areas that weren't open to us in the past. So I think it's just a testament to the rigor and the capability of the team here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Just a question to clarify. Is traffic -- did traffic end on a positive note in the quarter? And is it positive into the second quarter? I just wanted to clarify that, and then I had another question. Todd Vasos : Sure. Traffic did spike up, obviously, in April. Combination of the Easter shift as well as our initiatives, I believe, drove that to positive. And we're not really talking too much about Q2 right now, but we saw some positive momentum coming into Q2, but it's still very early. So we don't want to comment on where we believe that's going to end up. But again, we're very, very confident in our initiatives to drive the top line. And we're looking forward in future quarters to see that traffic move to positive. Karen Short : Okay. And then you commented, I guess, that stores testing produce are seeing strong same-store sales. I'm just wondering if you could get a little more granular on what kind of comp lift you're seeing from this, and then maybe you could give a little color on how shrink is looking at those stores in particular. Todd Vasos : Yes. When you look at the stores that we put produce in, again, just keep in mind, it's a very few stores, but we have seen nice comp lifts in these stores. Now these same stores have been remodeled as well, so we're watching the comp across all categories within those stores. Produce is helping that comp. But even without that, those stores are comping very, very well. And it's really attributable to the amount of cooler doors we're putting in on the refrigerated and frozen side of that equation has been well received by the consumers. And we're starting to really see traffic start to pick up in those stores as word of mouth continues to get out that we've got a broader selection of things they need to include \"better for you type\" products within those coolers. So we're pretty excited about what we see there, but there's still a lot more yet to figure out on these new stores as it relates to produce. As you know, we've been in the produce business only a short period of time in these stores, but we've got a lot of experience with them in our market stores. And we've taken the learnings from those and applying them there. And then as far as the shrink in these stores, a little too early to tell yet. As you know, shrink has a pretty long tail to it. And since we've just been remodeling these stores recently, a real shrink indication probably won't be evident until probably latter part of this year in those stores to see exactly how they're starting to trend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal : So I guess, wanted to spend a sec just to understand kind of the analyses that you guys run around traffic to understand whether it's sort of exogenous or macro or competition. Specifically, I think I get it on the trade-up piece, but I wonder about replacement. How do you sort of analyze the idea that, well, maybe some low-end consumers are shopping at discount grocers or something like that more and maybe that's why we're seeing less trips, how do you get your head around that to get comfortable with what's going on there? Todd Vasos : Yes. The great thing about Dollar General is we do a tremendous amount of work with our customer. Each and every quarter, we reach out and touch our consumer to understand exactly what she's feeling, what she's seeing and what she's doing. We do it on a personal level, then we do it on a macro level as well. And what we see and what we've been seeing for the past 3 quarters, including Q1, has been a continued consolidation of her shopping patterns. Shopping less and shopping fewer retailers as she shops, so -- on both sides of that equation. So she is making decisions on where she shops. And as she does that, she's also making decisions that I'm going to shop a little less as well, meaning less frequently. So we watch that very carefully. While we have seen the same phenomenon in our business as others have seen based on all the work that we see, we actually have seen the rate of that consolidation quicken in other channels of trade versus ours, while we still -- while we have still seen a decrease in the amount of time that -- or amount of shops that she does in a month period, we're not seeing the contraction as deep as other classes of trade. But it still concerns us that she's contracting across the board. So that means that while she is shopping, we have to have the right items at the right time at the price to attract her, and that's what we're working on to make sure that happens. Stephen Tanal : Got it. That's helpful. I was wondering as well if you would quantify or comment on the uplift from the remodels to sort of the like-for-like box? John Garratt : Yes. We continue to see great performance from the remodels. What we've said in the past is in terms of a sales lift, we get about 4% to 5%. We continue to get that. And on some of the remodels where we're putting more coolers in, we're seeing a considerably higher lift on that. And we've been very pleased with what we've seen as we add coolers to the stores. Todd Vasos : Yes. When you take a look at our Dollar General traditional Plus stores that we're putting together, these ones that we're remodeling, we're seeing 3x the comp sales lift in those stores than we've seen from a traditional remodel. Remember, we've always said a traditional remodel runs between 4% and 5%. We're seeing 3x that lift from these. So we're very encouraged early on, on what we're seeing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Fletcher with Bernstein. Brandon Fletcher : Our only concern is what we like best about you guys is how defensible you are geographically. We love the more rural locations, especially because that's hard to replicate and with new distribution centers letting you run efficiencies further out. We think those stores are protected for a long run. Help us understand why you guys like the metro stores as much, especially if we imagine -- let's say, produce goes in there and I don't know what your strategy is for produce and I know it's evolving. But we just get nervous that if you have more metro stores and they're doing the same thing that a Lidl and an Aldi will do that competition gets really intense. So if we could have any color on your strategy around that, that would be very useful. Todd Vasos : Yes, absolutely. Those are great questions and it's things that we look at internally here all the time. One thing I think is important to keep in mind is not all metro locations are created equal. There are certain metro areas that actually feel and look more like our rural locations, let me explain, both from a customer standpoint as far as the demographic is concerned as well as from lack of competition. There is a lot of metro areas out there that we're looking at that we're actually opening as well as part of the 292 stores that we're going to be opening from our recent acquisitions, many of them are in these areas that have little competition in them as well because not every metro area has a great amount of competition. So we're very selective, and we've been watching this very carefully over time and feel confident that there's thousands of opportunities out there in metro that meet the criteria we need to be successful. So stay tuned, continue to watch. But we're watching it very carefully, and we're very happy with what we see early on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : Todd, so the first thing on the acquired stores. So the productivity is obviously very good because they're metro stores. How large is the gap in profitability, right, with maybe your overall base or your metro stores? Do you think you need to invest in price and labor in those stores because maybe that has not happened? And then what does this do to your expansion profile after 2017? Does it come down because you front loaded it somewhat here? Todd Vasos : As we look at it, John, these stores that we're acquiring -- again, top line as you indicated is pretty good. What I think they've been suffering from is really a lack of scale as it related to the profitability and watching it drop to the bottom as well as a lot of the know-how that we have on how to run stores from a shrink perspective. So we believe that the opportunity gap is very large on the profitability side. As we look at price, what we modeled in as we looked to purchase these is to get them more aligned with where Dollar General pricing is. So yes, the prices will come down in those areas, but they should because, again, we're all about making sure we drive traffic in units in there. And we believe that the $0.5 billion in sales that these stores are throwing off can also increase very profitably. So we think we've got opportunities both on top line as well as letting it fall right to the bottom line. John Heinbockel : And then just unrelated, I actually thought the discretionary performance in the fourth quarter was pretty good, right? One of your better ones in the last year, 1, 1.5 years in light of the macro environment, right? So maybe touch on that a little bit. And in particular, I was surprised apparel was as good as it was. Todd Vasos : Yes. As you said, John, while we're never happy with where we ended up there, we always think there's more, the team has done a great job in nonconsumables. And as you continue to look forward, I believe we've got the right product at the right price for what the consumer is looking for in nonconsumables. In saying that, apparel did do pretty well. As we move through Q1, I believe the lineup that we have for spring and summer is one of the best that we've seen. But also the transition out of Q4, which is more of our winter and fall-type goods, we were able to take advantage of that as well on the top line. With a little bit of a cooler, wetter start to the quarter 1 helped propel a little bit more of that and elongated out a little bit more of the winter goods as well. So we saw apparel benefit on both sides of that equation. And then lastly, I mentioned earlier, our seasonal business continues to do very well. And Easter was again one of our best in a couple, 3 years, and not only on consumable candy but also on our nonconsumable sides of seasonal. So we feel we're well positioned, but we're not going to rest until we see comps accelerate a lot more from where they are today in nonconsumables. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : I just wanted to get a little bit of handholding around the guidance, and I know you don't provide quarterly detail. But as we think about your first quarter metrics from a comp and margin standpoint, how should we think about the puts and takes and the opportunity for improvement in 2Q versus the second half, in particular on SG&A and gross margins. If you can give just a little bit more detail around how you're thinking about, again, merchandise mix, markdowns, need for further price investments. And then we haven't really touched so much on the expense front around ZBB and what you were able to execute in the first quarter. So some details on that front would be great. John Garratt : Okay. Well, starting with the overall guidance, that remained unchanged with GAAP EPS guidance remaining at $4.25 to $4.50. That is inclusive of the acquired stores. The thing we mentioned there was that, that will be modestly accretive for the year as we have expense in the front-end of that, about $0.02 in Q2, and then the back-ended loaded nature of the openings, we won't get a full year benefit. That will be toward the end of the year. The other thing we did mention is we continue to see the headwinds we saw in Q1, and the team did a phenomenal job working through that, but we continue to see those headwinds coming into Q2. And the other one we mentioned was mix. But as Todd said, we're comfortable with our ability through category management to improve that. And as we get through Q2, we'll have all our initiatives in place getting into the back half of the year as well as the thing we noted was in Q3 that's where you see the comps both from a top line and a bottom line ease. So we feel good as we get into back half of the year with those initiatives in place. With headwinds starting to subside and the comps easing, we feel good as we get into the back half of the year. But we stuck with the same guidance. There's still a lot of year left. Q1 came in about where we expected, so we thought we would keep the guidance where it's at for now, but very excited about the acquisition opportunity here and seeing over time that's going to be accretive to us. Mary Winn Pilkington : All right. Hope, so I think that will wrap up our call. I know we left a few people in the queue, and I do apologize about that. But please feel free to give me a call, and we look forward to updating you as we move forward. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the Dollar General First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. You may disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Hope, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, August 31, 2017. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded and instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning. Now I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference. Mary Winn Pilkington : Thank you, Hope, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and John Garratt, our CFO.

You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call except as maybe otherwise required by law. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Mary Winn, and welcome to everyone joining our call.  Before we begin our prepared remarks, our thoughts are with our employees, customers and the local communities impacted by the devastating damage caused by Hurricane Harvey and the record flooding across the region. Our primary concern continues to be the safety of our teams and helping our team members that have been displaced. Across Dollar General, it has been heartwarming to see the outpouring of support for the Gulf Coast region from our store support center, store operations and distribution and transportation networks.  Turning now to our results. I'm pleased with the strong same-store sales growth during the second quarter, which was driven by both customer basket and positive traffic. As we shared with you last quarter, we anticipated that our traffic would be positive for the second quarter. Our team's execution was strong and I anticipate we will be able to capitalize on the momentum in the business. In today's dynamic retail and consumer landscape, we continue to make targeted investments in our business to support our focused strategic and operating initiatives. We believe these investments will contribute to sustainable improvements over time.  As we have shared with you over the last several quarters, we continue to believe that the sales impact of certain headwinds we have been confronting are transitory such as average unit price deflation and customer behavior that we believe to be associated with changes to the federal SNAP benefits program. Although these macroeconomic headwinds continue to impact our same-store sales performance in the quarter, we believe that macroeconomic factors as a whole have less of an impact on our same-store sales than in recent quarters. Given the improved performance in our mature store base during the quarter, we are -- we also believe that our traffic-driving merchandising and store operation initiatives are beginning to take hold. Highlights for the second quarter of 2017 include net sales increased 8.1% to $5.8 billion and same-store sales grew 2.6% as compared to the prior year second quarter. Same-store sales growth was positive for both consumables and combined non-consumable categories, with stronger growth in consumables. Net income was $295 million.  Diluted earnings per share of $1.08 included an approximate $0.02 per share charge associated with acquired stores primarily for lease termination costs. Year-to-date through the 2017 second quarter, we have returned over $306 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.3 million shares of common stock and the payment of quarterly dividends. During the quarter, we closed on the previously announced purchase from a small-box multi-price point retailer that resulted in approximately 285 net new sites located across 35 states.  Also, we have strengthened the management team with the addition of Jason Reiser as our EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer; and Carman Wenkoff as our EVP and Chief Information Officer. I believe both of these innovative and seasoned executives will help us execute our strategic vision and capture future growth opportunities.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter and our outlook. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results, starting with gross profit.  Gross profit for the 2017 quarter was $1.8 billion or 30.7% of sales, a decline of 47 basis points from last year's second quarter. As compared to the prior year second quarter, higher markdown primarily for promotional activities and a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories, and the sales mix within consumables, each reduced the gross profit rate. These factors were partially offset by higher initial markups on inventory purchases and an improvement in our inventory shrink rate.  SG&A expense increased by 51 basis points over the 2016 quarter to $1.3 billion or 22.3% of sales in the second quarter. This quarter's results reflected increased retail labor expenses primarily as a result of our investment in store manager compensation implemented earlier this year and occupancy costs, both of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. In addition, we incurred expenses related to our acquired store locations primarily for lease termination costs. Partially offsetting these items were lower waste management costs primarily resulting from our recycling efforts, reductions in advertising costs and a reduction in workers' compensation costs.  Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.2% as compared to 36.8% in the second quarter last year. The effective income tax rate was higher in the 2017 second quarter due primarily to the recognition of a tax benefit in the 2016 period associated with stock-based compensation that did not reoccur to the same extent in this quarter.  Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. Merchandise inventories at second quarter-end were $3.46 billion. For the quarter, total inventory increased 6% while declining 1% on a per store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with or below our sales growth.  Year-to-date through second quarter, we generated cash from operations of $786 million, a 1% decrease from the prior year, primarily due to increased income tax payments compared to the same period last year as a result of timing of income recognition for tax purposes due to changes in federal income tax regulations. We continue to have solid underlying performance in our cash from operations.  During the quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock for $75 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $71 million. Year-to-date through the end of the second quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $306 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividend. From December 2011 through the second quarter of 2017, we repurchased $4.7 billion or 76.7 million shares of our common stock. We have a remaining authorization of approximately $770 million under the repurchase program.  We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores where we continue to see great returns and the necessary infrastructure to support our store growth. Our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR.  Looking ahead, please keep a couple of points in mind. Comparisons to 2016 quarterly results are less challenging in the third quarter and more challenging in the fourth quarter. Recall, fiscal 2017 is a 52-week year versus the 2016 53-week year. We estimated that the 53rd week in 2016 contributed about $0.09 per share to earnings that will not occur this year. We are pleased with our performance at this point in the year. We now forecast GAAP diluted EPS to be $4.35 to $4.50 compared to our previous guidance range of $4.25 to $4.50. Our prior same-store sales growth guidance range of slightly positive to an increase of 2% is unchanged. We also continue to expect 2017 net sales to increase by approximately 5% to 7%. Given our performance in the first half and expectation for the back half of 2017, annual same-store sales is currently anticipated to be closer to the upper end of the range. 2017 capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $715 million to $765 million. Share repurchases for fiscal 2017 continue to be forecasted to be approximately $450 million.  Please keep in mind that our fiscal 2017 financial outlook does not reflect any potential impact from disaster-related expenses, including fixed asset and inventory impairment losses related to Hurricane Harvey, given the assessment of damage is still in process.  We remain committed to focusing on long-term profitable growth, reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings. We are investing in initiatives intended to drive same-store sales and build loyalty across our consumer base with prices that our customers need and trust from us. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thanks, John.  We are executing our plans, which, overall, are delivering our anticipated results. We are doing what we said we would do. We believe that, over time, our merchandising initiatives, coupled with our store manager pay and training investments, will continue to contribute to our same-store sales growth. Our real estate model remains healthy and our 2018 new store pipeline is strong and growing. For fiscal 2017, we plan to add about 1,285 new stores, including the net acquired sites.  Our model of value and convenience is relevant to a broad cross-section of shoppers. I believe the much reported demise of retail is an inaccurate narrative. Retail is just changing and we believe that we are very well-positioned. As I listen to the commentary about retail by others, I'm reminded of the many advantages we have at Dollar General and how uniquely positioned we are. I believe it is important for us to keep in mind how Dollar General is different. As we think about our many strengths, a common thread is the combination of value and convenience. I view this combination as a differentiator for us across retail shopping occasions and our customers' trip missions.  Our convenient small-box stores with strong economics allow us to serve an underserved customer. Our shopping occasions tend to be a convenient fill-in trip versus a stock-up trip. Our average basket contains about 5 items with an average ticket of about $12. Our stores and product mix are designed with convenience in mind, making it easy for our customers to get in, find what they need and be on their way.  We have a range of formats from 3,500 square feet to 16,000 square feet to capture growth opportunities in areas ranging from rural to metro locations. Our unique geographic footprint of 14,000 brick-and-mortar stores allow us to serve customers in areas where other retailers simply have not been as successful. Our customer is price-sensitive and we're committed to leveraging our buying power to deliver greater value and help her save money. We believe that we are able to serve our customers so well because we work hard to understand her needs. We continue to look for ways to improve our affordability and value for our customer, all while helping her save time. Our everyday low price positions us well across all classes of trade. We have the ability to capitalize on our track record of innovation in the channel. We recognize that retail is changing rapidly. At the same time, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to get ahead of these changes with our customers. As with other shopping patterns, behaviors and attitudes, our core customer are later adopters than other segments of the U.S. This holds true with their digital shopping experience in the categories that are relevant to Dollar General. With approximately 75% of the U.S. population within 5 miles of a Dollar General by the end of fiscal 2017, our opportunity is to help shape our customers' behavior and shopping habits on their digital shopping journey, all while capitalizing on our 14,000 brick-and-mortar stores and our geographic footprint to help them save time and money.  We are executing our comprehensive strategic plans, focusing on the actions that we believe have the greatest potential to drive shareholder value over the longer-term. We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail.  We remain committed to our long-term operating priorities. First, driving profitable sales growth. Second, capturing growth opportunities. Third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator. And fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.  Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. Our goal is to attract and grow new customers and trips and capture share with existing customers. This includes expanding the merchandising initiatives in our existing store base to drive traffic into those stores and improve same-store sales. Merchandising initiatives within all 4 product categories are being executed across a range of stores to provide customers with more of the products and brands they want and need to save time and money every day. The vast majority of these initiatives for fiscal 2017 have been implemented. While it's still early, overall, these initiatives are performing at or above our expectations.  One of the most exciting merchandising opportunities is across health and beauty where we have a significant opportunity to increase our share of wallet with our customers through trial and conversion. In beauty, we redesigned the cosmetic area in a large portion of our stores to highlight the breadth of on-trend products that we offer at compelling price points. Within the health departments, we increased our offering of value-added, differentiated products with a focus on health and wellness, nutrition and personal care. In the stores with these resets, we are seeing improvements in same-store sales.  We are also on track with remodeling about 300 traditional stores based on lessons learned from the conversion of larger square footage sites acquired last year. To-date, we have completed about 165 of these remodels, which include increasing the cooler set by about 160% on average from the existing cooler footprint for these locations. This allows for a greater perishable assortment that helps drive trips and basket size. Additionally, across about 1/3 of these locations, we are testing assortment of fresh produce. While it's still early, initial remodels are yielding strong same-store sales improvement. Over time, we believe that the lessons learned from these 300 or so remodels have the potential for broader application across significant portions of our store base as we refine our criteria to remodel with this new cooler expansion.  We are also strategically investing in the portion of our existing store base that has been opened for 5 years or more, what we often refer to as our mature store base. We are particularly focused on stores that have fewer than 10 cooler doors, which in relative terms are expected to drive the highest returns. By the end of 2017, we anticipate that across our store base we will have an average of 17 cooler doors, up from 10 in 2012. Year-to-date through the second quarter, approximately 16,000 cooler doors have been installed across the chain. For these locations, we are seeing an improvement in transactions.  On the customer side, we are seeing continued opportunity to improve engagement and build loyalty through the expansion of our digital footprint and the further integration of our traditional and digital media mix. Our plan is to reach our customers where, when and how they decide to engage with us.  We are also leveraging in-store operational initiatives such as improving our in-stock position through training and technology and our customer experience. The focus of our store operations is paying off as we have seen sequential improvements over the last 6 months in our customer satisfaction scores.  We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion through improvements in shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution transportation efficiencies and non-consumable sales.  As always, we will continue to work to ensure that our value proposition resonates with our customers. We are committed to providing them with everyday low prices that they know and trust. Our goal is to ensure we are highly relevant with our customers through our ongoing investments in everyday low prices and targeted promotional activity.  As we have consistently shared with you, one of the keys to our business is growing transactions in units. Our pricing surveys continue to indicate that Dollar General is very well-positioned from a price perspective against all classes of trade and across all geographic regions where we operate. We are committed to being priced right for our customers to drive traffic to our stores. Our focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities is our second priority. We have a proven high-return, low-risk model for our real estate growth. Our recently acquired sites are highly complementary to our long-term new store growth plans with about 85% located in metro areas. The majority of these sites are in strategic trade areas that we would have anticipated for new store site selection over time and allow us to reach certain of these areas faster and potentially more economically than with organic growth. As we look to build out these sites, the range of different DG store formats is a strength that we can leverage based on the marketplace along with the opportunity to test new ideas. Our plans for 2017 new store growth remain on track. I believe we continue to have first mover advantage to secure the best sites, while driving compelling new store average returns of approximately 20%.  We constantly monitor new store productivity and returns to ensure our new store growth is best use of our capital, focusing on the following 5 metrics : New store productivity as a percent of our comp store sales; actual sales performance compared to our pro forma model; returns of 18% to 20%; cannibalization of our new stores on our comp store base; and finally, a payback period of less than 2 years. Regardless of the metric, we have seen consistent performance over time from our new stores which are at or above our targets. I continue to be very pleased with our new store returns. We are committed to deploying our capital effectively to drive strong financial returns for the long-term and we continue to monitor these metrics very closely.  Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending. We are committed to simplifying operations in our stores by reducing inventory, operating complexity and product movement within the stores so that our store managers and their teams can reinvest time savings to provide better customer service and a clean in-stock shopping experience. At the store support center, work elimination and process improvement also are ongoing efforts to take costs out of the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always seek to be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe that they are a competitive advantage. As we enter 2017, we made significant investments in compensation and training for our store managers. Our data-driven approach to store manager compensation segments our stores based on labor market data and store-level complexity.  Overall, while it's still very early, the strategy for putting the investments to work in the marketplace is off to a good start. For existing store managers, we continue to experience a significant improvement in voluntary turnover since making the compensation investment. While internal promotions continue to be a great source of store managers who know our culture and processes, we have been able to attract experienced leaders from sectors of retail that assimilate well to our model and culture. The stores with these new external hires are seeing improved results in associate turnover and positive impacts to same-store sales. Our organization's core competencies of talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication will help us ensure that this investment pays off. The customer experience and the profitability of our stores should benefit over time from this investment given how important the leadership of the store manager is to these metrics. Our initial progress is encouraging.  This month, I had the opportunity to spend time with more than 1,500 leaders of our organization at our annual leadership meeting. I am always energized by their passion and commitment to serving others. This culture is critical part of our success.  Additionally, just 2 weeks ago, I had the pleasure to attend the opening of our 14,000th store in Dauphin, Pennsylvania and to engage with our local store teams and customers. With 14,000 stores and growing, I remain very excited about the opportunities we have as a company.  Although our strategic -- through our strategic plan, the team is continuing to focus on growth that creates value while laying the foundation for future initiatives. As for our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that, for our core customer, it is always challenging given the pressures on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they need and expect from Dollar General.  We are committed to our long-term growth and to the creation of shareholder value. Our business generates a significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program and anticipated dividends.  In closing, we are confident that our strategy positions us well for the future. I am very proud of the more than 127,000 employees at Dollar General across our 14,000 store locations, 15 distribution centers and here at the store support center. To each employee of Dollar General, thank you for your efforts to put our customers first.  With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So 2 questions, one tactical, one strategic. On the tactical side, the markdowns you had in the quarter related generally to what categories? And are we sort of through those as we head into the second half? Todd Vasos : Yes. The markdowns, John, they were a combination of a few things. Obviously, we had some markdowns as we continue to be very aggressive in our ability to deliver price to the consumer. And that was our biggest source of markdown, so both promotionally and everyday price-wise. As I said, we're committed to driving traffic in the store and delivering that everyday low price our consumers know and trust from us.  There was some other markdowns on some of the seasonal and non-consumable categories, but overall, they were much smaller in nature than the overall promotional activity to drive that top line. John Heinbockel : All right. Then, secondly, more bigger picture if you think about e-commerce. Is the nature of the dollar store customer and box, does it not lend itself operationally to things like BOPUS, home delivery, maybe using an instacard to ship from store? Is it just -- in the case you're trying to be simple and low-cost, does it just not work and does your customer not want it? Todd Vasos : Yes. We engage with our customers all the time, John, to understand where she's at in any given piece of her shopping business, including the digital side and where she's at. I can tell you today that while she is on a digital journey, she is definitely lagging somewhat behind where the total U.S. population is. I would never say never on any of those points that you bring up, but I can tell you that we're squarely focused on driving our customers into our 14,000 locations through any means that she wants to engage with us to include digital. We're up to nearly 10 million subscribers now on our digital coupon platform, which is growing each and every week, and that is a great source for her as she gets on our Dollar General app to understand what we offer her long-term.  Now stay tuned. As I mentioned on our last call, one of our strategic initiatives that we launched earlier this year is around digital and how digital will play with our Dollar General consumer as we go forward. So longer term, it is an initiative, but we'll have some milestones we'll be able to share with you as more comes available, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : Just on the gross profit margin that softened in the quarter, you called out several pluses and minuses, but curious how you're thinking about the back half of the year and the complexion on the gross margin line. John Garratt : Yes. So as we've said, we're very focused on driving traffic and pleased with the results that we got there. As we look long-term, we continue to see opportunities to increase margins or strategically invest back as needed to drive traffic and grow sales. We're not commenting specifically on the mix between gross margin and SG&A, but rest assured we're going to be focused on all the levers within both to deliver that. We continue to see opportunity to improve shrink, pleased with 3 straight quarters of improvement there. The team continues to do a very good job of category management while making sure we have what the customer wants. We continue to see opportunity over time to increase sales of private label, direct foreign sourcing and continue to drive efficiencies on supply chain. So we see an opportunity to enhance gross margin over time, but we're going to do what's right for the business for the long term and making sure we drive that traffic. Charles Grom : Okay. That's helpful. And then, the second question would be you called out traffic as positive in the second quarter. Could you shed some light on the improvement? And also how the quarter trended month-by-month and any perspective on the quarter-to-date trends? And then, just geographically, any major differences more recently, particularly down in Texas? Todd Vasos : Chuck, first of all, when you take a look, we are very pleased with those traffic numbers turning positive and actually gaining strength as we move through the quarter. The great thing that we've seen is that, in the quarter, all of our periods were positive and it shaped up very nicely as we expected it would.  And as we look geographically, I tell you, it was very, very balanced throughout the country. And obviously we're experiencing a little bit of turmoil right now. My heart goes out to those folks down in the Gulf Coast region because they're suffering through a real tough time. The great thing is that we've got some fabulous people down in that area that are really taking care of our customers. We've had upwards of 300 stores closed at any given time. We have -- we're down to probably 100 or less at this point. And I could tell you our teams are working diligently to be able to service that customer down there. But more to come. Things are pretty fluid still down there so we're not able yet to get to a few of our stores just because of the floodwaters and the blockage down there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : I was hoping you could remind us or give us some color on the Dollar Express impact on your results. It looked like because of the timing of the closing, it makes the sort of simple calculation in new store productivity look a little light for the second quarter. But could you sort of let me know if that's true and how the core new store productivity looked in the second quarter? And then, is there anything that we should anticipate for the back half as those Dollar Express stores come in? Maybe remind us, are they a starting with much lower gross margins than chain average? Is there a further expense pressure we should think about? John Garratt : So a couple of pieces there. In terms of the impact of Dollar Express on Q2, as we hadn't opened these stores yet during that period, we had no revenue, but did have costs associated with that. We had called that out as $0.02 in total. And if you look at the SG&A line, if not for -- the reason we deleveraged on SG&A was really a function of that coupled with the investment we've made earlier this year in store manager pay. Now we're opening these stores. As we get into the back half of the year, we'll have revenue associated with that. We're very excited about these units. They're highly complementary. They're in places that we wanted to go. We feel very confident in our ability to open these and deliver great results with these. And as we've said before, it would be modestly accretive to the year just given the back-loaded nature of getting these stores opened and the front-end costs associated with that. Robert Ohmes : Got it. That's helpful. And just a separate question. Any update on the DGX format and how that did in the second quarter? Todd Vasos : As you know, we only have -- we actually have 3 open now. We opened our third one just recently in Philadelphia. And we're happy with the progress that we've seen there. So obviously, with only 3 stores, it really doesn't have a material impact on the total with 14,000, but the great thing about that format is it allows us to get into highly dense areas, vertical living type areas where, in the past, we have not been able to go into. And many of those areas, as you know, houses a lot of that millennial customer that will continue to be a great source of revenue for us and others as they continue to mature in their age curve. So we're pretty happy so far, but again, with only 3, we're just cautiously optimistic about what that could do, but we're also learning at the same time. And I'm sure what the box looks like today will change over time as we learn more and more what the customer wants out of that format. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Fletcher with Bernstein. Brandon Fletcher : My follow-up is actually -- and I appreciate the strategic outlay. Just a third point. I spent most of my career harvesting expenses and then was amazed at how many more hands were out to invest that money than were out to find similar savings. And what I worry about is the discipline you have on real estate is truly fantastic. Do you feel confident that the same discipline is being applied in other investments? So when you find an efficiency in freight, when would you find something else, do you feel confident that if you don't hand that money back to shareholders, you really are using the same investment rigor to make sure that you're getting a meaningful return in that and it's not people just kind of going, well, if we didn't do this, sales would be lower, so you have to let me raise the marketing spend or whatever it is? Just love some approach that you guys have on that topic. John Garratt : Yes. So I would say, as with real estate, we're disciplined in all capital and we look at everything through the lens of does it touch the customer, does it align with our strategic priorities, does it put the business at risk? And if it doesn't, we don't spend that money. We have teams dedicated at both the expense and capital side, removing all those costs to make sure that we're tight on that. And the way we look at it, everything has to have a return here.  And referring back to the new stores, I should have mentioned earlier, we're continuing to see productivity in that 80% to 85% range. So we're seeing great returns. It's still north of 20%. And we target 18%, 20%, still at that 20% range. So we're getting great returns there and feel very good about the targeted investments.  I think the other thing I'd stress is the investments we've made have been very targeted. And we're pleased with the results we're seeing there, whether it be the store manager compensation where we see a return there and are pleased with what we're seeing there, whether it be what we've done to drive traffic and pleased with the results we've seen in traffic, whether it be the investment in new stores or acquired stores where we see the same compelling returns and great unit level economics. Brandon Fletcher : Okay. Great. And then, just the direction, just as a follow-up, that could mean that as you go through this process, you could find that all of the rational investments have been made, some other efficiency comes out and it's still possible for margin to go up. In a particular scenario -- I'm not saying you're committing to that obviously, but it's still possible. You would still consider that your profit margin might go up if you found all this extra money. John Garratt : Yes. We still see opportunity managing all the levers within gross margin and SG&A to enhance our operating margins over time. At times like this year, we will make investments, but we see opportunity to enhance that over time given all the levers we have and the team's track record of working these levers very effectively. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : I wanted to just kind of get your view of the low end consumer. I know you said kind of continue to see constrained consumer and what not. But obviously during the second quarter, it was encouraging to see the positive ticket as well as traffic. How would you kind of parse that out? You were going up against some of the onset of the heavier promos last year, the SNAP reductions, but knowing that you're expecting to be toward the upper end of the range for the full year. So kind of what are you seeing out of that consumer? What's in the basket? And maybe any commentary on kind of more discretionary categories as well as we get into the second half year? Todd Vasos : Vinnie, when we take a look at the quarter, the consumer, it was behaving about where we thought that she was at in her economic cycle, and that is she is feeling a little bit better. But always keep in mind, this consumer is always stretched because of her economic condition as well as the expenses that she has in front of her.  In saying that, I think the company did a great job, our merchants, our operators, in delivering a real good product to that consumer. Our consumable business definitely outpaced our non-consumable business, but it was very good to see both were positive, albeit consumables being a little bit more positive. So as you look at that basket, there was more consumables in that basket than non.  The great thing I believe that we have to look forward to as I look to the back half of the year and I look at what we have for fourth quarter and Christmas holiday selling season, we have a great lineup ahead of us. And we're fairly bullish on what that should return as far as what the consumer will gravitate to. The product looks great. It's great value. And with our 14,000 store convenient locations, I believe that we're set up pretty well for the back half of the year. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. That's helpful. And just for the follow-up, if I could go back to store growth for a second. So we know obviously that DGX, only 3 at the moment. Also, the smaller kind of 6,000-foot stores. Are you guys seeing pretty consistent performance within those specific smaller formats? And as you're looking at some of your real estate possible sites going forward within kind of that normalized 6% to 8% annual growth, do you think -- is it safe to say that the smaller formats as a class will become more a part of that going forward? Todd Vasos : Sure, Vinnie. I would tell you that we're very happy with all the different formats and we are seeing a very consistent return based on each and every format that we have. In saying that, the small format continues to do very well to your point. It's a great format to have in the arsenal, both for very rural crossroad-type areas in rural locations and then in more of our metro and satellite city areas. It gives us the flexibility and opportunity to get into some of those. I still have to say though that our workhorse, our 7,200 to 7,400 square foot sales floor box is definitely the most productive. And you'll see the majority of our stores in the near future still built under that format, but we'll be opportunistic in using the other formats where that 7,200 or the 7,400 square foot store may just -- may not fit just right in there. We just won't turn down a site that we believe is very good over the long-term just because it doesn't fit into one prototype or the other. We'll make sure that we're able to get into those with our great array of formats that we have available today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : I would agree with you that the demise of retail is inaccurate, but not everyone believes that. But, I guess, the question I would have is that it does seem from your results the concern would be that to generate a comp, it's going to take a lot more investing, I guess, whether it be margin or labor or whatever, I mean, both in this case in this quarter. So, I guess, the question I have is maybe can you give a little color on that? Do you think that first half is just maybe a trough or, I guess, the peak in terms of the investments and then it tends to abate in the back half? And then, I guess, the second question I would just have is looking at your guide -- implied guidance for the second half, obviously, consensus is at the high end of your range for the second half. And maybe a little color on where you think people are off, whether third quarter versus fourth quarter, in terms of being too high? Or is it pretty evenly distributed? John Garratt : Sure. So starting with in terms of the investments, what I would say is that the investments we made this year, we don't see anything on the horizon this time of that magnitude. We felt these were the right investments for the long term of the business. As we look out, we don't see any of that magnitude.  In terms of the store openings, we continue to see great results there. As I mentioned, we continue to see the stores performing right around that 100% comparison pro forma within the 80% to 85% productivity, returns of 20%, a short payback and haven't seen -- cannibalization continues to be consistent with what -- where we've been and what we expect. We're seeing great results there. Yes, we made these investments with the long term in mind and are seeing great results from that and are pleased with results. But we feel very confident in the long-term growth of the business and the strength of the business unit, the business fundamentals and what we're seeing and the cash we're generating, too, from these stores. So feel very good about that. If you look at the guidance, yes, we thought, as we look halfway through the year and the back half expectations, that it was appropriate to point toward the high end, the upper end of the comp range and appropriate to narrow the range of EPS. In terms of the cadence, I think the thing we try to stress here is that, yes, the -- from a performance standpoint, the lap is more challenging in Q4 than Q3. And in Q4, you have that 53rd week. So as we look at the cadence between the 2, we'd look for a much stronger Q3 compared to Q4. I think that's something to consider as you model out the back half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So I just want to poke you a little bit again on the margins, particularly on the gross margin side of things. I know you guys said that you had some higher markups in the consumable area. Just trying to understand, as we look out at the competitive landscape over the next 12 to 18 months, how we -- how that won't be an ongoing theme? That's my first question. Todd Vasos : Yes, sure. As I'd consistently talked about, and not just I, but many years in the past, it is our intent here at the Dollar General to drive units through this -- our boxes here at Dollar General and delivering that value to the consumer. And we did exactly what we said we were going to do and we did that and invested in some price to do that through promotional price as well as some of the everyday low prices. I can tell you though that most of it is done through everyday low price. And as you look at our pricing position today, we are as good, if not better, than any point in time in the 9 years that I've been here across all geographic regions which we do business in as well as against any class of trade. So I think we're in a great, great position as we go forward to be able to attract the consumer into a -- in a Dollar General. And if you take a look at our share as well overall, our share is as strong as it's been in many years and growing and gaining traction as we move through the quarter. So our prices and where we are today is definitely resonating with our consumer. And we feel that, right now, we're in a real great position to offer her that convenience and that value as we move through the back half. Scott Mushkin : As far as expecting gross margin investment on kind of a go-forward basis as you look at the competitive environment, is that something we should expect? I mean, we obviously have a lot going on particularly in some of your core markets. Todd Vasos : Again, we're very competitively priced today. I would tell you, as we look out, that we're well-priced today and I don't see us having to do anything that's very dramatic. But the great thing that I believe that we have here is the ability to continue to get our margins in other areas such as global sourcing, such as our private brands, such as our areas of transportation and distribution. We've got some real opportunities in that. And as I mentioned earlier, we're very bullish on what we see coming in the fourth quarter with our non-consumable sales and our business there with the lineup that we have coming into the fourth quarter. So we see opportunities to grow margin over time and we don't believe that we're in any long-term strong investment periods. We just don't see that as we go forward right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : So you said you feel good about where your prices are and they haven't been this good in 9 years. So does that mean that you're just not seeing others invest in price? Or you're matching the price investments that others are making and you're able to navigate it through only modest decreases in your gross margin? Todd Vasos : As we look out, we obviously monitor price across all geographic regions that we do business in. And again, I would say that we are as good a price, if not better, than we've been in many years, including the 9 years that I've been here. And as we look at that, we did not have to take any large price decreases to get there. So they were very modest in nature. I think they were very well-balanced, but they were definitely targeted in areas of our consumable businesses to drive traffic and to give the consumer that value that she knows and trusts from Dollar General. I think that's the way to look at it and it's probably the way to look at it as we go through the back half of this year. Michael Lasser : And given some of the commentary you've made, did you pull forward some markdowns that you were going to otherwise make in the back half of the year into the second quarter such that the gross margin pressure will get less bad moving forward? Todd Vasos : We really didn't pull any markdowns forward. But in saying that, I would tell you that we have gross margin opportunities ahead of us that we'll hopefully start to see some moderation of the year-over-year declines as we move through the back half of the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Alvin Concepcion : I just want to dive into the store resets a little bit. It sounds like some of the things you're doing are driving a comp lift even with produce. I'm just curious what kind of uplift you're seeing? I think remodels, you've mentioned in the past, were a 4% to 5% uplift, but it sounds like some of these things might be driving a growth higher than that. So I'm wondering if you could shed some color on that. Todd Vasos : Yes. We are very happy with our new stores as well as our remodel and relocation program. As it relates to the remodels, we are right on track to where we thought we would be on the remodels, both the number of remodels as well as the returns that we expected to see.  The great thing about the 300 that we called out, which we've done just over 185 or so of them to-date with about 1/3 of them with the produce, they are producing 3 to 4x what a normal remodel produces. So we're very excited about that. And we believe that it has broader application across many of our areas where we'll need to remodel stores over the next few years.  So we believe that, overall, this could be a real win for Dollar General and for our consumers because what it does is it offers our consumers items such as produce, expanded fresh, frozen and dairy type products as well as expanded areas of dry grocery as well as some of our non-consumable areas. So when you look at the complete package of these remodels, we feel very comfortable and confident that we have a blueprint to go forward with into next year. Alvin Concepcion : Great. If I could squeeze one in. I'm just curious if you have any updated thoughts on what comp level you can leverage SG&A at. I'm wondering if there's opportunities to bring that lower since it sounds like you have a lot of tools under your belt and levers to pull. John Garratt : Yes. So I think if you just look at this quarter, as I've mentioned, the reason we didn't lever was because of those 2 items, those 2 investments. So if you think of it that way, you're coming in at 2.6% comp. We've set our goal with 2.5% to 3%, and you're right there. So I think that's the way to look at it.  Last year, we were able to leverage at a lower point. The team really was able to flex down a difficult environment. But we want to have that right balance when needed pulling back, but making investments as needed for the long-term as well. So I still think that 2.5% to 3% over time is the right way to look at it. And again, if not for those 2 items, we would have been there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Most of my questions have been asked. So just one more quick clarification and follow-up. One, the gross margins. You did make a comment a little while ago about expectations or opportunities for the moderation of the year-over-year declines we've seen in the first half. I just wanted to maybe go into just a little bit more detail on the puts and takes there because obviously -- specifically, you did face a number of headwinds beginning in the third quarter of last year where you had markdowns and promotions and inventory clearance in 3Q last year. And so I just want to ensure that it is fair for us to assume that, on that easy compare, we will see nice sequential improvement on gross margins as we think about the third quarter. John Garratt : I think that's a fair statement. As you look to the third quarter, it's a fair statement to expect an improvement there and that's what we're expecting. And you're right. I think with the investments we made last year, we're in a good spot and will meet year-over-year at that level. So we should see an improvement. Paul Trussell : Okay. Fair enough. And then, as we think about the 2.6% comp obviously driven by strong traffic, your guidance obviously for the balance of the year kind of implies comps on average probably something a little bit lighter than that. Just help us kind of with the thought process of how you're thinking about DG's ability to consistently put up this level of comp performance. And again, just kind of the puts and takes on your ability to sustain the current level of comps that you just reported. Todd Vasos : Paul, I think the thing to point to here is we feel very good about our initiative both on the short-term and long-term initiatives that we have moving through. And our short-term ones are really starting to just take hold now and are really starting to benefit the comp. So whether it's the health and beauty initiative, whether it's the cooler expansion initiative and we have a plethora of other ones through due course of business, I would tell you that we feel good about where we're headed on the comp side. But keep in mind, there's still half a year to go still. And being the fourth quarter our largest sales quarter, we thought it prudent to sit back and at least let everyone know we anticipate being at the top end of the guidance range for sales. And I think that's a good place to pinpoint right now. If that changes as we move out of the third quarter, we'll definitely make sure everyone understands where we are coming out of Q3 and into Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal : All right. So at the risk of beating a dead horse. My first question is sort of still on the margins here. And I got the gross down, I think, but if we think about SG&A for a moment, I guess, the acquisition-related costs is, I guess, about 15 basis points. I think salary hikes are said to be worth about 30. So those 2 pieces get me to 45 if I think about what's sort of nonrecurring, which still leaves us about 6 bps of deleverage. And I know I'm not getting the Georgia DC in that number. So I'm wondering if you can kind of quantify that investment. And if that's in excess of 6, like, you probably would have levered on this comp, yes? John Garratt : Yes. So I would say your numbers are a little low. And for that reason, if you add up those 2 numbers, that would have gotten us to a point where we didn't delever. So you are in the ballpark, but a little low there. And again, these are onetime items that we wouldn't see as we go forward next year. Stephen Tanal : Got it. Okay. And so the idea is you probably would have levered in a more normal environment on the 2.6%, yes? John Garratt : That's correct. Stephen Tanal : Okay. And then, I guess, just a lot has been discussed already, but as you kind of think about the improvement in consumables despite what, I guess, many of us are thinking about is a pretty intense competitive environment, what worked better here? Or did the backdrop get a little bit little less tough? How would you sort of talk through that? Todd Vasos : I think the way to look at it is 2 different ways. One, the lap did get a little easier because some of the transitory issues that we brought out last year in unit price deflation as well as the SNAP benefit reductions that took place started to moderate in Q2 and will continue to moderate as we move through the back half of the year.  The other piece though, I think, to really think about is our initiatives and how well they're performing and taking hold. That was a big piece of our comp driver in the quarter and a lot of those initiatives were centered around our consumable areas. Remember, health and beauty, for us, falls in our consumable numbers and are reported through that as well as our cooler expansions are in there. So we've got a lot of initiatives centered around consumables, not only just the food side, but health and beauty and other areas. So I believe that's the way to look at it and also the way to look at it as we move through the back half of the year. Mary Winn Pilkington : Hope, I've let the call a runover a little bit. And so I think we've taken our last question. So everyone that we've left in the queue, I apologize. I'm available for any questions. And as always, we appreciate your interest in Dollar General. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Todd Vasos : Thank you, Mary Winn, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I'm pleased with our third quarter performance, as the Dollar General team delivered strong same-store sales growth, driven by an increase in average transaction amount and positive traffic, all while expanding gross profit margin and exhibiting good underlying expense control. We are excited about our plans for the fourth quarter and into the new year.  Our third quarter results were achieved even in the midst of the hurricanes that impacted our business during the quarter. We estimate that the net negative impact of these storms in the quarter, including loss of inventory and incremental repairs for damages and other expenses, offset by increased sales, was approximately $0.05 per diluted share. I'd like to thank and also recognize all of the Dollar General teams that worked extensively to be there in advance of the storms and afterwards to support our communities during the recovery process. When our employees, customers and communities needed us, team members from across the organization were there providing support for our impacted stores and co-workers. To all the teams that worked so hard to ensure our co-workers' safety, to secure and staff our stores and to meet the needs of our customers, thank you. This dedication to our mission of serving others is what makes us and our company so special.  Turning now to the highlights of the third quarter of 2017. Net sales increased 11% to $5.9 billion, and same-store sales grew 4.3% as compared to the prior year third quarter. Same-store sales for the quarter benefited by an estimated 30 to 35 basis points from incremental sales due to the hurricanes. Same-store sales growth was positive for both consumables and combined non-consumable categories, with stronger growth in consumables. Our highly consumable market share trends in syndicated data continue to exhibit strength with high single-digit share growth in both units and dollars over the 12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending November 4.  Our mature store base, which are stores that are over 5 years old and have not been remodeled or relocated, continues to deliver the best same-store sales growth that we've seen in 4 years. In addition, the contribution of same-store sales growth from our real estate maturation curve, including new stores, relocations and remodels, was at the high end of our expectations. We executed 634 real estate projects in the quarter, including 470 new store openings.  Net income was $253 million and diluted earnings per share grew 11% to $0.93, which includes $0.05 per share for the estimated net negative impact associated with the hurricanes. Year-to-date through the 2017 third quarter, we have returned $512 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 4 million shares of common stock and the payment of quarterly dividends. Given our year-to-date performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our reported EPS guidance for the full year. John will provide more details on our outlook.  The fundamentals of our business remain strong. Our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver strong top line growth as we delivered the best same-store sales growth in 11 quarters.  Now I'll turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter and our outlook, then I'll share some highlights of our initiatives for fiscal 2018. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our third quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results, starting with gross profit.  Gross profit for the 2017 quarter was $1.8 billion or 29.9% of sales, an improvement of 8 basis points from last year's third quarter. As compared to the prior year third quarter, the gross profit rate increase was primarily attributable to higher initial inventory markup and lower inventory shrink. Partially offsetting these items were a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories; sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumable sales; and increased transportation costs.  SG&A expense increased by 40 basis points over the 2016 quarter to $1.3 billion or 22.9% of sales in the third quarter. This quarter's SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor expenses given our previously planned investment in store manager compensation and increased incentive compensation and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. The increased occupancy costs were primarily attributable to a record number of 470 new store openings in the quarter, over half of which were related to acquired stores and which represents an 82% increase in openings over the prior year third quarter. We also recorded $24.8 million of incremental expenses related to the impact of the hurricanes, which occurred during the quarter, as Todd discussed earlier. Partially offsetting these increased expenses were lower utilities costs and a reduction in advertising costs. Please keep in mind, in the 2016 third quarter, we incurred charges of $13 million associated with store sites acquired from a large box retailer and the related closure of existing stores, plus an estimated $7.7 million of incremental disaster-related expenses. In our press release issued this morning, we have provided a table detailing the estimated impact of the 2017 hurricanes on our third quarter results.  Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.8% as compared to 36.2% in the third quarter last year. The effective income tax rate was lower in the 2017 third quarter due primarily to the recognition of greater federal Work Opportunity Tax Credits this quarter as compared to the prior year quarter.  Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. Merchandise inventories at third quarter end were $3.6 billion. For the quarter, total inventory increased 3.1% while declining 4.9% on a per-store basis. This marks our second consecutive quarter of inventory decline on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape and are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with or below our sales growth. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $1.14 billion, an $18 million increase compared to the same period last year. This year's increase was primarily due to an improvement in our same-store inventory level, partially offset by increased income tax payments as a result of timing of income recognition for tax purposes. It is also important to note that we are lapping significant working capital improvements from 2016. We continue to be pleased with our solid cash flow generation.  During the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock for $135 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $71 million. Year to date through the end of the third quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $512 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividends. From December 2011 through the third quarter of 2017, we repurchased $4.9 billion or 78.4 million shares of our common stock. We have a remaining authorization of approximately $635 million under the repurchase program.  We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores, where we continue to see great returns, and the necessary infrastructure to support our store growth. Our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases.  Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Looking ahead, please keep a couple of points in mind. Recall, fiscal 2017 is a 52-week year versus the 2016 53-week year. We estimated that the 53rd week in 2016 contributed about $0.09 per share to earnings that will not recur this year. As Todd mentioned, we are pleased with our performance at this point in the year. We are narrowing our forecast for GAAP diluted EPS to a range of $4.37 to $4.47 compared to our previous guidance range of $4.35 to $4.50. Given that our guidance is on a reported GAAP basis, we are absorbing the $0.05 per diluted share for the net negative impact associated with the hurricanes. However, we are only reducing the high end of our guidance range by $0.03. For the fiscal year, this guidance includes the debt extinguishment charge of $0.01 per share recorded in the first quarter and absorbs 2 items that were not contemplated when either we provided our initial fiscal 2017 EPS guidance or our most recent update : number one, the $0.02 per share charge recorded in the second quarter primarily for lease termination costs; and number two, the estimated $0.05 per share net negative impact of the hurricanes during the quarter. Our guidance does not contemplate any potential impact from U.S. corporate tax legislation reform.  We are raising our 2017 same-store sales growth forecast to approximately 2.5% and updating our 2017 net sales growth forecast to approximately 7%, which is at the high end of our prior outlook of 5% to 7% growth. We are also updating our 2017 capital expenditures forecast to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million as compared to our previous guidance of $715 million to $765 million.  Share repurchases for the fiscal 2017 continue to be forecasted at approximately $450 million. We have been very disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal to deliver consistent, strong financial performance while positioning our business for long-term growth, and we plan to continue with this strategy into the future. We're investing in initiatives intended to drive same-store sales and build loyalty across our consumer base with the value and convenience that our customers need and trust from us.  With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thanks, John. As we have shared with you over the course of the last several quarters, our expectations were that over time, the transitory headwinds we were facing would moderate and our merchandising initiatives, coupled with our store manager pay and training investments, will continue to contribute to our same-store sales growth. I believe we saw this continue to play out in our results for the third quarter and that we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from our model of value and convenience that is relevant to a broad cross-section of shoppers.  Dollar General is differentiated by many strengths, all of which are focused on the combination of value and convenience for our customers. We are executing our comprehensive strategic plans focusing on the actions that we believe have the greatest potential to drive shareholder value over the longer term. We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. Our unique strengths include more than 14,000 convenient, small-box stores with strong economics that allow us to serve an underserved customer who shops our stores differently than other sectors of retail. With an average basket of about 5 items and an average ticket of approximately $12, our stores and product mix are streamlined to help make the shopping trip convenient for our customers. They can easily shop our stores, find what they need and be on their way.  With our strong stores growth, we anticipate that 75% of the U.S. population will be within 5 miles of a Dollar General by the end of fiscal 2017. Our range of formats, from 3,500 square feet to 16,000 square feet, allows Dollar General to capture growth opportunities in areas ranging from rural to metro locations. Once we find an attractive site, we can be flexible to optimize the store square footage that can best fit the opportunity.  We are strategically investing in our business to help our customers utilize digital tools and resources for a personalized shopping experience at Dollar General. We have the unique opportunity to help shape our customers' behavior and habit as their digital shopping journey, all while leveraging our more than 14,000 brick-and-mortar stores and our geographic footprint to help them save time and money.  We remain committed to our long-term operating priorities : first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth, with a focus on driving both the top line and bottom line. Our goal is to both attract and grow new customers and trips and to capture share with existing customers. This includes expanding the merchandising initiatives in our existing store base to drive traffic into those stores and improve same-store sales. For 2018, our merchandising initiatives are designed to provide our customers with trusted, simple solutions to help them manage their household budgets and provide them with even more value. We know that our customer looks to us to fill an immediate need while also providing the opportunity to make purchasing decisions in the aisle that fit within her budget. Our research indicates that our customers not only like but also have a need to make purchasing decisions they can see and touch while making in-aisle trade-offs between shopping considerations such as opening price points, affordability compared to value and/or pack size, to name just a few examples. Based on our customer insights, we know that among the most important drivers of our customers' trip to Dollar General is the ease of shopping our stores with the value and quality they expect from us in an enjoyable shopping experience. Our 2018 merchandising initiatives are designed to provide easy, identifiable, everyday low prices with a focus on opening price points, including the $1 price point, contemplated with -- complemented, excuse me, with compelling promotions. Our goals are for our assortment to be differentiated and on trend and to continue to elevate the in-store experience through our store layout and in-stock reliability, in an easy and fun shopping environment.  In-store for 2018, we plan to redesign our snack and beverage aisle to create a best-in-retail shopping experience. This change should enhance customer awareness and further position us as a destination retailer for the immediate consumption shop through assortment and everyday low prices. Across a select group of stores, we also will be introducing an expanded assortment of better-for-you products with a focus on higher protein, lower salt and healthier food choices at price points that will be attractive to our customers.  The Dollar General customer looks to us to be part of her solutions for her day-to-day shopping needs. Over the last several years, our expansion of coolers has helped drive trips and basket size. The affinity between perishables and other categories is evident in our customers' shopping habits. We continue to believe we have an opportunity to selectively expand cooler doors to allow for a great assortment of perishable foods, ice cream, single-serve drinks and cold beer. By the end of 2017, we anticipate that across our store base, we will have an average of 18 cooler doors, up from 10 in 2012. Year-to-date through the third quarter, approximately 18,000 cooler doors have been installed across our existing stores. For the locations receiving incremental coolers, we continue to see an improvement in transactions. Our initiatives for 2018 will continue to build on our multi-year track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales.  Given our success this year expanding health and beauty aid products, we will be launching Phase 2 of this initiative. The great news is that we have a substantial opportunity to capture share in health and beauty. Importantly, while we are making progress in our syndicated share trends this year, our health and beauty aid share is still below our customers' and household needs categories. Our 2018 plans are targeted to invest in driving overall category awareness with our customers through improved and impactful displays, consistent messaging in stores and across print and digital media, enhanced quality perception and superior shopability. We see significant runway for this category, given our price advantage relative to some other channels.  The expansion of private brand offerings, with a focus on quality and appealing packaging, will play a role in our category management process while helping our customers stretch their budgets. For instance, in just 7 years, we have built the proprietary brand of Rexall to nearly $200 million in sales through our commitment to quality, price and assortment. We know that private brands resonate with our customer when we deliver the right combination of price and quality. Given the significant price gap as compared to national brands and to other channels such as drugstores, private brands play a significant role in helping our customers manage their budgets.  Across the non-consumable categories, our 2018 merchandising initiatives will continue to be relevant to our customers while positioning Dollar General as a fun place to shop. We plan to introduce new and expanded categories with improved value across non-consumables. Our customer loves the in-store treasure hunt at Dollar General for unique items to delight her family. We believe our product offering will be at price points that she is comfortable with, as the vast majority of our product offering will continue to be priced below $10.  Moving now to our marketing initiatives. We see a continued opportunity to improve engagement and build loyalty through expansion of our digital footprint and further integration of our traditional and digital media mix. Our plan is to reach our customers where, when and how they decide to engage with us. We intend to continue to innovate in the channel in this area. To assist with these efforts, we have hired our first Chief Digital and Customer Engagement Officer, a newly created position that will help lead the strategy for customer engagement, including digital experience and tools. This position should help accelerate our digital strategy as we continue to develop resources to personalize offerings for our customers to save time and money. With more than 10 million subscribers to the DG Digital Coupon program, we have a great foundation to build on for the future.  We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion that include improvements in shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution and transportation efficiencies and non-consumable sales. Inventory shrink reduction continues to be a large opportunity in gross margin. In 2018, we plan to expand electronic article surveillance to an incremental 5,000 stores, bringing the total stores with EAS to about 10,000 locations. This is a proven high-return project for us to help further reduce shrink and drive sales to improve product availability.  While we have seen carrier rates and fuel costs on the rise, we are working to mitigate these costs through stem mile reductions and optimization of loads. Our Jackson, Georgia distribution facility began shipping in October of this year. Given our experience in opening 6 distribution centers since 2012, the team is getting better and more efficient with each opening. The Jackson, Georgia location has come out of the gate strong as well. Additionally, across our distribution centers, we have implemented pay-for-performance, which is a win-win for our employees and for our company.  As always, we continue to work to ensure that our value proposition resonates with our customers. We are committed to providing them with everyday low prices that they know and trust. Our goal is to ensure we are highly relevant with our customers through our ongoing investments in everyday low prices and targeted promotional activity. We have consistently shared with you one of the keys to our business is growing transaction and item units. Our pricing surveys continue to indicate that Dollar General is well-positioned from a price perspective against all classes of trade and across all geographic regions where we operate. We are committed to being priced right for our customers to drive traffic to our stores.  Our focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities is our second priority. We have a proven high-return, low-risk model for our real estate growth. We constantly monitor new store productivity and returns to ensure our stores' growth is the best use of our capital, focusing on the following 5 metrics : first, new store productivity as a percent of our comp store sales; actual sales performance compared with our pro forma model; average returns of 18% to 20%; cannibalization of our new stores on our comp store base; and finally, a payback period of less than 2 years.  Our 2017 new store growth is right on track, with strong sales and returns. The nearly 300 store sites we acquired earlier in 2017 continue to be an exciting opportunity for us as we gain more exposure in metro locations. We are seeing that our brand is resonating in geographic areas that are new to us, as some of our highest sales performance is coming from areas where we historically have not had a presence. Overall, the performance of this group of stores continues to gain traction as we build our brand in these locations.  For 2018, we expect to open 900 new stores, remodel 1,000 of our mature store locations and relocate about 100 stores. That's about 2,000 projects in total. With solid new store productivity, we have the opportunity to significantly increase our mature store remodel program with the goal to touch each location approximately every 7 to 10 years. Our experience gives us confidence in the incremental sales lift and returns from our remodel program as we look to enhance and consistently deliver on our brand promise to help our customers save time and money every day. Of the 1,000 planned store remodels for 2018, we currently expect approximately 400 locations to be in the Dollar General traditional Plus format, with 34 cooler doors for increased perishable selection. Our cooler door expansion has proven to drive baskets and trips with our customer base while also attracting new customers with the expanded offering.  Our strong real estate model allows us the ability to invest in new store growth, enter new markets, deliver new formats and reinvest in our mature store base.  Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending. At the store level, we are always focused on our process to drive productivity inside the 4 walls of our stores. For 2018, our store operation initiatives are centered on space optimization and ongoing efforts to simplify operations in our stores by reducing inventory, operating complexity and product movement within the stores. These actions are designed to allow our store managers and their teams to reinvest time savings to provide better customer service and a clean in-stock shopping experience.  Additionally, we have a focus on improving the speed of checkout. We look for opportunities to capture the benefits of reducing transaction time at checkout. For example, consider the significant opportunity we have to drive costs out of the system by reducing as little as 3 seconds in each of our approximately 2 billion customer transactions. These time savings can be reinvested by the store teams to deliver a higher level of customer service, which ultimately helps improve sales. Our ability to drive execution across our large and growing store base is a key strength to Dollar General.  Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, control expenses and always seek to be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people, as we believe they are a competitive advantage. The significant investment in store manager compensation and training we made this year is paying off, as our store manager turnover for 2017 is on track to be at the lowest level in the recorded history of the company. For the seventh consecutive year, Dollar General was named to Training magazine's top 125 training list, moving up every year in the rankings of companies that are recognized for excellence in employee training and development. For 2018 list, to be released in February, we rank now in the top 5. Collectively, the team and I are very proud of these results. The leadership of our store manager is key to helping improve the customer experience and profitability of our stores. Our investment in store manager compensation is anticipated to continue to positively impact our results next year. We are excited about how engaged our workforce is across our business. I believe that this has helped to contribute to our improvement in our overall customer satisfaction scores, which are currently at the highest level of the year.  Turning now to our customer. We operate with the assumption that in challenging times, she needs us more than ever, and in good times, she has a little bit more money to spend with us. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, our goal is to do everything we can to provide them with a great shopping experience, to deliver value and convenience they need and expect from Dollar General.  We are committed to our long-term growth and to the creation of shareholder value. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program and anticipated dividends.  We are excited about our plans for the future. The team is making thoughtful investments that ensure our strategy resonates with our customers and positions us for the long term. I look forward to sharing more details with you in the future.  As we are in the busiest time at retail, I want to thank each of our approximately 130,000 employees across the company for their tremendous efforts to help our customers save time and money every day. The team did an amazing job during the third quarter of 2017, executing a record 634 real estate projects in just a single quarter. I appreciate all the hard work of our employees across the store operations, distribution centers and at the store support center, to support the approximately 2 billion customer transactions we execute annually.  Before we open the lines for questions, I want to let you all know that after 8 years, Mary Winn, our SVP of Investor Relations, will be leaving Dollar General. Her last day will be December 15. I would like to take this opportunity to personally acknowledge Mary Winn and the significant role she has played, not only in building and leading a first-class communication team, but also a trusted adviser to me and the rest of the team. On behalf of everyone here at Dollar General, we thank Mary Winn for all her insights and commitment to our organization. We wish her all the best in her next chapter.  Donny Lau, Vice President of Strategy, along with Kevin Walker, Director of Investor Relations, will oversee our IR function in the interim. As we search for a replacement, we are fortunate to have people like Donny and Kevin on our team who have deep knowledge of the business. I am confident you will enjoy working with them.  With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Mary Pilkington : All right. Go ahead, please, with the first question. Operator : Your first question is coming from the line of Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Alan Rifkin : Mary Winn, you are certainly going to be missed. Thank you for everything over all of these years. Todd, maybe just give us an update on where you stand on the GPV. One would have thought that perhaps with the very strong comp, even including the hurricane expenses, we would've saw maybe a little bit more leverage on the SG&A line. Todd Vasos : Yes, I'll start, and I'll turn it over to John for a little bit more color. But we continue to be very focused on expense control here at Dollar General. And I can tell you that the team has generated a tremendous amount of savings and value this year in 2017. And what I'm happy to report is that we have identified a lot of also savings for the upcoming 2018 time frame that we'll discuss with you on our next call. But I think as you look out, this team has proven over time that we are very cost-conscious as well as reinvesting where appropriate to continue to drive sales. John, you might want to add something? John Garratt : Yes, adding a little more color to that. As you alluded to, while SG&A was up 40 basis points, the hurricane impact of nearly $25 million was 42 basis points. While we did have some headwinds last year, I think it's important to note that the 2 key headwinds this quarter was the ongoing impact of the store manager investment, which, again, we continue to see as a great investment that will pay off for us, and as we get into next year, will no longer be a headwind. And then the other key point is the ramp-up of acquired stores. Again, as we mentioned, we opened a record number of stores this quarter, up 82% over the previous year. And over half -- there's 470 stores, over half of those were new stores, many of which had expenses throughout the quarter as we were opening those up. So those put pressures on that. When you strip that out, we're still in the place we want to be from a leverage standpoint. And as Todd said, that with zero-based budgeting, that's really become ingrained in everything we do here. And I can share you, the team is laser-focused on driving out any and all spending that don't touch our customer, support our strategic initiatives or change our risk profile. So we continue to be very focused on that, as well as gross margin, making the right trade-offs there, while investing in the business and still see ourselves in that same leverage point that we targeted. Alan Rifkin : And just a follow-up, if I may. With respect to wages, certainly, the pressures on your wages are well documented. But maybe, Todd, if you could maybe share with us, as you look to 2018, what incremental wage pressure do you see at the store level? And then also considering your core customer with higher wages being implemented in more and more states via increases in minimum wages, what benefits do you see from that consumer to your business? Todd Vasos : Sure. We -- the one thing about what we've seen on the wage front is we continue to be, right now as we stand today, at our highest level of participation inside of our stores, meaning open positions are at some of the lowest levels we've seen. So we feel very good about where we are as it relates to the wages that we pay. There's no doubt that in certain states and municipalities, we've seen additional wage pressures, but we continue to operate in those environments just like we do everywhere else. As we go into 2018, we believe that some of the increase in wages, whether it be with our core consumer or others, should help continue to benefit the economy in totality, which I believe that with our initiatives that we have in place, we should get more than our fair share of that participation. So we feel good about where the consumer is right now, but as I always say, we work under the premise that she's always tight, because her expenses continue to rise on the other side of expense -- excuse me, of her income rising. So we continue to make sure we're laser-focused on offering value and convenience every day for our consumer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Sean Kras : This is Sean Kras on for Karen. And Mary Winn, you will certainly be missed. Did the comps slow down over the course of the quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense of maybe why the implied fourth quarter guidance is for a slowdown on a 1- and 2-year basis. John Garratt : Yes, if you look at the cadence across the period in the third quarter, every period was positive, but September was the most positive of the quarters period-to-date. I think it's also worth noting that  the balance between both consumables and non-consumables being positive overall. Sean Kras : Okay. And then on the gross margin, could you give us a sense of what that number would have been excluding the acquired stores? Mary Pilkington : I don't know that it really is something with a meaningful impact to that at all. John Garratt : Yes, it wasn't a meaningful impact. So we were pleased to -- we were pleased with the balance of delivering a strong top line and 8 basis points of expansion, but there wasn't a meaningful impact from that on the margin. Todd Vasos : It was a couple basis points at most. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Anthony Bonadio : This is actually Anthony Bonadio on for Ed. Just back on gross margin again. Guidance seems to imply a little compression in Q4, similar to earlier in the year. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes here? How should we be thinking about that? John Garratt : Yes, well, as in the past, we don't guide on gross margin. We really look to make sure we're making the right trade-off between gross margin and SG&A. But what I will say is that as you look at the quarter, Q3, we're pleased to see the gross margin expansion, driven by higher initial markups and shrink improvement. That was the fourth consecutive quarter of shrink improvement. What you didn't see in there is any issues around promos or clearance, that being a non-impact. And what I would say is as we look over the long term, we continue to see opportunities to enhance margins or strategically invest back as needed to drive traffic, but continue to see opportunities around shrink. Even though we've had 4 consecutive quarters, we continue to see opportunity to further improve that. Team continues to do a great job around category management, with more opportunity there. We see opportunity to enhance private label and foreign direct sourcing penetration and continue to see operations -- or opportunities around supply chain efficiencies, despite some pressure from, in the near term, from fuel rates and carrier rates. So over the long term, we continue to see opportunity there, but then also look to strike the right balance between that and managing the levers between gross margin and SG&A to deliver strong operating margin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So Todd, can you speak to some of the learnings from your remodel program to date and just touch on maybe some of the more recent performance that you're seeing in your mature store base? Todd Vasos : Sure. We continue to be very, very encouraged on the remodel program, both our traditional remodels and our remodels that incorporate the additional coolers and in some of those, the entrance of produce in some of those locations. Those locations, in particular, continue to outpace our normal remodel program almost 3x. And that's what gives us great confidence as we expand the remodel program next year up to 400 stores that -- 1,000 stores, excuse me, but 400 of them being under that banner of the larger coolers and in some cases, not all 400, but in some, additional produce. So it continues to do very well. The customers are resonating well. We continue to see that we get about one additional trip in those stores than normal from our core customer because of that expansion of coolers. And by the way, we see expansion in those remodels in health and beauty as well and in some of our non-consumable categories. So all ships in the harbor, if you will, rise within those remodels. Matthew Boss : That's great. And then just a follow-up. I guess larger picture, as we think about the 10% to 15% earnings growth algorithm, I think that you laid out last March, if same-store sales remains in the 2% to 4% target range that they are today, are there any headwind to achieving the 10% to 15% bottom line as we think to next year and beyond? Is that still the algorithm you think that fits with 2% to 4% comps? John Garratt : Yes, we still see that 2% to 4% helps deliver the 10%-plus growth algorithm. And really, we'll be commenting on 2018 when we get to the March time frame, but still see ourselves as double-digit growers and really don't see any meaningful headwinds to that in the near future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So I guess as a bit of a follow-up, maybe to Alan's question from earlier. Given the -- on the wages, given the success that you've seen with the increased training and the increased payroll, does it make sense, in your view, to actually accelerate those investments as you look out to 2018 and 2019, just given the benefits that they've yielded? Or do you think you're pretty happy with kind of the performance that you've seen and there's not going to be incremental investments on that side? Todd Vasos : Yes, we're very happy with the investments that we made in -- here in early 2017. As I indicated, our store manager investments in both compensation and training are really paying off. We're -- what we're very proud about here is that we are seeing lowest turnover rates in recorded history from our store managers. And being an old operator, and I use the term old myself, there is nothing more important than the store manager to the key of any company's success in retail. So I think we made the exact right move in the investment in both the compensation and training. And we don't see -- we think we're in a great spot, based on everything we've seen and heard and continue to see out in the marketplace as far as compensation is concerned. So we don't see another round of large investment there. And we'll continue to monitor it, and we'll continue to ensure that our store managers and all of our employees are taken care of on a compensation basis, where appropriate. Scot Ciccarelli : That's super helpful, Todd. And just a quick follow-up, because John had talked about the comp contribution from new store maturity -- the new store maturity curve. Can you guys just update us in kind of where we are today in terms of the comp contribution from that new store maturity? John Garratt : Yes, so what we've said in the past is when you look at the net impact netted against the cannibalization, it's about 150 to 200 basis points, and we're at the high end of that. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing from that, from sales contribution as well as great returns. Todd Vasos : Yes, our new store program is hitting on all cylinders right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : So there have been a couple of questions around the Q4 guidance. I guess, maybe I'll rephrase it as have you changed your outlook for Q4 within the context of the overall full year guidance? Because it certainly looks like there's this deceleration of fundamentals, based on the implied guide. John Garratt : We continue to see the same strong business fundamentals and feel great about the business, top line, bottom line. If you look at EPS, based on year-to-date performance, we did narrow the guidance on that, raising the bottom end of it $0.02. We only lowered the top end of that $0.03 after taking into account the $0.05 net negative impact from the hurricanes. So if you strip out the hurricane impact, we really see it as a raise on both the top end and the bottom end. And recall, we had indicated previously that Q3 would be the strongest quarter of the year, with Q4 having a more difficult lap, and included in that overlap, an estimated $0.09 benefit last year from the 53rd week. So continue to see things in a similar light. Peter Keith : Okay. A follow-up that's unrelated. But there seems to be a growing drumbeat around potential welfare reform as we look out to 2018. I was wondering if you could provide a historical perspective on when there's been past welfare reform, how that's impacted your business and if there are specific pockets of government subsidy programs that you'd be most concerned about getting cut? Todd Vasos : Yes, obviously, our core customer does rely on assistance in many areas. But the one thing that we see is that if we continue to show our core customer quality and value, give her a reason to shop with Dollar General, she'll shop with us no matter what kind of economic condition is out there. And as we've always said, when times are tough, and they could be tougher if certain things happen along governor -- government assistance, then she needs us more and -- because we offer that great value. So we feel that over time, she figures that out, figures her budget out, and over time, we can continue to deliver a real benefit to her through our everyday low prices and convenience. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : You guys touched on this a little bit in the call, but I just want to circle back to the acceleration that we saw this quarter on both comps and gross margins. It was a really nice acceleration, but certainly, we also recognize that it came against easy compares from a year ago. And so just help us with some additional details, the puts and takes on the sustainability of some of the drivers of comps and gross margins. Particularly, we'd like to hear about some of the initiatives on both the consumable but also the discretionary side of the store. And also, just your outlook around the macro environment and what you're seeing that might be different in terms of just the way the consumer is acting and shopping. Todd Vasos : Yes, Paul, when you look at -- in our top line sales, we delivered exactly what we said we were going to deliver. And we knew that the transitory headwinds that we had called out would start to subside as we moved through third quarter and into the fourth quarter as well. We saw that, but what we also saw was our initiatives really starting to take hold and really make a difference, both on the consumable side and the non-consumable side of the ledger. So it was great to see the teams -- the category management teams have done a great job of working in tandem with our store teams and our marketing teams to get the message out. Our core customer continues to rely on Dollar General very heavily to offer that value, that convenience. And what we continue to do is we continue to be a leader in that, in the channel. And as you look at our initiatives for the balance of '17 and into '18, it really capitalizes, I believe, on what our core strengths are, and exactly it is all put together and executed against what the customer is telling us that she needs. And I think that's the important part of what has made Dollar General successful over the many, many years, is that we really work hand-in-hand with our consumer, and we make the trade-offs inside the store. And sometimes it could be consumables versus non-consumables, depending where she's at in her economic cycle. What we see moving into 2018, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, I think we have a real opportunity to accelerate our non-consumable businesses, especially in areas that the consumer gives us credit for and where she'd like to see enhancements. And stay tuned. As we get into March, we'll talk a little bit more about what those are, but I could tell you that the treasure hunt is what she's looking for, and that's what we're going to be delivering to her as we continue to move forward. So we feel good about that. We feel good about our margins. Our margins, as you continue to look into the back half of this year and into early next year, we have, as John indicated, a lot of levers to continue to work, but we always make sure that we balance that with driving traffic. And I think we've exhibited in Q3 here that we can do both of those. Paul Trussell : And then just looking at the cash and the balance sheet. Just remind us, you guys are, I think, outlined a plan for $450 million or so, I believe, in share repurchase this year, which is, again, materially below some prior year levels. Just remind us, was that very specifically related to kind of the real estate acquisition and projects that you guys took on? And just want to better understand how you guys think about contribution or earnings from buyback going forward. And then also, while I know it's pretty early and hypothetical, given that we are having conversations around tax reform, if that was to flow through in terms of a lower corporate tax rate, how would you think about your investment strategy, your capital plans and your cash usage? John Garratt : Sure. In terms of this year, it was lower than previous years because of the investments, the 2 key investments being the investment we made in store manager pay, which, again, we think was the exact right decision to make and we're seeing the benefits of that, as well as the increased development. Now as I look forward and as we consider tax reform, obviously, we're watching this very closely. As it's currently drafted, the bills are expected to have a material favorable impact to us. Obviously, the likelihood, timing and details of that are uncertain, so I can't comment specifically what we would do here. But what I can tell you is we don't fundamentally see this changing our capital allocation priorities. They've worked very well for us, and we see them working very well for us in the future. And just to remind folks what those are, it's first and foremost, investing in the business. As long as we continue to see great returns on new store growth like we have, that's the best use of our capital. We'll continue to do that, as other -- evaluating other high-return investments in the business. The good news is this business generates a tremendous amount of cash as is, so we do well under any tax code. But with the excess cash, what we do want to do is strike the right balance, pay a competitive dividend and continue to repurchase shares with the excess cash flow up to -- while protecting our investment-grade rating. So I don't see that as fundamentally changing. As things solidify around the tax changes, we can comment on that further in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good luck and best wishes, Mary Winn. Todd, if you had to rank between your initiatives, maybe a more favorable environment and an easier compare, how would you rank those in terms of driving the acceleration in your comps? Todd Vasos : Yes, so when you look at it, I would tell you that our initiatives are really paying off. I would tell you that would be first and foremost. And I think as you look at it, you see those initiatives paying off both in our mature stores, some of the best comp we've seen in our mature store base in many years, and also in our new stores, you see that because remember, our new stores get the best and the brightest, if you will, of all of our initiatives all at one time. So I think your -- I think that would be first and foremost. And then, obviously, some of those headwinds we've been talking about abating would be second on the list. So that's why we feel very good about the positioning we are in right now for Q4 and as we move into 2018. Michael Lasser : And then John, you talked a little bit about what you would do from a capital perspective to the extent that there is tax reform, your tax rate goes down. How would you think about your P&L in that sort of environment? Would you take that as an opportunity to invest more in your margin, lower your margin, and either lower prices or invest more in your stores, if you saw below the line, to boost your profitability? John Garratt : Again, we'll have to wait and see exactly how that comes out, but what I would say is as we see it now, we see ourselves continuing to operate and run the business the same way we have that has worked quite well. Obviously, evaluating situations as we go, but feel pretty happy about the way we're managing all the levers now. Michael Lasser : And I guess a piece of that will depend on what your competitors do. So with that being said, are you seeing any changes in the promotional environment, the pricing environment, that would suggest maybe it's getting better or worse right now? Todd Vasos : No, I would tell you that as far as the competitive environment, it's always competitive in retail. But as you look at it, we really haven't seen a change in the competitive environment in the last few quarters. So it's about where it was. And the great thing is that Dollar General is positioned very well, price-wise, both everyday price and the promotional activity that we have to offer for the consumer. And the other thing that we offer her is a great compelling offering on our digital side. More and more digital engagement is starting to happen here at Dollar General with our core consumer. And as that continues to resonate with our core, you'll continue to see more of that. And I believe that overall, our core customer is responding pretty well to all of the initiatives that we put together here in 2017. And again, that's what gives us great solace as we move into 2018, that we can continue to keep that momentum moving. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : Most of my questions had been asked, but I guess just first, on the fourth quarter implied comp, it doesn't sound like it, but are you seeing anything with your consumer that's giving you guys pause here in the first 5 or 6 weeks of 4Q? And then second, to follow up on Matt's question earlier on the remodel cadence, you're doing 1,000 total projects, 400 are the traditional Plus, and as you alluded to, the comp lift is usually 3x a traditional remodel. So I guess my question is, why not accelerate that pace? What's the potential to -- what's the store potential to roll that traditional Plus out? And then could you shed some light on how many are going to receive produce this year? Todd Vasos : Sure. So as you look at so far in the quarter, yes, we don't see anything that shows us that anything is really changing in the quarter. We feel good about where the comp is. But keep in mind, we have a lot of quarter ahead of us, some of our biggest weeks leading up to Christmas here in the next 3 weeks. And January, traditionally in our channel, is a very good month for us as well. So we'll continue to watch that. Stay tuned. But we feel good about where that comp is headed. As it relates, Chuck, to the remodel program, you're right, 1,000 remodels is on the books for next year, as we indicated. I think that's a very aggressive plan. It really touches a lot of our mature store base. And with 400 of them being in the traditional Plus model, we feel very good about where those comps can head. But one thing to keep in mind on the traditional Plus model is that like our real estate program in general, we are very disciplined on where we put certain stores and what format we put them in, because we've got a proven track record of where they're most successful. And I can tell you that of the 1,000 that we're doing, the 400 that we picked, we feel very good about the success rate that we should see from those 400. We probably have another 2,000 to 3,000 of those opportunities as they exist today. But you know what, as we continue to learn more about what the consumer is buying out of those traditional Plus stores and what they continue to ask us for, that actually could expand. We could see that opportunity could be as high as 5,000, and we're watching that as we speak and we'll continue to monitor it as we move forward. And then produce, we continue to work the produce side, because it is a competitive advantage for us in many areas when we offer produce. I could tell you that out of the 400, probably 25% of them or so will probably have produce as we look at it. But as we continue to learn the produce business, our stores learn more about it, I think there's going to be more and more opportunity for that as well in the upcoming years ahead of us. Mary Pilkington : With that, that will conclude our call for today. Kevin, Donny and I will be around today to do calls, and I look forward to speaking to you. But thank you for your continued support of Dollar General. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Jennifer, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I'm pleased with our strong fourth quarter performance, and the continued momentum we saw in the business. For the full year, we delivered healthy same-store sales growth, driven by an increase in average transaction amount and positive traffic, all while effectively balancing gross margins and exhibiting good underlying expense control. During the year, we continued to make progress on the implementation of our key initiatives as we seek to capture growth opportunities over both the short and long term. Our SG&A investments in 2017 were focused primarily on increased compensation structure and additional training for our store managers, as they play a critical role in our customers' experience and the profitability of each store. We also continue to make proactive and targeted investments in support of key strategic initiatives that we believe will help further differentiate us from the competition over time. I'll provide additional details on 2 of these initiatives pertaining to the digital and nonconsumable strategies later in the call. Now let's recap some of the financial results for fiscal 2017. Full year net sales increased 6.8% to $23.5 billion, compared to net sales of $22 billion in 2016. As a reminder, net sales for 2016 included $398.7 million from the 53rd week. When comparing our fiscal year net sales on a 52-week basis, the fiscal 2017 full year growth rate will be higher by approximately 2 percentage points. Same-store sales for the year increased 2.7% over the prior year, marking our 28th consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. Same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 3.3%, over the prior year fourth quarter, driven by positive performance in both our consumables and nonconsumable categories with stronger growth in consumables. Our highly consumable market share trends in syndicated data continued to exhibit strength, with mid- to high-single digits share growth in both units and dollars over the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending January 27, 2018.  For the full year, diluted EPS was $5.63, and adjusted diluted EPS was $4.49. Fourth quarter diluted EPS was $2.63 with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.48. In 2017, we generated cash from operations of $1.8 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year, while returning $863 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. We continue to deploy capital to invest in new stores, relocations and remodels, while continuing to provide compelling returns. We also invested in infrastructure such as new distribution centers to support future growth.  During the year, we celebrated the grand opening of our 14,000th store, and opened a record 1,315 new stores, which includes the acquisition of nearly 300 store sites in 2017. We also remodeled or relocated a combined 764 stores. In total, we completed 2,079 real estate projects, exceeding our initial target of 1,900 total projects. We continue to be pleased with the returns and performance of our real estate program, as our new stores are overall yielding returns of 20% even prior to the benefit of federal tax reform.  During the fourth quarter, we completed a strategic review of our real estate portfolio. As a result, we closed an incremental 35 underperforming stores, the majority of which were part of our mature store base or stores that we generally define as having been opened 5 years or more. The decision to close stores is always difficult as it impacts our store associates and the communities we serve. Fortunately, we were able to place the majority of impacted employees and direct customers to nearby locations. These 35 store closures resulted in an incremental pretax expense of approximately $28.3 million in the quarter, or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily attributable to the remaining lease liability on these stores. Overall, we believe our real estate portfolio is in excellent shape and that these actions better position us for the future.  Within our distribution network, we completed our 15th distribution center in Jackson, Georgia, and began shipping in October of 2017. During 2017, we started construction on both our 16th and 17th distribution centers in Longview, Texas, and Amsterdam, New York. We expect to begin shipping from these locations in 2019. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network to support our growing store base, while reducing our stem miles. In his remarks, John will review our fiscal results or our financial results for fiscal 2018 guidance, including the benefits of federal tax reform on both. But at a high level, we anticipate a cash benefit of approximately $300 million in 2018 as a result of federal tax reform. Of this amount, we expect [Audio Gap] $75 million in the business this year, while returning the balance to shareholders through additional share repurchases and higher anticipated quarterly dividends.  As you know, one of our ongoing priorities is to enhance our position as a low-cost operator. We have a defined process to address spending that has allowed us to proactively improve our efficiencies and reduce expenses over time. And we are doing this while creating flexibility to reinvest savings to drive growth. We remain committed to this operating priority as well as continuing to make targeted strategic investments in the business for the long term. In fiscal 2018, we anticipate these investments will primarily be focused on the acceleration of our long-term strategic initiatives as well as new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth. Similar to 2017, our planned investments in 2018 are strategically aligned with our 4 ongoing operating priorities. Importantly, we believe we are seeing clear outcomes and benefits from our significant prior year investments, particularly in store manager compensation and training.  We also believe that we remain well positioned, from both a wage and everyday low price perspective, as we have been thoughtfully and proactively investing in these areas all along. As a result, we do not currently anticipate the need to invest heavily in those areas in 2018, which is reflected in our financial guidance for the coming year. Regarding capital allocations, we continue to be disciplined and remain focused on financial returns and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will focus first on investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating. In 2018, our capital spending is prioritized to new stores, remodels and relocations, as well as to our 2 new distribution centers that are currently under construction. Additionally, we have plans to accelerate capital spending on select infrastructure projects and other key initiatives, which we expect to deliver high returns. In summary, we have a long track record of investing in the business, including the significant investments we made in 2017. And while we continue to invest in the business for the short and long term, we expect the majority of the cash benefit from federal tax reform will flow directly through to our earnings and to our shareholders in 2018. We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail, and that we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through the highlights of 2017, let me take you through some of the important financial details of the fiscal quarter and year. I will also spend some time discussing our 2018 guidance.  Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 32.1% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 43 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to higher initial inventory markups, lower inventory shrink and a reductions in markdown, partially offsetting these items were a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sale and increased transportation costs.  SG&A expense increased 159 basis points over the 2016 fourth quarter to $1.3 billion or 21.9% of sales in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2016 was favorably impacted by higher net sales resulting from the fiscal 2016 53rd week.  The 2017 fourth quarter's results reflect increased occupancy costs, increased retail labor expenses given our previously planned investment in store manager compensation and training, and increased incentive compensation costs. We also recorded $28.3 million of additional pretax expense related to 35 incremental store closures in the quarter, most of which were in the form of SG&A expense associated with the remaining lease liability on these stores. Partially offsetting these increased expenses was a reduction in advertising costs.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a benefit of 18.9%, as compared to an expense of 36.8% in the fourth quarter last year. The reduction of the federal corporate tax rate due to federal tax reform resulted in a material positive impact on our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter. This provisional benefit was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet as the new lower federal corporate tax rate, accompanied by benefits associated with the federal corporate tax rate for 2017 of 33.7% compared to 35% in prior years.  Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.63, excluding the $1.15 provisional benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.48. Both our fourth quarter reported and adjusted diluted EPS results include an approximate $0.09 provisional benefit due to the reduced federal corporate income tax rate for 2017. This $0.09 provisional benefit was largely offset by an approximate $0.07 charge from the 35 incremental store closures in the quarter. Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. Merchandise inventories were $3.6 billion at fiscal 2017 year-end, a slight increase of about 1.5% on a per-store basis. As we enter 2018, we believe our inventory is in great shape and are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with or below our sales growth. In 2017, we generated strong cash flow growth from operations totaling $1.8 billion, an increase of $197 million or 12% compared to the prior fiscal year. Total capital expenditures for the year were $646 million, and included the majority of the cost of our Jackson, Georgia, distribution center.  During the quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares of our common stock for $281 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $70 million. For the full year, we returned cash to shareholders totaling $863 million, through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividends. From December 2011, through the end of the 2017 fiscal year, we repurchased $5.1 billion or 81.4 million shares of our common stock. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization, we have remaining authorization of approximately $1.4 billion under the repurchase program. Turning now to our guidance. For fiscal 2018, we anticipate net sales growth of approximately 9% and expect full year comp growth to be in the mid-2% range. As Todd mentioned earlier, in 2018, we plan to accelerate investments in our long-term strategic initiatives. Despite these investments as well as headwinds from increasing wage rates and rising transportation costs, we anticipate our operating margin rate to be relatively unchanged as compared to fiscal 2017.  Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 is forecasted to be in the range of $5.95 to $6.15. Our diluted EPS guidance assumes an estimated effective tax rate of 22% to 23% in 2018, which we expect will result in an incremental cash benefit of approximately $300 million for the year. We plan to invest $50 million to $75 million of our tax savings in the business this year, primarily in capital expenditures to accelerate our strategic initiatives such as digital and nonconsumables, and other high-return projects. Overall, our capital spending in 2018 is expected to be in the range of $725 million to $800 million, as we continue to invest in the business to drive and support future growth.  In terms of cash distribution to shareholders, as we outlined in today's press release, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share, an increase of 12%. In fiscal 2018, we also plan to repurchase approximately $850 million of our common stock. In total, we expect to return over $1.1 billion to shareholders this year through the combination of share repurchases and anticipated quarterly dividends, which represents an increase of more than $250 million compared to the prior year.  As you model 2018, please keep in mind the following : A record 1,315 new store openings in 2017, including acquired stores, were weighted towards the back half of the year and the ramp-up of the later opened stores is expected to pressure SG&A leverage at the beginning of the year. Additionally, our invested store manager compensation trainings began in March of 2017, and this too is expected to pressure SG&A leverage in Q1 before we anniversary the investment from the prior year. Combined, we expect these 2 items to result in an incremental impact of approximately 20 basis points of SG&A deleverage as a percentage of sales in the first quarter. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with a goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while positioning our business for long-term growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing operating priorities to drive profitable state for sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long term shareholder value.  With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. As I've shared with you over the last several quarters, we are investing in and building momentum behind certain strategic initiatives that we believe will ultimately drive strong sales and profit growth in the years ahead. Today, I'll provide an update on our digital and nonconsumable initiatives, which represents 2 of our more near-term strategic opportunities. Starting with our digital initiatives. We are strategically investing in our business to help our customers utilize digital tools and resources for a more personalized and convenient in-store shopping experience. With nearly 75% of the U.S. population currently within 5 miles of a Dollar General, we have a unique opportunity to help shape our customers' digital shopping behavior, all while leveraging our more than 14,500 brick-and-mortar stores to help them save time and money. Our efforts are all about making things easier for customers and further enhancing our strong value proposition, providing a unique combination of value and convenience. Our insights indicate that our customers are utilizing digital more to plan their visits and lot more options on how they engage with us in store. These insights have helped to shape our digital strategy, which we have accelerated. Earlier this week, we launched a customer pilot of our new shop and scan mobile app service in select store locations. This mobile app allows customers to scan items while they shop and pay directly with their phones, allowing for a faster and easier checkout experience. Not only does shop and scan help customers save time it also makes staying on budget easier. Customers can see the price of individual items as they scan them, along with a running total.  In 2018, we have plans to expand this service to additional stores as we continue to enhance our overall value proposition for our consumers.  We see a continued opportunity to improve engagement and build loyalty through the further integration of our traditional and digital media mix. We continue to develop resources to personalize offerings such as digital coupons, tailored for individual customers, and personalized marketing campaigns, which will enable our customers to save even more time and money. Looking ahead, we plan to add more digital tools and services to provide our customers with even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experiences. With the introduction of shop and scan, and over 900 million digital coupons clipped in 2017 by our more than 12 million digital coupon subscriber accounts, we know we have a great foundation on which to build for the future.  Turning to our nonconsumable initiative. In 2018, we plan to test a bold, new and expanded assortment in key categories. Our plans include enhancing the treasure hunt experience by Dollar General, by first, offering a new differentiated and limited assortment that will change throughout the year. Second, displaying the new offering in high-traffic areas to enhance the in-store experience and create a sense of purchase urgency. And third, continue to deliver exceptional value by pricing the majority of our offerings at $5 or below. While we're expanding our assortment in select categories, the space currently dedicated to nonconsumables with our stores is expected to remain the same. We will initially test these changes in approximately 700 store locations, as we look to further complement our strong and growing consumable business. We are excited about our plans and believe we are well positioned to capture market share in a changing retail landscape.  As we execute these growth initiatives, we remain committed to our ongoing operating priorities : first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first operating priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth with a focus on driving both the top and bottom line. Our goal is to both attract and grow new customers and trips, and to capture additional share with existing customers. This includes expanding our merchandising initiatives, which are designed to provide our customers with trusted simple solutions to help them manage their household budgets and provide them with their everyday needs and even more value.  In-store for 2018, we plan to redesign our snack and beverage aisles to create a best-in-retail shopping experience. This change should enhance customer awareness and further position us as a destination retailer for immediate consumption shop through assortments and everyday low prices. Across a select group of stores we'll be introducing an expanded assortment of better-for-you products, with a focus on higher protein and lower salt choices at price points that will be attractive to our customers. We will also continue to strategically invest in our mature store base. We are particularly focused on remodeling stores that had fewer than 12 cooler doors, which in relative terms are expected to drive the highest returns upon remodel. By the end of fiscal 2018, we anticipate that across our store base we'll have an average of 20 cooler doors, up from 10 in 2012. In total, we expect to install over 20,000 additional cooler doors across our mature store base this year, as we continue to build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. Following the success of our health and beauty expansion in 2017, we are launching phase 2 of this initiative. In 2018, we plan to drive overall category awareness with our customers through improved and more impactful displays, consistent messaging in-store as well as across print and digital media, enhanced quality perception and superior shopability. We see significant runway for this category, particularly given our price advantage relative to some other channels. The expansion of private label offerings with a focus on value, quality and appealing packaging will continue to play a role in our category management process in 2018. We know that private brands resonate with our consumer as we deliver the right combination of price and quality. Given the significant price gap compared to national brands and other channels, private brands play an important role in helping our customers stretch their budgets. We have additional ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion that includes improvements in shrink, global sourcing, distribution and transportation efficiencies as well as private brand and nonconsumable sales. Inventory shrink reduction continues to be a large opportunity within gross margin. In addition to other defensive merchandising tactics, leveraging technology and improving process controls, we plan to expand electronic article surveillance, or EAS, to an incremental 5,000 stores in 2018, bringing the total stores with EAS to about 10,000 locations. This is a proven high-return project for us to help further reduce shrink and drive sales by improving on-shelf availability. While we have seen carrier rates and fuel costs on the rise, our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce expenses are expected to help mitigate these costs in 2018. Some of our ongoing initiatives include : further reductions in stem miles, better optimization of our loads and the expansion of our private fleet to around 210 tractors by year-end, up from 80 tractors at the end of 2017. Our goal is to ensure we are highly relevant with our customers through ongoing investments in everyday low prices and targeted promotional activity. Importantly, our pricing surveys continue to indicate Dollar General is well positioned from a price perspective against all classes of trade and across all geographic regions where we operate. We are committed to being priced right, every day for our customers, to drive traffic to our stores. Our focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities is our second priority. We have a proven high-return, low-risk model for our real estate growth. Our flexible real estate model allows us to -- the ability to invest in new store growth, enter new markets, deliver new formats and reinvest in our mature store base. We constantly monitor new store productivity and returns to ensure new store growth is the best use of our capital, focusing on the following 5 metrics : First, new store productivity as a percent of our comp store sales; second, actual sales performance compared to our pro forma model; third, average returns of 20% to 22%, which is an increase compared to our prior target of 18% to 20% due to the benefit of federal tax reform; fourth, cannibalization of our new stores on our comp store base and finally, a payback period of less than 2 years. We continue to be very pleased with the overall returns on our new stores as we remain committed to investing our capital effectively to drive strong financial returns. For 2018, we expect to open 900 new stores, remodel 1,000 of our mature store locations and relocate approximately 100 stores. That's about 2,000 projects in total as we continue to deploy capital to these high-return investments. Of the 1,000 planned store remodels for 2018, we expect approximately 400 locations to be in the Dollar General traditional Plus format, bringing the total traditional Plus store count to about 750 by year-end. These remodels incorporate a cooler set of 34 doors for increased perishable selections. Our cooler door expansion has proven to drive baskets and trips with our existing customer base, while also attracting new customers with an expanded offering. Additionally, across about 1/3 of these locations, we are including an assortment of fresh produce, bringing the total number of Dollar General stores with produce to around 450 by year-end. While it's still early, prior year traditional Plus remodels are yielding strong same-store sales results. The ability to offer produce, particularly in the areas with limited grocery availability, represents an attractive growth opportunity for Dollar General in the years ahead.  Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years we have established a clear and defined process to control spending. All of our spending is filtered through 3 criteria : first, is it customer-facing; second, does it align with our strategic priorities; and third, how does it impact our risk profile. At the store level, our operational initiatives for 2018 are centered on space optimization and ongoing efforts to simplify our operation by reducing unproductive inventory, operating complexity and product movement within the stores. These actions are designed to control costs and allow our store managers and their teams to invest time savings to provide better customer service as well as fast, clean and an in-stock shopping experience. We also have a continued focus on improving the speed of check out, with a goal of reducing transaction time by an average of 3 seconds. To put this in perspective, a reduction of 3 seconds on each of our nearly 2 billion annual customer transactions would result in over 1.6 million hours in additional time savings for our store teams each year. These time savings can be reinvested by our store managers to deliver a higher level of customer service, which ultimately helps to improve sales. To advance our objective of reducing transaction time, in addition to our shop and scan offering, we are establishing optimal transaction time for each store based on individual store attributes. We are also tracking customer satisfaction scores at the individual employee level, which increases accountability and creates opportunities for employee recognition. Our ability to drive execution across our large and growing store base is a key strength of Dollar General. At the store support center, work elimination and process improvement are ongoing efforts to take cost out of the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, control expenses and always seek to be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are our competitive advantage. We believe the significant investment in store manager compensation and training we made in 2017 is paying off, as we experienced our lowest level of store manager turnover in 5 years. And for the first time in several years, we are seeing a reduction in both assistant manager and store associate turnover. Importantly, the reduction in store level employee turnover are accompanied by an increase in both store manager and hourly applicant flow, which is up substantially over the same prior year period. These results further support our belief we continue to be well positioned from a wage perspective. And since we have already made wage investments, we can use the vast majority of the benefit from tax reform to invest in other areas of the business and return additional cash to shareholders. We will continue to monitor the environment and invest as needed to ensure we remain competitive in the labor market. For the seventh consecutive year, Dollar General was named to Training Magazine's top 125 training list, ranking in the overall top 5 and the highest ranked major retailer on their most recent 2018 list, which represents our highest ranking to date. We are proud of our 10,000-plus store managers, who have been internally promoted and are excited about how engaged our workforce is across the business. I believe this has helped to contribute to our improvement in overall customer satisfaction scores, which continue to improve throughout 2017 and ended at their highest level of the year. In 2018, we will continue to invest in our employees and remain committed to providing attractive career growth opportunities. As we announced last week, we are extending paid parental leave benefits and providing adoption assistance for eligible employees throughout the company. Additionally, we plan to create over 7,000 new jobs as a result of our 900 planned new store openings. We are confident that we remain in a leadership position to attract and retain the right talent, and we will continue to invest in our people as we believe they are our competitive advantage. In closing, we are cautiously optimistic about economic conditions. It is always challenging for our core customer. So regardless of the economic outlook for our consumer, our goal is to do everything we can to provide her with a great shopping experience and to deliver the value and convenience she expects from Dollar General. I want to thank each of our nearly 130,000 employees across the company for all their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. As a team, we look forward to 2018 as we build on our strong performance from 2017. With that, Jennifer, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Vinnie Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Michael Kessler : This is -- it's actually Michael on for Vinnie. So wanted to ask, actually, about that reinvestment rate, which I think kind of averaged out to around 20%, 25%. So that rate is maybe bit on the lower side compared to some of your peers in retail and obviously, you guys have been way ahead of the curve with investments in stores and labor. So wondering, kind of, about the thought process how you came to that number? And then also, is that kind of incremental spending or kind of pull forward of future, kind of, planned investments? John Garratt : Yes, so as Todd mentioned, as we come into the year because we've been proactively investing all along, we feel we're in a great spot. When you look at the investments we made last year in store manage -- store manager pay it's performing as we expected as we see higher applicant flow, higher staffing levels, lower turnover and we're seeing the financial benefits of that with better customer satisfaction, better sales and start to see the lower shrink. We're well positioned also on pricing. So as you look at those areas we feel we're well positioned. We really saw this as an opportunity to continue to accelerate strategic initiatives in high return projects. So in addition, as you look at how we're breaking that down this year, in addition to investing in 2,000 real estate projects, both the high return new stores as well as the remodels with additional cooler capacity, which is driving great the sales benefit and the supporting infrastructure, we see an ability to accelerate the strategic initiatives as Todd mentioned, digital and nonconsumables, to mention 2 of them and other high-return projects like EAS, which is helping us so much with shrink, expanding our private fleet to help mitigate risks around transportation costs and LED lighting, which helps to save utility cost. So we a lot of opportunities to accelerate these, help the business and feel we're very well positioned and are comfortable with the allocation here. And it allows us to return a considerable amount of money back to the shareholders in the form of a competitive dividend and share repurchases. Michael Kessler : Great. And actually just a quick follow up on, kind of, just mentioned about the, kind of, increasing transportation cost. Wonder if you could may be kind of quantify that, or if you kind of -- what you see the cadence of that headwind looking, kind of going through 2018? John Garratt : Yes, we didn't quantify the impact of that, but what I would tell you, as you look at our guidance for the year around overall operating margin, that is factored in. And that is one of the key headwinds that we're overcoming, but still we see ourselves in a position to despite headwinds like that and the targeted investments we talk about keep our operating margin rates level. We have offsets within that and within gross margin overall. The good thing is there's a lot of levers within gross margins. Within transportation costs, as we mentioned, we're reducing stem miles, we're optimizing our loads, we're expanding our private fleet to help mitigate that as well as other productivity initiatives in the distribution center. And then, of course, we have other levels -- levers within gross margin such as shrink, very pleased with the shrink performance there, 5 consecutive quarters of shrink improvement as the process improvement, the store manager pay and the investments we've made pay off. And the team does a phenomenal job on our product's category management and see continued opportunity to expand private-label penetration, form-sourcing penetration, as well as grow our nonconsumable. So we see a lot of opportunities to help offset that pressure. Operator : Your next question is from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : I -- actually there's 2 of them. The first was just, you guys in the press release called out that traffic comp was slightly negative and if I recall, it was, I think it was accelerating in the third quarter. I was hoping you could maybe tell us on, was there a change in trend in the fourth quarter, or maybe discuss that with us a little bit. Todd Vasos : Sure. As you look at the fourth quarter, we strategically look year-over-year at our promotional activity. The main driver of the little bit of the slowdown that we saw in traffic was really a little bit of a pullback in our promotional activity. And quite frankly, it was in one big promotion that we ran the year prior in November, leading in to the baking season before Thanksgiving. So when you factor that in, and then our position, that we'll continue to work all levers and deliver profitable sales growth, we saw a little bit of a slowdown there. But again, it was intentional and quite frankly not completely unplanned. So we feel good about the long-term prospects of driving traffic. As we look at our 2018 initiatives, they are as robust as ever. And I would tell you that I'm very excited about our strategic initiatives and especially, the 2 that I outlined in the call today to help continue to drive that traffic for many years to come. Robert Ohmes : And just, the other question was in the fourth quarter, maybe it's related to the pullback in the promo activity, but I was curious where you're seeing less markdowns in the fourth quarter versus last year. John Garratt : Yes, it really stems from the promotional activity. We've gotten very targeted on the promotional activity, and as particularly as we see the headwinds ease, and the initiatives performing well has just been very targeted around our markdown. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So I want to talk about your sales, I think you guys are guiding to the mid-2s in relation to, kind of, all the initiatives you have going and what looks like probably a little bit stronger inflation backdrop. And I just wanted to say, are you -- you're kind of being conservative there? I mean, just trying to gauge, it seems like every company is baking in additional costs related to the tax cut but no one is really talking too much about sales. I'm just wondering if you could give us -- how are things going and what are you thinking about that mid-2% guide? Todd Vasos : We're squarely focused on driving that top line, and we believe over the long term 2%-plus is definitely where we can drive. And the 2.5% that we're guiding to is our best estimate at this point, as we look for the whole year. In saying that, we always strive, we're retailers, we always strive for more and we'll continue to drive that top line and again, balance that with profitable sales growth at the same time. So stay tuned, but as I said earlier, I'm very encouraged on our 2018 shorter-term initiatives as well as those longer-term initiatives to sustain a nice comp as we move out into future quarters and years. So stay tuned, but I can tell you that our merchant team is squarely focused on driving as much comp as we possibly can as we move through 2018. Scott Mushkin : So my follow-up question, along the same lines. I know you guys are expanding -- health and beauty care is one of the key initiatives and of course, the treasure hunt. I was wondering if you could actually size a little bit for us, the health and beauty care expansion, how many stores this year will be -- have the larger set? And then on the treasure hunt, I think you said 700 stores. When does that start? Could you size it from an SKU perspective? Todd Vasos : Yes, sure, I'll try to size it up. On the health and beauty front, this is the second year of this initiative. And this initiative really goes across the majority if almost not all of our stores. It will touch pretty much all of them as we move through 2018. And we have a unique position here, we have created a very nice niche for ourselves for our consumers in both health and beauty, especially on that health side of the equation. And I can tell you that our prices are very, very favorable compared to other classes of trade there. And our private brand penetration is amongst the strongest in some of those categories that we see across all of our categories that we have private brands in. So it's going to be an initiative that will touch all stores. As we look at our longer-term initiative of the nonconsumable initiative you mentioned, the 700 stores, that initiative will kick off middle of the year and we'll continue to put stores in as we move towards Q3 as well. But as we continue to see momentum in that, which we anticipate, we'll be able to take pieces of that initiative early on and start to implement them in the chain itself as we start to see things start to materialize in a real positive way, again, which we anticipate seeing. I could tell you, on a SKU basis, there'll be hundreds of new SKUs that will be in this. It is a whole different way of going about our nonconsumable business. And I think it's very smart because as you look at how the consumer is shopping today, and you know us pretty well, we've always been on the forefront of changing as the consumer changes, she's looking for more of a treasure hunt. She's looking for something new and unique in her shopping experience, especially as it relates to nonconsumables. And we believe that this will deliver exactly what she's looking for. So stay tuned, more to come, we'll tell you, as time goes, how that initiative is progressing. But we're looking for some big things out of this as we move forward. Operator : Your next question is from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Gregory Melich : I just wanted to follow up on gross margins. You have mentioned some of the drivers that could help this year and going forward, private label, foreign sourcing. Could you give us an update on where you are right now, percentage of volume or sales that is private label, and also what the import percentage is? And call out China, in particular, especially what you might do if tariffs come into play? Todd Vasos : Sure. On our private brands, we continue to see penetration rates between that 22 and 24 percentage points, and that's overall. Some category is much higher than that, obviously. But we still see it right in that wheelhouse, and we feel good about that amount of percentage. We're always looking to increase that. And again, I think as we look at 2018, the initiatives around private brands are as strong as I've seen them in the last couple of -- 3 years. So we feel good about being able to add to that. As far as global sourcing is looking at, we still believe we've got somewhere in that $4 billion to $5 billion opportunity, on a cost of good basis to bring more goods in through our 4 sourcing efforts. We, like most, are still predominantly China-centric. I wouldn't say all, but I could tell you that over the last 3 years, our reach into other countries has grown tremendously. And we're now in double digits in the amount of countries that we actually export out of. And that will continue to grow over time because we see the opportunity to move some of the goods out of China into other areas that have a very competitive price, and have the infrastructure available to meet our needs and to get the goods over here on a timely basis. So more to come there. But I can tell you that our global sourcing folks are squarely focused on moving the needle on our percentage and on the amount that we bring into the country. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Todd, can you give us -- can you quantify what you assumed for an average wage rate, maybe an average fuel price into your guidance? I think there's going to be a lot of debate as the year progresses, if you see the wage environment speed up and diesel prices start to put more pressure on your transportation costs. Might you have to make some additional investments above and beyond what you finished -- originally planned for, so it would be helpful to kind of help frame that. Todd Vasos : Yes. As we look in 2018 and our guidance reflects what our current thoughts are, and where we think the business is headed, we feel very good about where we are on wages today. When you look at the investments that we made last year on our store managers and by the way, the investments we made last year even in our hourly rates, not only the 16 to 18 states and municipalities that mandated a different rate, but also to stay competitive in certain markets we have upped the rates across the board, we feel that we've been able to manage those very well. And we believe we can manage that in 2018 very well. Our applicant flow is at the highest we've seen in many years and with our turnover being down and at the lowest rate that we've seen in the last 5 years, we feel very, very confident that, and very competitive in our wage structure and rates and be able to staff our stores appropriately. So right now we don't see a large need to invest heavily, but we will always invest where we believe we think we need to, to continue to stay competitive. As we look at gross margin, especially as you indicated with our fuel price is on the rise and the carrier rates on the rise, our team has done a great job in supply chain over the years in anticipating, because let's admit it, fuel prices overall, while up recently, they're still not at their highs that they were a few years ago, we know that fuel rates are going to rise. And our teams have been always proactive about ways to mitigate those fuel cost rises. And the team is really doing a nice job. Now we're not going to be able to mitigate all of it but a portion of it. And then again, with our private fleet and the expansion of that, we feel that taking advantage of the private fleet will also give us a distinct advantage in some of these carrier rate increases that we're seeing. So more to come, but again, in our guidance, we feel that we've nailed it pretty good right now, but like we always say, we always reserve the right to invest where we need to, whether it be pricing, whether it be wages or others to continue to drive this business. Michael Lasser : That's very helpful, and I have one follow-up on your guidance. You're looking for a mid-2% comp this year. That would represent a slowdown from what you saw in 2017, the full year basis. Despite the fact that last year you did -- you were dragged down by deflation and some of the changes to the SNAP program. So why wouldn't this year be better than last year, particularly as you see traction with some of your initiatives? Todd Vasos : As you -- as I mentioned earlier and you look at our comp, we're very happy where comp came in, in Q4. And as we look to 2018, we gave our best estimate to what we thought full year '18 is going to look like. But again, we're retailers and arguably we're one of the best out there driving that top line and balancing the margin components of that as well. So we'll continue to try to strike that fine balance, but we'll always try to drive that higher comp as we move through the year. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Regarding SG&A overall, you highlighted, I believe, 20 basis points of deleverage in 1Q, and you called out occupancy and still needing to lap the store manager compensation increase from last year as the factors driving that. But -- so should we assume more flattish levels of SG&A rate as we move through the balance of the year? And specific to 1Q, are there enough GP -- or gross margin tailwinds to more than offset that aforementioned 1Q SG&A headwind? John Garratt : Yes, so as we mentioned in our call, in Q4 and going into Q1, there was some noise putting some short-term pressure on our SG&A. But the way we look at it, our goal remains to leverage SG&A at a sales comp of 2.5% to 3% over time. As we indicated in our guidance, we really look at operating margin overall, looking to manage all the levers within both gross margin and SG&A, team does a great job of making the right trade-offs there. And as we said in our guidance, we see that overall being even for the year, and we do see as we work through some of the noise of Q4 and the front half of Q1, SG&A normalizing. Paul Trussell : And on the gross margin for 1Q? John Garratt : Yes, so we didn't call any specifically around gross margin, but we just -- again we focus on the long term and making the right trade-offs. But again, in our guidance for the year, when we look at the 2 in total, we see our ability to keep that rate even with last year, while making targeted investments, offsetting some headwinds with all the levers at our disposal, we feel comfortable with the guidance we've provided. Paul Trussell : Fair enough. And then lastly, from me, just circling back to same-store sales. Just want to be clear on what drove the strength in ticket in 4Q. It certainly sounds like there's a little bit less of promotions and also had some markups, but still a big number. If you can touch on that. And then just going forward, as we think about same-store sales in 2018, do you have an expectation that traffic in the home and apparel categories will positively contribute? Todd Vasos : So as you look at our sales, we were very pleased, as you indicated, we came out with a very strong comp in Q4, and that was primarily driven by our initiatives. And those initiatives will continue to carry on as we move into the first half of this year, and you couple that with our new initiatives in 2018, that's what gives us the confidence as we move into '18 in that 2.5% plus range. So I think it's really -- everything that we've always done here, and that is having strong initiatives leading into the year, and then leveraging those as we move through the fiscal year. I see it no different for 2018. And as you look at it, it was really comprised of those initiatives. Inflation actually was up very flattish, if not down a little bit, in Q4 for us. So it really wasn't inflation that drove that. And then when you look at the transactions as well as the traffic, when you look at transactions, we've been doing a lot to move the needle on getting a fuller shop for our consumer. While we're still very convenient based, and it's definitely a fill-in shop, having her be able to pick up an additional item through our offering is starting to pay off, and we're seeing that within our numbers. And she's been able to do a little bit of a fuller shop as she comes to us. You couple that ability with the little bit extra money in her pocket that she has, and that's usually a winning combination. Operator : Your final question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Ryan Kilbane : This is Ryan Kilbane on for John. So the strength in traffic generating categories seems like it's not really translating into the sale of more discretionary items. So I'm just wondering is that a function of merchandise content, value or execution? And is this something you guys expect from your strategic initiatives from the treasure hunt to help drive? Todd Vasos : As you look at our nonconsumable business, we always have said that consumables will drive the traffic and will round out the basket with the nonconsumable goods. And that played out in seasonal but didn't play out in the couple of the other areas in Q4. And that's where we're squarely focused both in our short-term initiatives, leading into 2018, but also those longer-term initiatives, that nonconsumable initiative that I talked about. It could really have the juice to really move the needle long term as we move through '18 and then into '19 because of the different type of the shop that we're really moving after in nonconsumables. Always remember, the consumer changes and her preferences change over time. And we retailers that recognize that quickly, as Dollar General does, and then moves quickly as we do can take advantage of that. And that's exactly what we're doing over 2018. And then moving into the long term '19 and '20, we believe we've positioned ourselves well to capitalize. Ryan Kilbane : Okay, and then -- and there's a quick follow up. Initial productivity seemed to fall a little bit in the quarter, kind of relative to historical levels. Can you talk a little bit about that? And then what might be driving, I guess, the implied step up a little bit in 2018 in terms of the implied productivity? John Garratt : So we continue to be -- we haven't seen a material change in the performance of the stores. We -- as we've said before, we follow a basket of metrics. We continue to see the new store productivity in that 80% to 85% range, continue to see the stores' sales and returns perform as hoped, continue to see our returns at the high end of the 18% to 20% range and now with the benefit of tax reform that would be more like a 22%, continue to see a quick payback, continue to see cannibalization as expected, relatively level and less than one would expect, just given the proximity of the shop. So -- no, we feel great about the performance of the new stores and we're very excited about that full pipeline of new 900 stores we'll open this year.

[Operator Instructions] Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Jennifer, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We had a solid first quarter and we're off to a good start in the second quarter. During the first quarter, we delivered strong net sales growth, gross margin expansion and expense containment. We remain on track with our full year guidance. Specifically with regard to first quarter EPS, we believe we are right where we need to be. During the first quarter, we delivered 2.1% same-store sales growth, driven by fundamental improvement in customer productivity as illustrated by increases in both average units and dollars per basket. Importantly, we achieved this growth despite facing unseasonably cold and damp weather, which created a sales headwind. We also built momentum within each of our 4 operating priorities, and we believe that our execution on these and our progress against key strategic initiatives are laying the foundation for long-term growth.  Now let's recap some of the top line results for the first quarter. Net sales increased 9% to $6.1 billion compared to net sales of $5.6 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Our same-store sales increase of 2.1% reflects strong performance in the consumable category. We continue to gain market share in highly consumables over the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending May 5, 2018, according to syndicated data. We are committed to being priced right for our customer every day, and believe we remain well positioned against all classes of trade and across all geographic regions in which we operate. We believe our everyday low-price commitment has contributed to our share gains. While it's always competitive in discount retail, we continue to see rational pricing activity across the industry. As we continue to execute against our operating priorities, we believe we have the opportunities to continue to capture market share. Our first quarter comp included the impact of unseasonable weather in late March and April, which we believe negatively impacted our nonconsumable categories, particularly among spring and summer products. Consumables, which represents 75% of our business, were also impacted by weather, although still comped at a very healthy rate during the first quarter. To give you a little more insight into the magnitude of the weather impact, midway through the first quarter, our comp sales were tracking ahead of our full-year guidance. In fact, we achieved our highest comp sales for the quarter in March. Our comp sales in April, however, were negative. As we moved out of April and through, now, into May, the unfavorable weather subsided, and we are encouraged by the strong start to our second quarter. Based on our year-to-date results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reiterating our full year 2018 financial guidance in its entirety. After John's comments, I will share some further insights on how we plan to continue driving growth in 2018 and beyond. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the first quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. I will also spend time reviewing our 2018 guidance. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. As Todd has already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. We were pleased to deliver gross profit expansion in the first quarter. Gross profit as a percent of sales was 30.5% in the first quarter, an increase of 17 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to higher initial markups on inventory purchases and improved rate of inventory shrink. These factors were partially offset by a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories; the sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumable sales; and increased transportation costs. SG&A expense as a percent of sales was 22.4%. This was an increase of 60 basis points. The first quarter of 2018 SG&A results were driven by increased retail labor expenses, occupancy costs, utilities expenses and property taxes on leased stores, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. The vast majority of the deleverage in the SG&A rate was primarily due to 2 factors. First, the previously announced expenses associated with the store manager investments and the ramp-up of the stores opened in the second half 2017; and second, the unseasonably cold and damp weather that negatively impacted sales and drove higher-than-expected utilities expenses. The operating margin rate for the quarter would have been flat if not for those investments in the weather. Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6%. This was largely aligned with our full year guidance of 22% to 23%, which we are reiterating for the full year. This compares to 37.2% in the first quarter of 2017. Finally, diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.36. We had a solid balance sheet and a track record of generating strong cash flow from operations. Merchandise inventories were $3.6 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018, up 8.9%, but slightly below our net sales growth. Inventory growth was relatively flat on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape, and we remain focused on managing inventory growth to be in line with or below our sales growth. In the first quarter, we generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $549 million, an increase of $38 million or 7.5%. This strong growth was on top of the 26% year-over-year increase we reported in the first quarter of 2017. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $165 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, continued investments in our 2 distribution centers under construction and spending related to previously announced acceleration of some key initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $150 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $78 million. Through the end of the first quarter, we returned cash to shareholders totaling $228 million through the combination of these share repurchases and quarterly dividends. From the inception of our share repurchase program in December 2011 to the first quarter of 2018, we have repurchased $5.3 billion or 83 million shares of our common stock. At the end of the first quarter, the remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $1.2 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged as we continue to be disciplined and focused on financial returns. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth. We remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends, while maintaining our current investment-grade ratings and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. Turning now to our guidance. As Todd highlighted, we are off to a solid start during the first 4 months of 2018. Based on this performance and our outlook for the rest of the year, we are reiterating our fiscal 2018 full-year guidance, including net sales growth of approximately 9%, comp growth in the mid-2% range, operating margin rate relatively unchanged compared to the 2017 fiscal year and diluted earnings per share for the full year in the range of $5.95 to $6.15. Given the puts and takes of sales growth and margin rate this year, we want to provide a little more insight on the trajectory of our expectations. First starting with the sales. We're off to a good start in the second quarter, but bear in mind, the second quarter comp lap tends to get tougher relative to the first quarter. Also, as a reminder, in the second half 2017, we opened 741 new stores, driven by the acquisition of the Dollar Express locations, which is a much higher number than our typical cadence. As a result, in the second half of 2018, we will have an unusually high number of stores rolling into the comp base. The anticipated positive impact of these stores helps offset the tougher comparisons we faced in the second half. This positive impact is contemplated in our full-year guidance. Second, looking at gross margin. We continue to see freight and fuel headwinds. But as a reminder, we begin to lap these pressures in the second half of the year. The team is executing strategies that we believe can help mitigate the impact of these headwinds over time. We remain committed to our everyday low price strategy, which we believe is a competitive advantage. To that end, and as part of our ongoing operating philosophy, we routinely monitor our price position and make adjustments as necessary. Our full-year outlook includes the expected gross margin impact of any known challenges in these areas. Turning to SG&A. As a reminder, for modeling purposes, our long-term goal is to leverage SG&A on an annual basis in the range of 2.5% to 3% same-store sales growth. It is not our strategy to leverage SG&A at lower comp levels as we expect to continue to make targeted investments in the business. Additionally, as we have said previously, we are focused on operating margin growth, which allows us to dynamically make choices that enable us to do what is right for the longer-term health of the business. Finally, regarding EPS. I would remind you that in the third quarter of 2017, we saw a $0.05 estimated net negative impact to diluted EPS due to the hurricanes. As always, we are focused on carefully controlling costs even as we make targeted proactive investments. We continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while positioning our business for long-term growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ability to drive profitable same-store sales growth, deliver healthy new store returns, generate strong cash flow from operations and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. Let me now walk through how we are executing against our operating priorities and initiatives for 2018, as well as update you on the progress on our long-term strategic initiatives. Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. With the focus on driving both the top and bottom lines, we expect our most impactful top line initiatives for 2018 to revolve around merchandising and store operations. These initiatives are designed to enhance the value and convenient proposition for our customers, offering them the trusted simple solutions they seek from us every day. We continue to strategically invest in our mature store base. We are practically focused on remodeling stores that have fewer than 12 cooler doors. These store remodels typically drive amongst the highest returns. By the end of fiscal 2018, we anticipate that across our store base, we will have an average of 20 cooler doors, up from 10 in 2012. Through the end of the first quarter, we have installed nearly 7,000 additional cooler doors across our mature store base. In total, we expect to install over 20,000 additional cooler doors across our mature store base this year. We know the expansion of coolers tends to drive trips and basket size. As a result, we expect to build on our multi-year track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. We have been enhancing the in-store experience by adding shoppable queue lines. This update allows us to merchandise the check lane with compelling point-of-purchase items that we believe are interesting to our consumers. During the first quarter, we added this enhancement to over 500 stores, bringing our total for the chain to approximate 6,000 stores. The queue line retrofit performance has been very strong. We expect to have this enhancement in over 7,000 stores by the end of 2018. Moving on the success of Phase 1 launch of our health and beauty initiative in 2017, we are launching Phase 2 in 2018. As reminder, during Phase 1, we focused on building awareness among our current customers. With our special combination of value and convenience within health and beauty items, we believe we can do even a better job marketing these products to customers who routinely come to Dollar General for their shopping needs. In Phase 2, we want to build on the increased category awareness we created during Phase 1 by further enhancing the quality perception of the health and beauty products we offer. Some of our actions include improving our display quality, connecting our in-store merchandising with our print and digital media, and creating an easier shopping experience. Given our price position compared to other channels, we believe we can capture share of wallet with our existing customers, as well as identify innovative ways to drive new customers into our stores. We plan to execute Phase 2 in about 7,000 stores in 2018. Another initiative I want to mention within merchandising is our efforts in private brands. Our private brands strategy focuses on enhancing product perception and demonstrating the unique nature, superior value and quality compared to national brands. We intend to use our in-store merchandising expertise to highlight the value pricing and our 100% satisfaction guarantee, as we believe both resonate with our customers. We currently have approximately 40 unique private brand product lines. Our goal is to ensure that we are offering compelling value-priced alternatives to national brands. Given the significant price gap compared to national brands and other channels, private brands play an important role in helping our customers stretch their budgets. Within our merchandising initiatives, we also have many new and exciting resets planned for 2018. Let me briefly highlight 2 of them. First, we recently launched a Better For You offering intended to provide our customers with healthier consumable options at affordable prices. Over time, we expect this offering to include more than 130 products. Within Better For You, we are launching a new private brand called Good and Smart, which will represent approximately 75% of the total Better For You portfolio. Our goal is to build Good and Smart into a unique private brand that becomes a go-to product line for our customers when they look for good food choices at smart prices. Second, we are rebranding our private beauty product portfolio under the name Studio Selection. Our goal with Studio Selection is to create an aspirational yet affordable line of products that will help us further build loyalty and excitement among key demographics. We believe these attractively packaged quality products can help us capture even more market share. These are just 2 of the exciting launches we have planned throughout the rest of the year. We look forward to updating you on the success of our merchandising initiatives throughout the rest of 2018. Let's now turn to the important work of our store operation team. A large part of their current focus is increasing on-shelf product availability. This critical metric is paramount for our customer and is directly tied to sales growth. The team has done an excellent job of improving on-shelf availability and has further improved store cleanliness and speed of checkout, all important parts of the in-store experience. As a result of this execution, we have seen customer satisfaction grow since we began measuring this metric. This is one of our most important metrics, and we believe we can drive it even higher and cultivate even more affinity from our customers over time. Turning for a moment to gross margin. Over the long term, we believe there are several opportunities to enhance gross margin. These includes further reductions in shrink, additional contribution from global sourcing, private brands and nonconsumable sales, as well as achieving additional distribution and transportation efficiencies. Inventory shrink reduction remains our largest near-term gross margin opportunity, and we are executing on multiple fronts. Our comp initiatives include deploying defensive merchandising tactics, leveraging technology and new process controls, and expanding article -- electronic article surveillance, or EAS. This year, we are on track to deploy 5,000 new units, bringing the total stores with this technology to about 10,000 locations. The majority of this year's incremental units were completed during the first quarter. EAS is a proven high-return project for us to help further reduce shrink and drive sales by improving on-shelf availability. We believe that our EAS investment can deliver multiple years of benefit. While we have seen carrier rates and fuel costs on the rise, we believe our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce expenses can partly offset our expense and our exposure to these headwinds. Some of our ongoing initiatives include reducing our stem mile, improving our load optimization, growing and diversifying our carrier base and expanding our private fleet. Our 16th and 17th distribution centers are currently under construction in Longview, Texas and Amsterdam, New York. We anticipate that both of these DCs will open in the 2019 calendar year and that we will see relatively quick and positive impact on stem miles. I was recently at our newest distribution center in Jackson, Georgia for their grand opening celebration. The team in Jackson is excited and engaged, and we look forward to their contribution to our future performance. We also remain on pace to expand our private fleet to over 200 tractors by year-end, up from 80 tractors at the end of 2017. Over time, we believe this will give us added flexibility and help insulate us from future carrier rate fluctuations. Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. We have a proven real estate growth model that is high return, low cost and low risk. While our real estate model has strict return thresholds, it provides us with the flexibility necessary to dynamically invest in both growing our new store base and remodeling our mature store base. These strategic investments have allowed us to enter new markets and store formats, while extending our runway for long-term growth. As a reminder, we closely monitor 5 core metrics to ensure that new store growth continues to be the best use of our capital. First, new store productivity as a percent of our comp store sales, which continues to average in the range of 80% to 85%; second, actual sales performance compared to our pro forma models; third, average returns of 20% to 22%; and fourth, cannibalization of our new stores on our comp store base, which has remained relatively consistent in our measurement; and then finally, new stores must have a payback period of 2 years or less.  We have consistently hit our goals for these metrics. We are very pleased with our overall new store returns, and we remain committed to investing our capital effectively to drive strong financial returns. For 2018, we expect to open 900 new stores, remodel 1,000 of our mature stores and relocate approximately 100 stores. That's about 2,000 stores in total. Of the 1,000 planned remodels, we expect approximately 400 locations to be in the Dollar General Traditional Plus format, or DGTP, for short. This format has a higher cooler count that can accommodate more perishable items. We are on track to achieve these goals by the end of the year. During the first quarter, we opened 241 stores, remodeled 322 stores and relocated an additional 31 stores. 125 of the stores remodeled in the first quarter were in the DGTP format. We included a fresh produce section in 45 of these remodels. As a reminder, our remodeled store delivers a 4% to 5% comp lift on average and the DGTP remodel delivers an average of 10% to 15% comp lift. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending. All of our spending is still through 3 criteria : first, is it customer-facing; second, does it align with our strategic priorities; and third, how does it impact our risk profile. At the store level, our operational initiatives for 2018 are centered on space optimization and ongoing efforts to simplify our operations by reducing unproductive inventory, operating complexity and product movement within the stores. These actions are designed to control costs and allow our store managers and their teams to provide better customer service, as well as fast, clean and in-store in-stock shopping experience. All of these actions can help drive higher sales. We are tracking customer satisfaction scores at the individual employee level, which increases accountability and creates opportunities for employee recognition. At the store support center, work elimination and process improvement are ongoing efforts to take cost out of the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, control expenses and always seek to be a low-cost operator. Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people, as we believe they are a competitive advantage. We believe we are well positioned from a wage perspective across our employee base. That said, we monitor market-by-market and act as needed to ensure we remain competitive in the labor markets where we operate. This proactive strategy, coupled with the career opportunities we offer associates, continues to reinforce Dollar General's position as an employer of choice. The career opportunity we offer is our most important currency in attracting and retaining talent. With our business growing each year, we are providing opportunities for individuals around the country to grow their careers and make improvements in their lives and the lives of their families. Career development is an integral part of the Dollar General culture, and we are focused on helping our employees reach their full potential. Approximately 70% of corporate leadership positions are filled with internal candidates, and over 10,000 of our current store managers have been internally promoted. This year, with our plan to open 900 new stores, we expect to create over 7,000 new jobs in the United States. We are confident that we will continue to retract -- attract, excuse me, and retain the right talent, and we are prioritizing investments in our people. Finally, before I open the call for questions, I want to quickly touch upon our recent progress executing against 2 of our strategic growth initiatives that we talked about last quarter. Starting with our digital initiatives. In the near term, we are strategically investing in our business to help our customers utilize digital tools and resources to create a more personalized and convenient in-store shopping experience. With nearly 75% of the U.S. population currently within 5 miles of a Dollar General, we have a unique opportunity to help shape our customers' digital shopping behavior, all while leveraging our nearly 15,000 brick-and-mortar stores to help them save time and money. Last quarter, we shared our plans to launch our new DG GO! app, which allows customers to use their phones to scan items as they shop and then skip the line by using a self-checkout. Not only does this app save our customers' time, but it also allows them to see a running total of their basket. Additionally, as they scan each item, they receive alerts to potential savings on the items they are purchasing. All of this makes staying on-budget easier. The DG GO! app went live in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store earlier this month. And the service is being piloted in 10 stores. We intend to roll it out to another 100 stores in the second quarter. As we continue to develop this app, we intend to integrate more functionality to deliver an even more personalized shopping experience. We are excited about this new technology and look forward to sharing updates with you as the year progresses. To complement these efforts, we are continuing to push forward on other digital initiatives, such as our digital coupons and personalized marketing campaigns, that will help our customers save even more time and money. We know that our customers who more frequently engage with our digital tools tend to check out with average baskets about twice as large as our chain-wide average. With more than 12 million subscriber accounts, we are excited about the foundation we have built for the future. With our unique real estate footprint and model of value and convenience, we believe we own the last mile. As such, we have an opportunity to use our understanding of our customers' digital shopping behavior to create an even better in-store experience and develop online tools that will help them save time and money. Turning to our nonconsumable initiative. In recent weeks, we began our test of a bold, new and expanded assortment in key categories. Our model enhances the treasure hunt experience by : first, offering a new differentiated and limited assortment that will change throughout the year; second, displaying the new offering in high-traffic areas with improved adjacencies and increased focus on key categories to enhance the in-store experience and create a sense of purchase urgency; and third, continue to develop exceptional value by pricing the majority of the offerings at $5 or less. While we're expanding our assortment in select categories, the amount of the space currently dedicated to nonconsumables within our stores remains the same. We plan to implement this set in approximately 700 store locations this year as we look to further complement our strong and growing consumable business. We are excited about our plans and believe we are well positioned to capture market share in a changing retail landscape. In closing, we developed a -- we delivered a solid first quarter, and we are excited about the business and the outlook for the remainder of 2018. We believe we operate in the most attractive sector in retail, and our business model is differentiated by our real estate and operating model that delivers best-in-class new store growth, steady comp growth, solid earnings and strong cash growth generation. I want to thank each of our over 130,000 employees across the company for all of their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. As a team, we are excited about our position, and we look forward to building on our progress and delivering strong performance throughout the rest of 2018. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : So has traffic flipped positive in the second quarter to date now? Traffic has been negative in the last 6, 7 quarters. So how much are you willing to accept it for you might have to step on some price investments or other initiatives in order to drive traffic positive there? Todd Vasos : Michael, we feel real good about our start to our second quarter. Once that weather headwind that we saw abated, and we got back to some normalized weather patterns at the very tail end of April, but mainly now in the month of May, we really feel good about our position. We really feel great about where we are in our pricing competitiveness in -- against all classes of trade, in all the areas that we operate in. And couple those with our initiatives to grow both traffic and our sales and baskets. I think that as we continue to move throughout the rest of this year, we'll see continued momentum in our top line, in our comp stores and in our traffic. Michael Lasser : And then my follow-up, Todd, you mentioned that the contribution from your revenue productivity should help fund tougher comparisons to the back half of the year. So can you quantify what you're expecting to contribute from your new-store ramp to be and what it has been over the last few quarters? Just can you provide us better indications of how your more mature stores are performing and as it's inevitably slowed the store growth, it might give us a sense for what the algorithms look like? John Garratt : Yes, in terms of the back half of the year, what we wanted to point out is we opened an unusually large number of stores in the second half last of year, 741 stores. I believe that's about an 80% increase over the prior year. And when you have that many stores rolling into the comp base, it delivers a considerable tailwind, which helps offset, as you'll see higher comp laps in the second half of the year. So we do see that as a tailwind. In terms of new stores and mature stores, we continue to see solid contribution from both. As we've said in the past, our new store -- our real estate contributions for both new stores, relos, remodels, net of cannibalization delivered about 150 to 200 basis points. Obviously, as you're opening new stores, it moves you towards the higher end of that range, but we continue to see comp benefit from our mature stores as well. So as we look at our comps for the year and the guidance that we provided, both in terms of where we're at, in terms of the initiatives performing well, in terms of the fundamentals of the business, coupled with this, gives us confidence in the guidance we provided. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : One, on gross margins, I mean, it sounds like shrink remains a strong opportunity. Just wondering if it's enough to keep gross margins actually up all year, or should we just expect that, that second half comparison just gets too difficult on that front. And also just wondering if you are seeing any incremental pricing or freight headwinds versus your initial guide. John Garratt : Sure, a couple of questions there, I'll try and hit all those along the way. I'll start by saying that we're very pleased with the performance in Q1, delivering 17 basis points of margin expansion despite the [indiscernible]. And we also called out that if you look at overall operating margin, it would have been level if you exclude the impact of the weather. And we really look at it that way. We really look at it -- we look at the full year operating margin rate, which we said would be, even with last year and for the full year in our guidance. And we believe that's the right way to look at it, so that we can manage all the levers within gross margin, SG&A, make the right trade-offs in the best interest of the long-term growth of the business. With that said, within gross margin specifically, we have a lot of levers within there. Shrink that you mentioned is one that we're very excited about. We delivered 6 consecutive quarters of sequential improvement with shrink. We've made investments in EAS units, as we talked about, which are performing very well, as well as other targeted investments in defensive merchandising. We had a lot of process rigor in place around this, leveraging technology, such as video-enabled exception-based reporting. So a lot of tools and process rigor to help drive shrink. But in addition to that, we have other levers within gross margin to partly offset the pressures you mentioned. We, as others, have seen pressures on fuel and freight rates, but I think the team has done a phenomenal job managing all the levers within our disposal there as we continue to see those headwinds. As we continue to open new distribution centers, we have 2 under construction now, that reduces the stem miles, we're also driving improved efficiencies around load optimization and productivity improvement throughout the supply chain. We're expanding our private fleet. We're expanding and diversifying our carrier base. So a lot of tools at play here to help offset that. In addition to that, there's other levers within gross margin. The team did a final job of category management. We see opportunity to increase our private label penetration, foreign sourcing penetration and grow our nonconsumables business. So as you look at all those, both within gross margin and the ongoing rigor around the SG&A, we feel good about the guidance that we provided for the full year. Paul Trussell : Got it. And I appreciate the commentary on cadence early on the call. But just to kind of clarify your 2Q comments, you're off to a good start, but have tougher compares sequentially. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but are you outlining that we should think about the second quarter -- has the opportunity to be better than 1Q, but the second half, just given the new stores, should be better than the first half? If you can just circle back in detail that. John Garratt : Yes, so 2 things there. One, we just wanted to point out, if you look at the cadence of the first 4 months, we started off with the solid comps in February and March, as we said, running ahead of our full-year guide for comps. Then as we got into the end of March and into April, we saw comps dip negatively. And then we saw those return strongly positive with the great to start to Q2. So we wanted to make sure people are well aware of that cadence, where we're starting up the quarter, why that gives us confident in the full-year guide. Just pointing out the lap in Q2 and the balance of the year, we just want to remind people of that. I think people were trying to figure out the cadence. I just want to remind them that while we're off to a great to start, the lap does get tougher. But as we get in the back of the year in particular, as we mentioned with all those new stores getting into the comp base, that gives us confidence that we can lap those nicely and deliver the full-year guidance. Operator : The next question is from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : First question, I just wanted to ask about the labor expenses. I just want to kind of make sure that I heard you guys properly. So one of the consistent questions we've gotten from folks since last quarter was, geez, so the full-year outlook sounds good. I think you may be able to hold to it now from what you've said in terms of the margin guidance and in terms of even margin this quarter x weather would have been flat. So is it fair to say that just from a labor perspective, kind of costs were in line with where you were thinking last quarter and that you still do feel good about that particular component of the outlook for this year? Todd Vasos : Yes, absolutely. Just as a reminder, we had one period in Q1 that we were still yet not lapped our investment in our store manager compensation and training. And so we had detailed that out. When you look past that on labor, we're seeing the benefits from our labor investments last year, and our turnover rates are well in check. And our applicant flows are as strong as ever, and a matter fact, stronger than we've seen in recent years. So right now, we feel very good about where we are in labor. But as I indicated, we continue to watch that, and we monitor it market-by-market, and we'll make adjustments if needed. But right now, we see that we're in really good shape. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. Perfect. And then just a quick follow-up. I think roughly maybe a year now into some of the smaller format tests, both the DGX and this kind of 6,000-ish foot range. Just kind of -- what have you learned over the past year? Should we still think of it as tests? And kind of what are you seeing from those smaller formats? And may be kind of thoughts as we look forward here from a store growth perspective. Todd Vasos : That's a great question. As you take a look at -- I'll address the smaller-format store first. That concept is doing very well for us. We're using that concept in deeper urban areas as well as very rural areas that are perhaps more crossroads than they are cities or towns. We continue to open those and we continue to be very pleased with the results of those. On the DGX front, we've got 3 stores that are up and running. We're looking for 2 more sites for this year. So we should have 5 by the end of the year. I would consider that still more in the test phase, as we continue to play with the mix a little bit to see who what resonates and what doesn't with the consumer. But I have to tell you, of the 3 stores, we're very happy with what we see so far. And it could be a nice unlock for our deep urban-type areas across many of our metro U.S. cities that we have out there. Operator : Your next question is for Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Todd, any change in the larger-picture view that you have with the low-income consumer? I know you talked about the tailwinds versus the headwinds, and I think more recently you've talked about tailwinds exceeding headwinds. I guess, just maybe help us to think about where you see that today and going forward? Todd Vasos : Yes. Matthew, as you know, we really are probably some of the best out of there at knowing our core customer and really looking at her each and every quarter. And I can tell you that still today, I would tell you that her economic outlook is more of a tailwind than it is a headwind. But there are those expenses that continue to rise for our core consumer. We continue to watch fuel rates. But right now, that isn't too much of a headwind for her, but we continue to watch that. But rents and health care are the 2 big ones. Especially rents in rural areas, there's not an abundance of homes and housing there, and rents have escalated at a pretty good clip in the rural area. So we continue to watch that because that becomes a headwind, obviously, for our core consumer. But right now, she's back to work, wages are up a little, her confidence levels are up a little. So all that is really positive and gives us confidence in our full-year outlook on the top line. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow-up. I guess, how would you measure the competitive backdrop today versus years past? Help us to think about markdowns, which I know have been headwinds. It has been something you haven't spoken to in the last couple of quarters. And then, John, maybe just multi-year, any update on foreign sourcing and some of the initiatives to stabilize mix from the gross margin side? Todd Vasos : Right now, as you look at the competitive landscape, as you know, this channel, as well as just consumable retailing, it's always very competitive out there. But I have to tell you that we are looking at this as we have in the last couple quarters, is that we believe it's well in check, the competitive nature of what's out there. We are competitively priced, everyday low across the board. And as we continue to become more and more confident in where that consumer is, we continue to pull back a little bit on that markdown. And that's why you haven't heard too much about that. And that continues to be a nice tailwind for us as well. But as we continue to look forward, we always reserve the right, though, to make sure that we stay very competitive in price. So we watch price very closely across all channels of trade. Operator : Your next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So first on the food inflation backdrop. Just curious in terms of what type of impact you had during the quarter and your expectations for the balance of the year. John Garratt : Yes, I'll just summarize that by saying, we're not seeing a material impact one way or the other from food inflation right now. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. And then as we look at the traffic decline during the quarter, do you attribute that primarily to weather or other factors at play? Todd Vasos : So as you take a look at, again, the cadence of sales in the quarter, I think it's fair to say, traffic followed very closely that same cadence. So predominantly, it definitely was a weather phenomenon. Operator : Your next question is from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Marisa Sullivan : So this is actually Marissa Sullivan on for Robbie. I wanted to touch on some of the produce tests that you're doing in some of your stores that's beyond just the DG marketplace. How many stores is it in right now? What are you seeing? And what are your thoughts in terms of expanding produce to more of the store base? Todd Vasos : Yes, today, we have over 200 stores outside of the market store piece for the produce. As we indicated, we put 45 more stores in this past first quarter. We feel good about where we are. We've got a lot of track record because of our market stores for many years on how to treat produce within our stores. But we're still learning in our smaller store formats. But we see it as a competitive advantage, especially in rural areas where there isn't a lot of competition and/or food choices, especially healthy food choices, for our core consumers. So we see it as a real opportunity and an advantage to deliver something to our core consumer that they're looking for. And unfortunately, today, in many of the markets having to drive 15, 20 miles to get it. So we'll continue to learn and grow with that. I would tell you, it's not going to be for every store, somewhere down the line. But could it be for thousands eventually? Yes, it could. Marisa Sullivan : Got it. And just as a follow up on your comments around some of your treasure hunt initiatives. I know you gave us the annual target. How many stores do you have that initiative in right now? And can you give us any early commentary on what you're seeing in terms of lifts and penetration in the discretionary categories in those stores? Todd Vasos : Yes. It's in the very early stages, as you can imagine. We have a handful up and running. Again, we've got a very aggressive plan to do 700 of them by the end of the year. We feel very good about executing against that. It's probably a little early to talk about what we're seeing. I can tell you, though, that in the early results, they are on the positive side. But again, keep in mind, very early. So stay tuned. We'll give you more color as that becomes more crystallized for us. And we believe, though, it should be a real win for us in the long term because what our consumers tell us is, in nonconsumable arena, they're looking for more of a treasure hunt experience than an everyday consumable shop for nonconsumables. So I think that we're on the right track, but time will tell. Operator : Your next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : Todd, let me start with -- you talked about the ROI of the store manager effort. So what metrics have you seen improve, say, over the last year since you've done that? One of the things that it does tend to improve, I think, is shrink. Have you seen that correlate with shrink as well? Todd Vasos : So we're very pleased. We're actually well exceeded the ROI in year 1, well exceeded it. The culprits, if you will, the ones you would think you would get benefit from there, we're getting benefit. So that top line, I believe we're getting benefits there. We're definitely getting benefit from turnover. We're at historic lows on our store manager turnover. And as you know, John, being the student of this business for a long time, a good, strong, stable store manager, then that translates -- and we're seeing this -- into less turnover in the assistant manager ranks and even less turnover in our hourly ranks. And we're seeing that for the very first time in so many years. So we know it's directly attributable to our efforts there. You couple that with that training that we did last year and developing our people and encouraging them to move ahead with this company, it's all been a win. So we feel very good about that investment. And we believe this has a multi-year link to it, and we should to see benefits as we move throughout '18 and even into early '19. John Heinbockel : And then maybe just as a follow-up. When you think about the discretionary business, right, so it has been negative for a while, turned positive in the second half of last year, negative in the first quarter. Is it solely weather? And do you think discretionary? In total, those 3 categories, they will be positive for '18? Todd Vasos : As you look at our nonconsumable business, it's very important to us. Our teams work hard at ensuring that they have the right items at the right price for our consumers. You couple all of our efforts in category management there over the years, I would tell you, as you look at Q1, we are pretty pleased with where nonconsumables are tracking until we hit that weather time that we talked about. So we're pretty bullish as we move now into Q2. I can tell you that, again, we've talked about the comps have accelerated. And leading the way in comps right now are some of these seasonal and nonconsumable categories. And you would think that would be true because we're making up some of that ground. You never make up all of it, but you're making up some of that ground coming from the loss of Q1. In the long-term, though, we believe that nonconsumables is one of our biggest opportunities, and that's the reason why our nonconsumable initiative, the 700 stores, we're going to put in the ground this year with that, it's going to be so important as we continue to move forward. We believe that we may have the right formula here to really start to move our nonconsumable sales forward. Operator : Your next question is from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : Todd, you noted on the Plus formats, it's a pretty impressive comp lift, the 10% to 15%,. There does seem to be a step-up in the remodel activity, that format. Is that something that you think is a new initiative that can carry forward for a couple of years at this, call it, 400 DG Plus format remodels? Todd Vasos : Yes. We, as you know, we have a very intricate real estate model, which includes looking at all of our mature store bases and touching those every 7 to 10 years on a remodel basis. So the answer to your question, we believe the DGTP remodel has a lot of legs to it still left. We, again, don't believe every remodel will be underneath that. But again, could there be thousands of those somewhere down the road? Absolutely, can be. And the same with the produce piece, as I mentioned. I believe that you can see that in thousands of stores as we go into the future. But we're very, very pleased with that DGTP format because it leverages our current box, but just makes it that much more productive. And those 10% to 15% comp lifts on a remodel are very, very impressive. Peter Keith : Okay. And then lastly for me, I don't think it was ever quantified. But would you be able to give us what your estimation of the weather impact on Q1 is? And then what amount of that you would expect to recapture in Q2? John Garratt : Yes, we didn't quantify that. But I think it's instructive, again, when you look at the cadence of the quarter in terms of how comps were ahead of the full-year guidance prior to April, when the weather impact was, and we're off to a great start for this quarter. And as you look at the categories, it was -- the weather-sensitive categories impacted, the spring and summer and other weather-sensitive categories. And if you look at the consumables side, which isn't as  impacted by that, we had very solid strong comps in the consumables category. So I think it's instructive to look at it that way, as well as, as we've indicated, from an expense standpoint, if not for the impact of the weather, we would have been even year-over-year in terms of operating margin when you factor in the impact it had, not only on the sales, but weather-related expenses. Peter Keith : Okay, great. And just is there a recapture dynamic? And if not, is there markdown risks to Q2? Todd Vasos : No. At this point, we feel very confident in our sell-through rates, especially as now we moved into the month of May, we've seen that acceleration. We don't see anything on the horizon that worries us at this point. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does concludes the portion of today's Q&A. We thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Jennifer, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are very pleased with our strong second quarter results, which were driven by robust performance on both the top line and bottom line. A key highlight of the quarter was our 3.7% same-store sales growth. Both basket and traffic growth drove these results, demonstrating what we have long believed to be true : by providing the products, convenience and value that our customers want, we can continue profitably growing sales. I also want to note that our second -- that our 2-year same-store sales stack for the second quarter of 2018 was the highest in 10 quarters. Year-to-date through the second quarter of 2018, we posted 2.9% same-store sales growth driven by greater customer productivity. Based on our performance in the first half and our outlook for the rest of the year, we are increasing our net sales and same-store sales guidance for 2018. We are executing against our operating priorities and believe we are well positioned to deliver solid growth in the second half of 2018. Now let's recap some of the top line results for the second quarter. Net sales increased by 10.6% to $6.4 billion compared to net sales of $5.8 billion in the second quarter of 2017. We're very pleased with the new store productivity and performance from our mature stores. Our 3.7% same-store sales increase was led by our strong performance in consumables. We're proud of this performance and believe we are well positioned against all classes of trade as evidenced by our market share gains in the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week period ended July 28, 2018. These gains are measured by syndicated data.  Within nonconsumables, we also delivered solid overall positive comp growth driven primarily by strong sales in our seasonal category. As we have discussed in recent quarters, overall, we continue to see rational pricing activity across the industry. We know it's always competitive within the discount retail space, but we are committed to being price right for our customer every day.  As we continue to execute against our operating priorities, we believe we have opportunities to capture incremental market share. We will continue to work to drive awareness of the value proposition that we offer. After John's comments, I'll provide an update on our growth initiatives.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to John to provide you with more detail on our second quarter financial results. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has discussed a few highlights in the second quarter, I will take you through some of the important financial details. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year.  As Todd has already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.6% in the second quarter, a decrease of 7 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to the ongoing product category mix shift to consumables as well as higher sales of lower margin consumable products and higher markdowns. Like many other retailers, our business continues to see the effect of increasing transportation costs due to the tight carrier market and higher fuel prices, among other factors. This impact is reflected in the slightly lower gross margin we reported in the second quarter. These factors were partially offset by another quarter of improved inventory shrink as well as positive contributions from initial inventory markup.  SG&A expense as a percent of sales was 22.2%, a decrease of 8 basis points. The leverage in the second quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by : lower repairs and maintenance expenses; a reduction in lease termination expenses as we lap the acquisition of the Dollar Express stores in the second quarter of 2017; lower fixed asset impairment costs; and a reduction in retail labor expenses as a percentage of sales. Partially offsetting those decreases were an increase in professional fees, primarily to support a variety of longer-term initiatives; higher incentive compensation expenses; and increased costs to support certain loss prevention initiatives. We are pleased with the leverage we gained in SG&A and our ability to hold operating margin relatively flat this quarter. And we would note that we achieved this margin despite the transportation headwinds we are facing and while continuing to invest in our current business model and opportunities for long-term growth.  Moving down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%. This compares to 37.2% in the second quarter of 2017. This decrease is primarily attributable to the lower federal tax rate in the 2018 period as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Finally, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.52. We are heading into the back half of the year with a strong balance sheet and expect to continue our track record of generating strong cash flow from operations.  Merchandise inventories were $3.9 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2018, up 12.5% and up 3.9% on a per store basis. We believe our inventory remains in great shape, and we remain focused over the long term on managing inventory growth to be in line with or below our sales growth.  Throughout the first half of 2018, we generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $1.1 billion, an increase of $311 million or 39.6%. Year-to-date total capital expenditures were $371 million and included : our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations; continued investments in our 2 distribution centers under construction; and spending related to the previously announced acceleration of certain key initiatives.  During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock for $200 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $77 million. Through the end of the second quarter, we returned a total of $504 million in 2008 (sic) [ 2018 ] to our shareholders through our share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments. From the inception of our share repurchase program in December 2011 through the second quarter of 2018, we have repurchased $5.5 billion or 85 million shares of our common stock. At the end of the second quarter, the remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $1 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged as we continue to be disciplined and focused on financial returns. Our first priority is investing in high return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR.  We are pleased with our position midway through the year, and we are excited about the momentum in the business. Based upon our year-to-date performance, we are raising the outlook we provided on May 31, 2018, for both net sales and same-store sales. For fiscal 2018, we now expect net sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 9.3% and our same-store sales growth to be in the mid- to high 2% range. We continue to expect our fiscal year 2018 operating margin rate to be relatively flat as compared to our fiscal year 2017 operating margin rate. We are reiterating our outlook for diluted EPS for the full year, which is $5.95 to $6.15. As a reminder, our earnings outlook included the impact of increasing transportation costs, some continued mix pressures and continued investment in our longer-term growth initiatives. Our diluted EPS guidance assumes our tax rate will be at the lower end of our 22% to 23% range that we provided. Our outlook for fiscal 2013 real estate projects, CapEx and share repurchases remains unchanged.  For modeling purposes, I do want to take a moment and update you on some of the puts-and-takes in the back half of the year. First, as we noted last quarter, in the second half of 2017, we opened 741 new stores driven by the acquisition of the Dollar Express location, which is a much higher number than our typical cadence. As a result, in the second half of 2018, we'll have an unusually high number of stores rolling into the comp base. The anticipated positive impact of these stores should help with the tougher comparisons we face as we move through the latter part of the fiscal year. This expected positive impact is contemplated in our full year guidance.  Second, while we expect to see pressures mentioned on gross margins continue in the second half of the year, we are executing strategies that we believe can help mitigate the impact of these headwinds over time. Despite the headwinds from transportation and our product sales mix, we are on track to deliver a relatively flat operating margin rate for the full year as we manage all the levers within gross margin and SG&A. We feel good about our position today because of the actions we are taking to help mitigate headwinds and maximize our sales growth opportunities.  Turning to operating expense. In the second quarter, we spent approximately $8 million to advance our strategic initiatives. Our strong sales growth allowed us to invest in our future and deliver on the bottom line. We expect to continue investing in these important initiatives that we believe will extend our runway for growth.  Finally, a reminder on interest expense. Your model should include the impact of the bond refinancing we completed in the first quarter. We estimate the net impact of 2018 financing activities to be about $9 million in annualized interest expense going forward. As always, we are focused on carefully controlling costs even as we make targeted proactive investments. We continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistently strong financial performance, while positioning our business for long-term growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ability to drive profitable same-store sales growth, drive healthy new store returns, generate strong cash flow from operations and create long-term shareholder value.  With that, I will now turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. For the remainder of my remarks, I want to walk through how we are executing against our 4 operating priorities, which has served us well and placed us in a leadership position within our channel. I'll also update you on the progress against certain strategic growth initiatives.  Starting with our first priority of driving profitable sales growth. Our most impactful top line initiatives for 2018 revolve around merchandising and store operations. These initiatives are designed to enhance the value and convenient proposition for our customers, offering them the trusted simple solutions they seek from us every day. We continue to strategically invest in our mature store base. As you know, one of our strategies is to increase the average number of cooler doors across the chain. These types of projects drive high returns by encouraging our customers to make more trips and increase their basket sizes. This year, our goal is to install more than 20,000 incremental cooler doors across our mature store base. As of the end of the quarter, we have installed approximately 16,000 cooler doors across the chain, and we are well on our way to reaching our year-end goal. By the end of the fiscal year, we expect to have an average of 20 cooler doors per store, up from 10 in 2012.  During the second quarter, we continued to focus on driving impulse purchases. One of the ways we do this is through our enhanced queue lines. During the second quarter, we added the enhanced queue line to more than 400 existing stores, bringing our total for the chain to approximately 6,800 stores. The queue line retrofit performance remains very strong. We expect to have this enhancement in more than 7,500 stores by the end of 2018.  In June, we launched Phase 2 of our health and beauty initiative, which is in approximately 7,500 stores today. The goal of this phase is to educate our customers about the high-quality products we carry, both national and private brands, as well as our low prices. We are a well-known leader in value and convenience, but we believe many of our customers are unaware of the value we offer within health and beauty. We are confident that we have the opportunity to take market share from other channels among existing and potential customers. While it's still early, we are encouraged by the favorable response to this initiative, thus far.  We are also very excited about the early results from our Better For You initiative. We launched Better For You just a few months ago, and already, the value proposition is resonating with our customers who are looking for healthier options at affordable prices. Currently, we have more than 2,000 stores that are carrying, on average, 125 Better For You products. Within this offering, we have now launched more than 40 items under the Good & Smart private brand with more in the works. This brand offers our customers a variety of Better For You options at smart prices, and we are excited to bring -- to begin building brand equity and customer loyalty for this product line.  In addition to these initiatives, I have seen the fall season and Christmas lineups, and we're excited about the upcoming seasons and new products, which we believe will resonate with our customers.  In addition to these merchandising efforts, our store operations teams are also executing on multiple fronts with a focus on driving sales. First, we continue to reach new heights in overall customer satisfaction. For us, this means concentrating on store cleanliness, on-shelf availability, friendliness and speed of checkout. By hitting our goals, we believe we can drive higher overall satisfaction and cultivate even more loyalty with our customers.  Also within store operations, we continue to focus on driving inventory shrink down even further. Reducing shrink remains our largest near-term gross margin opportunity. We're very excited about our progress, and we saw our seventh consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in the shrink rate. Our improvements in the shrink rate have been supported by a variety of actions, including defensive merchandising tactics, leveraging technology and new store process controls and expanding Electronic Article Surveillance or EAS. This year, we have doubled the stores using EAS technology to about 10,000.  One thing I want to highlight is that while we have continued to reduce shrink, we have also continued to improve on-shelf availability. As students of retail, you will know how difficult it is to achieve both of these goals at the same time. I am proud to say the team has delivered, as shrink and on-shelf availability both have continued to improve. We also have other longer-term gross margin opportunities. These include many distribution and transportation initiatives such as reducing stem miles, improving our load optimization, growing and diversifying our carrier base and expanding our private fleet. With regard to our private fleet, we remain on track to expand from 80 tractors at the end of fiscal 2017 to approximately 200 tractors by the end of this year. While this represents a relatively small percent of our current transportation base, we believe that, over time, this will give us added flexibility and health insulators from future carrier rate fluctuations.  We continue to make strides growing our distribution network as well. The team has done a fantastic job driving this expansion and creating opportunities to further improve our efficiencies. Our distribution centers currently under construction in Longview, Texas and Amsterdam, New York are both scheduled to begin shipping in the 2019 calendar year. We continue to anticipate that we will see a relatively quick and positive impact on stem miles. As always, we are continually evaluating opportunities to drive efficiencies and productivity within our distribution center network to support profitable sales growth.  I also want to note that not only is the team doing a great job finding quality sites for distribution centers, but they are quickly ramping up by hitting productivity goals. For example, our Janesville, Wisconsin distribution center is our second newest DC and is currently the most productive in the chain.  We also have opportunities to drive gross margin with our global sourcing strategy, category management and private brands. While we're excited about these opportunities to enhance our gross margin over the long term, we are also carefully watching the potential for new headwinds to develop, particularly around tariffs. Our merchants and global sourcing teams have been working closely with our vendor partners to identify opportunities to mitigate the impact of current and potential tariffs on both our businesses and our customers' budgets. We have long-standing relationships with many of our vendors, and we will continue to work closely with them to find ways to reduce cost. We are keeping a close eye on the situation, and we will be looking at all opportunities. As a reminder, our retail operations are solely domestic, and we purchase in U.S. dollars.  In addition to the tariff impact, we closely watch macroeconomic indicators that may affect our customers. While the overall economy seems to be doing well, we know that rising fuel prices, concerns about health care and potential loss or reduction of government benefits may weigh on our core customers' outlook. As always, we remain committed to serving our customers with the everyday low prices they have come to know and appreciate from Dollar General.  On our -- our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. We have a proven high-return, low-risk model for real estate and a track record of successfully opening hundreds of stores every year that meet our strict return thresholds. These new store openings, combined with our successful remodels and relocations, have allowed us to extend our runway for long-term growth. We are always looking for opportunities to grow the number of communities we serve using the lessons we've learned in other markets and from the performance of our various formats. As a reminder, our real estate model focuses on 5 metrics to ensure that new store growth is the best use of our capital : first, new store productivity as a percent of our comp store sales, which continues to average in the range of 80% to 85%; second, in actual sales performance, which continues to track very closely to our pro forma model; third, average returns, which remain at the high end of our targeted 20% to 22% range; fourth, cannibalization of our new stores on our comp store base, which has remained relatively constant in our measurements; and finally, new stores have a payback period of 2 years or less. We have consistently hit our overall goals for these metrics. We are very pleased with our overall new store returns, and we remain committed to investing our capital effectively to drive strong financial returns. This year, we plan to open 900 new stores, remodel 1,000 of our mature stores and relocate approximately 100 stores. We are excited to be on track to achieve these goals by the end of the year. During the second quarter, we opened 241 stores, remodeled 322 stories and relocated 31 stores. Of our 322 remodeled stores, 121 were remodeled in the Dollar General Traditional Plus format, or DGTP, which is the traditional size store with expanded cooler count. We included a fresh produce section in 31 of these DGTP remodels. As a reminder, our remodel store delivers 4% to 5% comp lift on average, and a DGTP remodel delivers an average of 10% to 15% comp lift. And when produce is included in a DGTP, it delivers comp, on average, at the high end of the 10% to 15% range. We currently have more than 400 stores throughout the chain, which now carry produce.  This quarter, I had the opportunity to attend the 15,000th store grand opening celebration in Wilmington, North Carolina. It is truly remarkable and reflects on 15,000 Dollar General stores serving communities around the country. This milestone is a credit to the tremendous work of the team, and I remain very excited about the growth opportunities ahead of us.  Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to manage spending. We continue to refine our process and have developed a culture where we are intentional about examining all of our costs and expenses. All of our spending is filtered through 3 criteria : first, is it customer-facing; second, does it align with our strategic priorities; and third, how does it impact our risk profile? At the store level, our operational initiatives for 2018 are centered on space optimization and efforts to further simplify our operations by reducing unproductive inventory, operating complexity and product movement within the stores. These actions are designed to control cost and allow our store managers and their teams to provide better customer service as well as a fast, clean and in-stock shopping experience. All of these actions correlate to higher sales. We will continue to focus on our underlying principles to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, control expenses and always seek to be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are our competitive advantage. Our investments in wages and training are well documented, and the returns on these investments continue to exceed our goals. For example, in addition to our strong sales growth, store manager turnover is continuing to improve, and we remain committed to further developing this talent pipeline. We are excited about these investments, and we believe they can continue to pay benefits over the long term. I had the privilege earlier this month of spending a week with more than 1,500 leaders of the company at our annual leadership meeting. I'm always impressed by their passion and commitment on display and reminded of the strength of Dollar General's culture. During that week, our teams from around the country had the opportunity to engage and learn from each other as well as to work through various training opportunities under one roof. Our goal is to provide our employees with training opportunities that enhance their career growth and drive improved customer service. We believe that the opportunity to build a long-term career at Dollar General is the most important currency we have to attract and retain talent. We believe the career opportunities, our competitive wages and the engaging environment we offer will allow us to remain an employer of choice and keep us well positioned to attract and retain talent.  Finally, before I open the call up for questions, I want to quickly update you on our recent progress executing against our digital and nonconsumable strategies of growth -- of our long-term growth opportunities. Starting with our digital initiatives, in the near term, our digital strategy focuses on using technology to improve the in-store experience by offering customers even more personalization and convenience. In 2018, we are bringing this focus to light with our DG GO! app, which is now live in more than 100 stores. Our goal is to roll out this functionality to an additional 150 stores by the end of the year with a goal to further expand in 2019. As a reminder, the app allows customers to use their phones to scan items as they shop, and then skip the register by using the DG GO! kiosk. Our app also alerts customers to potential savings on the items they are purchasing. So far, the feedback on this app has been very positive. We intend to continue integrating even more helpful functionality that delivers on the promise of personalized and convenient shopping experience. We know that our customers who more frequently engage with our digital tools tend to shop with us more often and check out with larger basket sizes. We currently have 14 million subscriber accounts within our Digital Coupon program. These subscribers have put more than 400 million digital coupons year-to-date in 2018.  Deploying innovative technology across our stores remains an incredible opportunity for us, and we are investing appropriately. In fact, this quarter, we created a new Chief Technology Officer role to help drive our digital efforts. We look forward to sharing further updates with you as the year progresses. Turning to our nonconsumable initiative. In the second quarter, we began our test of a bold, new and expanded assortment in key nonconsumable classes of home, domestic, housewares, and party and occasions. This initiative is focused on : first, offering a new, differentiated and limited assortment that will change throughout the year; second, displaying the new offering in high-traffic areas will improve adjacencies and increase focus on key class -- classes to enhance the in-store experience and create a sense of purchase urgency; and third, continue to deliver exceptional value by pricing the majority of the offerings at $5 or less. While the amount of space in the store dedicated to nonconsumables remains the same, we believe this merchandising strategy will drive greater sell-through. We have added this assortment to more than 300 stores and plan to have approximately 700 total stores up and running by the end of the fiscal year. This is still in the early stages, but we're encouraged by the results in the test stores so far. We believe that over time, this initiative can help meaningfully improve the trend on nonconsumable sales growth, drive traffic to the store and positively impact gross margin.  In closing, we delivered a strong second quarter and we are proud of our results. We are excited about the business and believe we operate in the most attractive sector in retail. We have a differentiated business model that leverages our real estate acumen and our low-cost operating experience with our clear focus on delivering value and convenience to our customers. The economy is doing well. Our customers seem to have a little bit more money in their pocket, and this is contributing to our strong results. Remember though, our customers are always under pressure and looking to stretch their budget. As we have always said, our results illustrate that our model works in good times and in challenging times as evidenced by 28 consecutive years of same-store sales growth. We believe Dollar General's business is well positioned to continue to succeed over the long term in a variety of economic conditions. I want to thank each of our approximately 134,000 employees across the company for all their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. The entire team is excited about our position and our outlook, and we look forward to building on our progress and driving solid performance throughout the rest of 2018.  With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Matthew Boss : So I guess, first question, John. On gross margins in the back half, is it best to model a back-half gross margin performance pretty similar to the slight contraction that we saw in the second quarter? I guess, just any help on the drivers of gross margin for the back half of the year maybe versus the second quarter, anything to consider would be helpful. John Garratt : Well, I'll start by saying that we're very pleased with the first half performance, and as you look at the balance we struck with strong top line growth and gross profit expansion, we really focus on overall operating margin as we can manage all the levers within there. And so we've guided folks toward that and said that over the course of the year, we see ourselves in a position to deliver relatively flat operating margin rate year-over-year. There's a lot of puts and takes within there. One of the things we mentioned was increased near-term pressure from carrier rates, which could get a little bit worse before it gets better as well as while we saw it lesson some in the quarter, we do have ongoing mix pressures. But we have a lot of levers within gross margin to help counteract that. We were delighted with the performance of shrink, 7 quarters of sequential improvement there. And with the investments we've made, we see opportunity to continue driving improvement there. The team continues to do a fabulous job with category management. We see a lot of opportunity there. We were pleased with the growth in nonconsumables this quarter, continue to see opportunity around private label and foreign sourcing. And while there are headwinds on supply chain efficiencies, the team's doing a great job mitigating that and helping offset some of that with stem mile reductions. We opened up more DCs. There's 2 under construction right now. They continue to drive efficiencies around load optimization, DC productivity, private fleet expansion. And then we continue to expand and diversify our carrier base to help mitigate those headwinds. So when you put it all together, we feel really good about our ability that we've done thus far and through the year to mitigate those headwinds to deliver relatively flat operating margin rate for the year while importantly investing in high-return, strategic initiatives that we think are going to drive the future growth of this business. Matthew Boss : Great. And then, Todd, just a follow-up. On same-store sales, nice to see the return to positive traffic this quarter. I guess, what do you think drove the improvement? Do you see positive traffic as sustainable? And maybe just touch on some of the performance that you're seeing from your more mature stores. Todd Vasos : Yes, my hat is off to the -- our merchants and our operators. They have done a fabulous job over the years to set us up for success. And I think you saw that start to come together once again here in the second quarter. When we look at our overall sales performance, we're very encouraged on our -- on all of our initiatives that we have in play, our cooler initiatives, our health and beauty initiatives as well as our new Better For You initiative that we've now got in thousands of stores across the country and more to come. And then when you start to then look at even upcoming initiatives that are in the pipeline, we feel that sustaining positive traffic is exactly what we plan to continue to work toward for the back half of the year. That is always the goal. We know that traffic is key to long-term sustainability of comps, and that's where the team is really focused. Operator : Your next question is from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Wanted to ask -- we've gotten a question just from a couple of folks today. Very strong sales, of course, this quarter. We've gotten the question though, like, EPS, kind of maintained from a bottom line perspective. So I guess, just how would you respond to that? Is it more of, hey, we feel good, it's a decently wide range. There's the -- kind of the freight, the mix, some of the initiatives that you guys called out as headwinds and it's only at 2Q. Just wondering how you would respond to that question. John Garratt : Yes, I think a lot of the things you say is the right way to think about that. I want to echo that we're very pleased with the Q2 results with 41% EPS growth, double-digit operating profit growth. We feel we're in a great spot. We feel that range, $5.95 to $6.15, is the right range. It's narrower than it used to be as we bought back shares and have a lower tax rate. But there's a lot of puts and takes within there, and we do see some increased headwinds associated with transportation costs. And again, the mix, while moderating, continues to be a bit of a pressure. And the other thing we mentioned is we want to make sure that we're reinvesting in the business, making targeted investments in strategic initiatives that's going to drive high returns. And we think this is the appropriate range based on all that. I think that's the right tradeoff for the business. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. All right, cool. And then if I could, maybe just going back to when you guys gave the initial outlook for this year. One of, again, just investor questions that we had gotten was, with kind of normal course labor investments, given that you guys had gotten ahead of it several quarters before last year, is that something that's going to be able to kind of stick to the plan? So I guess, in light of this last quarter, with a lot of other retailers kind of stepping that spend up, have you seen any changes? Do you still feel good about kind of in line with your plan and where you are for the rest of this year on labor? That'd be great. Todd Vasos : Sure. Vinnie, like many things, we got ahead of this and made sure that we did what was right for our business and, of course, our people last year as we invested over $70 million, as you recall, in both wages and training. That gift is still continuing to give, if you will, in that we're seeing that our turnover rates are lower than last year even after we put this into effect. It's been in effect now for well over a year. And we're also seeing better sales, better shrink results. And I want to also mention that on a percent basis, we have seen the lowest level in recorded history that we can find on a percent basis of open store manager positions across our company. And that really goes to show you that the investments we made are doing well and are sticking very, very well. And then when you couple that with our aggressive pay and our hourly wage that we've always stayed true to and made sure we paid very competitive wages against, we're seeing that applicant flow is the highest that we've seen. And so as you start to see that, the pipeline is full and we have less open positions even at the hourly rate in our stores than we had last year. So all that really goes to show us that we made the right decision on wages, and we continue to make the right decisions as we move forward. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Congrats on a very solid comp performance in 2Q. Just also following up on the guidance comment. I know you don't give specifics on a quarterly basis, but could you just help us think about some of the puts and takes in 3Q versus 4Q on overall revenues, comps and margins? Just given the more challenging comparisons, the cycling of the hurricanes, the timing of the Express store openings, just what should we keep in mind as we model? John Garratt : Yes, so a couple of things there. We -- in Q3, we do lap the impact of the hurricane, which is obviously reflected in our guidance and I think most people have modeled that in. And in Q4, we do lap the closure of stores last year. But I think the other thing we've mentioned, as you look at the back half of the year, one thing that gives us confidence in the sales number we've put out there is not only the initiatives, the traction we're seeing in the initiatives and the performance of the mature stores as well as the existing stores, but also, one of things we mentioned as you get into the back half of the year, while the laps get more difficult, the benefit of the Dollar Express stores roll into that comp base. As we opened an unusually large number stores in the second half of last year, that rolls into the comp base and we see the performance of those, that will help your comp and offset those tougher laps. And I think the other thing we mentioned is just with transportation costs. That's a bit of a wild card and who knows where fuel rates will go, but we are seeing, in addition to that, just a tightening, further tightening of the carrier base, which could make things a little bit worse before they get better around transportation costs. So that's a headwind we wanted to point out in the second half. And then the other thing we just talked about is the investments. While we're making very targeted investments, we do want to make sure we're investing in what we see as very high return prospects for the business, the strategic initiatives, other initiatives. And I think if we can -- when we deliver the EPS range that we've guided to here, we believe we can. And while we're investing in the business, we think that's a fantastic EPS growth and operating profit growth for the year while investing in the future. So we feel really good about our ability to mitigate the headwinds, invest in the business and deliver a great year. Paul Trussell : That's helpful. And then just to follow up, if you could just speak to the performance of the new stores and how you're thinking about the waterfall as stores mature. And then separately, just the apparel performance. I know you're working on some initiatives there. But that was still lacking, I guess, apparel and home in the first half relative to how well you're performing in consumables. Just how should we think about the timetable of getting the return on those strategic investments? John Garratt : I'll take the first question with regard to new unit performance. We continue to see great results out of our new units. As we've mentioned in the past, we manage -- we measure a basket of metrics, including new store productivity, where we continue to see our new stores opening at 80% to 85% productivity range of mature stores. We continue to see the actual sales track very closely to our pro forma model expectations. The team does a phenomenal job picking great sites and projecting the sales of those and they continue to deliver. We continue to see returns at the high end of our 20% to 22% range. And again, bear in mind, that's after tax and includes the impact of cannibalization, which we also track closely and continue to see that to be as expected and consistent. And we continue to see a payback period of less than 2 years. So we're very pleased with the performance we continue to see in those new stores. In terms of their contribution to comp, what we've said in the past is the impact of new stores, reloads, remodels and now cannibalization is in that 150 to 200 range, we continue to see that and with a great performance lately actually at the higher end of that. Todd Vasos : And Paul, when you take a look at the sales initiatives, as we had mentioned, a lot of them are in and around consumables, but there are quite a few around nonconsumables as well. And as you take a look at our longer-term strategic initiatives around nonconsumables, we're very pleased with our early results there. We've got over 300 stores now that we've remodeled with the new nonconsumable look and feel, and they are doing very, very well. So it gives us great confidence that the 700 that we've got planned into this year that they'll have the same results as we continue to move forward. Now, these are longer-term initiatives. So as we move into 2019, with this confidence that we're seeing in the sales, we'll be able to put that into more stores and stay tuned into 2019 on how many we do. But at this rate, we believe we could do quite a lot of them in 2019 to help continue to move the needle in our nonconsumables. But even past that, in all of our stores, I think our team has done a fabulous job in being very relevant on our nonconsumable offering and also continue to show the value. And I think that showed, especially in our seasonal categories, in 2000 -- I'm sorry, in Q2 here that we just ended, where we had a very strong positive comp in seasonal, which drew a positive comp for the entire nonconsumable category as whole. So we feel good about the back half in nonconsumables and we'll continue to push hard to balance that mix out. Operator : Your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So it looks like home and apparel -- the home and apparel category just still kind of comping negative. Todd, with the retail environment that we have today, I guess, I would think that you'd have a bit more top line momentum in these discretionary categories. And obviously, it sounds like you're making some merchandise changes as you previously described. But do you have a view as to why even in this environment, it seemed to be such a struggle to drive positive comps in these categories? Todd Vasos : Yes, I think as you continue to take a look at nonconsumables, a few things that we have done, we are making changes, to your point, in our current lineup. And one of the changes we started to make even last year was a reduction in our apparel offering. And that was very intentional to give more room for some consumable areas but also some other nonconsumable areas as like, for instance, in some seasonal categories, which you saw pretty good strength in. So there is a trade-off there, we knew that going in. But when you look in totality, you always have to remember, too, while the economy is doing very well, our core customer continues to struggle because normally, her expenses outstrip her wage growth. And that's what we're really seeing here is that when you -- when you take a look at our core customer, the headwinds of rents as well as health care increases, that they are real for our core customer. And she continues to buy a little bit more because she does have just a small amount of income more, but not a lot. And we continue to offer her great values, both in consumables and nonconsumables. And we're seeing the effects in many, many areas where she is buying more, but a lot of it is to benefit her family and to feed her family. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : If you look at the performance of your store base in this most recent quarter, were there themes or trends that you saw, whether it was from a geographic perspective, urban, rural, suburban, or from a competitive overlap perspective? And the question really is to get at are you seeing some evidence that those discretionary -- incremental discretionary dollars that most consumers have at this point are flowing into some of your competitors and there may be a bit of a procyclical trade up, and you may not feeling as much of a benefit from that? Todd Vasos : Yes. Let me start by saying that we are very pleased with our sales overall. That 3.7% comp was very strong. And we saw benefit from all across the country, every division across the country benefited in that. So that was great to see. That really shows that not only the consumer has a little bit more money, but also, our initiatives in totality are really paying off. Again, 3.7% comp is pretty strong. And then, as you look at our customer segmentation, and that's the second part of your question, what we're seeing is that while our core customer, which we call our best friends forever, or BFFs, they continue to stay very solid and are very good loyal customers of ours. The interesting thing here we're seeing is that some of our largest, on a percent basis, growth in customers is coming from higher income, which is very interesting. So even though the economy's doing better, what it really shows us is that all the work that we've done with the offering inside of our box over the years is even more relevant than ever and is even more relevant to a higher end consumer. Even in a good economy, she is still looking for value and convenience and she's finding it at Dollar General. So that's great to see, and we have seen no sign of trade out or trade up from our core customers. So that all adds up to that strong 3.7% comp. Michael Lasser : And the higher income consumer, are they coming in mostly buying consumables? Todd Vasos : Well, we can see them buying a little bit of both. But consumables, especially in food, paper, cleaning categories and, by the way, one of the biggest growths that we've seen from that consumer base is in health and beauty. And that makes a lot of sense to us in all the work that we've done around that. Michael Lasser : And then just a quick follow up for John. How much incremental transportation cost pressure have you factored into your guidance for the rest of the year? And should we expect a wide variance in your comp between the third quarter and the fourth quarter? John Garratt : In terms of carrier rates, we've factored in basically what we see on the horizon as the anticipated costs there. That's all captured in the guidance. And as mentioned, we do anticipate that getting a little bit worse before it gets better and have factored that in, but again, have a lot of mitigating actions that we've also played in to help counteract the impact of that. So that's all played in. In terms of sales comps, we don't get into quarter-by-quarter. But would say that the impact of what we see from the large number of units rolling into the comp base helps counteract some of the laps to smooth it out somewhat over the back half of the year. Operator : Your next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : Todd, so 2 things I wanted to get into. First, produce. When that brings the remodel benefit up to 15%, is that evenly split between traffic and ticket, the incremental piece you're getting from produce, number one? Two, how many stores do you think ultimately can have produce? And then what's your shrink experience with that? Todd Vasos : Yes, those are all great questions, John. And those are the same questions that we continue to monitor here at Dollar General as we continue to learn more about selling produce outside of our market stores and now into some of our, call it, traditional and/or DGTP stores. But as you look at it, you can definitely see an increase in both ticket and traffic across these remodels, and you can see an even larger traffic increase when you have produce because you're at the top end of the 10% to 15% scale of increase. So it's great to see that it helps drive both traffic and ticket. And to your point, what we're managing right now is these are live goods. This is different than selling cans of corn as we all know. And so we're continuing to learn how to manage this in the stores. Our operators have done a great job in working through new processes. So the shrink is probably a little bit higher than where it will end up being, but I think you know us pretty well over the years, we won't do anything that isn't very accretive at the end. So we're pretty bullish about where those gross margins in produce could end up as we get more and more developed. And then your last question, well, how many could you do, well, we're not prepared yet to say, but we believe that there could be thousands of stores that could have this lineup. And we'll continue to work toward that as we learn more and more about produce. John Heinbockel : And then one last thing, this obviously is the first holiday season without Toys \"R\" Us. So -- and you can do a lot of business in toys. How do you think about what you want to do differently, without giving your playbook, this year versus past years? And is that -- do you think that's a very significant opportunity to acquire new customers? Todd Vasos : I believe that overall, that our category management team has done a fabulous job in our seasonal categories and especially in our toy categories. And we continue to make progress there. And we're seeing benefits right now from that progress. Is some of it from a competitor that's no longer with us? That could be some of it. But I do have to say that our category management team in and around toys has done a great job. And I've seen the lineup for holiday, and it's very, very strong. Operator : Your next question is from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : Most of my questions have been answered, but just on the acceleration in traffic here from 1Q to 2Q, just wondering if you could unpack that for us across the chain. And then on the pricing front, how are you guys feeling about your positioning vis-\u00e0-vis Walmart? Based on our work, it looks like you're pretty tight. Do you agree with that? And given that you are in a position of strength and given that you do have some advantages on the margin line, how are you thinking about the ability to chase units and to invest more in price given your positioning today? Todd Vasos : Yes, as you look at, we're, first of all, very happy with the 3.7% comp and very happy to see both traffic and ticket on the positive side. As you take a look at traffic, obviously, our consumable business drove a lot of our traffic gains and that's by design. We've always said that our consumable business will drive the traffic and our nonconsumable business will continue to enhance the basket and enhance our margin, and that's exactly how we saw Q2 unfold. And we believe that over time, that's how we'll continue to drive both traffic and ticket within our store. And as you look at our prices, we are as good at price today as we ever have been. I've been saying that for multiple quarters now, and we're looking very, very good across all classes of trade. And it's really evidenced by our market share gains and if that -- those market share gains are across all classes of trade and across the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week period. So this isn't a new phenomenon. We've been stealing share for quite a while. And it's again, I believe, because of that competitive box that we've put together. And I believe we've got the best execution at retail that's out there when you go across 15,000 stores and the ability to execute at the high level that we do. So those are all very additive for us as we look to continue to drive sales and comps in the future. And then lastly, in price, we've always said we'll continue to work the price lever where we believe it's necessary to continue to drive traffic and/or where our consumers are feeling the pinch. And so we continue to do that today. We're working the price lever in many different parts of the country today to continue to engage our consumer and to continue to have her shop with us more often, and just -- you'll continue to see that as we move forward. That's part of the playbook and has been for as many years as I've been here, Chuck. Charles Grom : Okay, great. And then just one quick one for John. Just on the comp here in the quarter. Can you frame out on how the comp trended by the month-by-month? And then in terms of August, anything you'd like to share on the start to the third quarter? John Garratt : What I would say is we just feel very good about the balance we saw in the quarter. Each one of the periods was strong. And as we mentioned, we saw a good balance across consumables and nonconsumables, too. So I think it was a very balanced performance for the quarter. And we feel great where we are right now with the initiatives in place, firing on all cylinders and building momentum. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. A replay of today's earnings release will be available shortly. Instructions for listening to the replay are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Todd Vasos : Thank you, Jennifer, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter results, particularly given the 2 major hurricanes that devastated communities in some of our most heavily penetrated areas in the South Eastern United States. We stayed focused on our initiatives, kept the customer at the center of everything we do, and our financial performance during the quarter demonstrated what this type of focus can produce. Before discussing our third quarter results, I want to express my gratitude to all of our teams who have worked so diligently in very difficult circumstances to serve the communities we call home. We recently visited with our field teams in the Carolinas and the Florida Panhandle where the damage was the greatest. I say it frequently but it bears repeating, I am so inspired by our team's consistent dedication to our mission of Serving Others.  Turning now to our third quarter performance. We delivered another solid quarter with strong growth on both the top and bottom lines. On the top line, our same-store sales growth of 2.8% resulted in our highest 2-year stack in 11 quarters. This quarter, our comp growth was primarily driven by our customers checking out with larger baskets. We believe this is a reflection of all the work we have done to make the box more relevant for our customers. As our customer's needs evolve, they are telling us they want a fuller shop from us and we're delivering with even more of the products they want at the values they need.  Year-to-date, through the 2018 third quarter, we posted 2.9% same-store sales growth, which continue to be driven by greater customer productivity. We feel good about our 39-week performance as well as the outlook for the rest of the year. We did, however, incur greater-than-anticipated disaster-related expenses during the third quarter, primarily as a result of the hurricanes. We have updated our full year 2018 operating margin rate and diluted EPS guidance to include the estimated impact of these expenses on the third and fourth quarter results. John will walk you through those details in just a moment.  As we continue to execute our strategic initiatives, we remain focused on our operating priorities, and we believe we are in a great position to finish the 2018 year on a strong note. Now let's recap some of the top line results for the third quarter. Net sales increased 8.7% to $6.4 billion compared to net sales of $5.9 billion in the third quarter of 2017. We continue to be very pleased with both the productivity from our new stores as well as the performance from our mature stores. Our 2.8% same-store sales increase was again led by our strong performance in consumables. We are listening to our customers and providing the products they want and need. This performance allows us to continue growing market share. We remain well positioned against all classes of trade, as evidenced by our market share gains in the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending November 3, 2018, as measured by syndicated data. We believe these share gains are coming from multiple retail channels and competitors underscoring the broad appeal of our value and convenience offerings. Further, as we continue to execute across our growth strategies and operating priorities, we believe we have an opportunity to capture incremental share from a variety of sources.  While it's always competitive in discount retail, pricing activity has remained rational and our pricing surveys indicate Dollar General continues to be well positioned across all geographic regions where we operate. We believe this positioning and our commitment to everyday low prices contributes to our market share gains.  We saw improvement in our non-consumable categories, which overall comped positively again in the third quarter. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales in our seasonal category, along with our best performance in the home category in 10 quarters. We remain focused on driving sales improvement in the non-consumable categories, which I will discuss with you in more detail later in the call. After John's discussion, I will also provide an update on our execution against our operating priorities and strategic growth initiatives. With that, I will now turn the call over to John to provide you with more detail on the third quarter financial results. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. I will now take you through some of the important financial details for the quarter and year-to-date. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. As Todd has already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29.5% in the third quarter, a decrease of 39 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in the LIFO provision, the ongoing product category mix shift to consumables as well as higher sales of lower margin consumable products, higher markdowns and increased transportation costs. We recorded a $12.5 million LIFO provision in the third quarter of 2018 compared with a $0.5 million LIFO provision in the third quarter of 2017. This LIFO increase was attributable to cost increases, which were primarily due to direct and indirect impacts of both tariffs and the increased transportation cost pressures.  As you've heard from us and other retailers throughout the year, our business has continued to see the effect of higher transportation costs due to the tight carrier market and higher fuel prices, among other factors. While we have navigated sales mix challenges and markdowns as part of the retail landscape for many years, the headwind from transportation cost is a relatively more recent challenge impacting our gross margin. We anticipate this trend to continue primarily as a result of higher carrier rates. These factors were partially offset by another quarter of improved inventory shrink.  SG&A as a percent of sales was 22.6%, a decrease of 21 basis points. The leverage in the third quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by reductions in incentive compensation, lower advertising and supplies expenses, and lower repairs and maintenance expenses as a percentage of sales. Partially offsetting those decreases were an estimated $14.1 million in hurricane-related expenses as well as a $5.8 million year-over-year increase in other disaster-related expenses, both of which were greater than anticipated.  In total, these hurricanes and disaster-related expenses had a negative 31 basis points impact on 2018 third quarter SG&A as a percent of net sales. Despite the significant negative impact of these disaster-related expenses, we were able to gain SG&A leverage, even as we continue to invest in the business and in opportunities for long-term growth. We expect to continue investing in strategic initiatives that we believe will extend our runway for growth.  Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 35.8% in the third quarter of 2017. This decrease is primarily attributable to the lower federal tax rate in the 2018 period as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  Finally, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.26, which includes an estimated net negative impact of $0.05 related to the hurricanes and disaster-related expenses that I just mentioned. It is important to note that in the fourth quarter, we also expect to report about $0.04 in expenses related to the third quarter hurricanes. These third and fourth quarter expenses are both incorporated into our updated guidance. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remained very strong. Merchandise inventories were $4 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2018, up 10.6% overall and up 4% on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory remains in great shape, and we are focused over the long-term on managing inventory growth to be in-line with or below our sales growth. Further, our ability to generate significant cash flow from operations also continues to be a great strength of the business.  Throughout the first 3 quarters of 2018, we generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $1.5 billion, an increase of $371 million or 32.5%. Year-to-date through the third quarter of 2018, total capital expenditures were $551 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, continued investments in 2 distribution centers under construction and spending related to the previously announced acceleration of certain key initiatives.  During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of our common stock for $298 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $77 million. Through the end of the third quarter, we returned a total of $879 million in 2018 to our shareholders through our share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments. From the inception of our share repurchase program in December 2011 through the end of the third quarter of 2018, we have repurchased $5.8 billion or 88 million shares of our common stock. At the end of the third quarter, the remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $706 million. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and we continue to be disciplined and focused on financial returns. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, most notably new store expansions as well as infrastructure to support future growth. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt-to-EBITDA.  Finally, moving on to our updated fiscal 2018 guidance, which replaces the guidance we provided on August 30, 2018, let me remind you about some of the key drivers. As we've noted throughout fiscal 2018, our earnings outlook includes our current expectations regarding the impact of transportation cost headwinds, sales mix margin pressures and investment in our strategic initiatives. Our guidance also reflects our year-to-date results and outlook for the remainder of the year, including the higher-than-anticipated disaster-related expenses for both the third and fourth quarters, primarily due to Hurricanes Florence and Michael.  For fiscal 2018, we now expect net sales growth to be approximately 9%. For same-store sales growth, we expect to be in the middle of our previously provided range of mid- to high 2%. For fiscal year 2018, we now expect our operating margin rate to be modestly below our fiscal year 2017 operating margin rate. This reflects the greater-than-anticipated disaster expenses I mentioned earlier. Additionally, we now expect diluted EPS for the full year to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.05. Our diluted EPS guidance now assumes our tax rate will be in the range of 21% to 22%. We are narrowing the range of our expectations for capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 to $725 million to $775 million. Our outlook for fiscal 2018 real estate projects remains unchanged, and we expect to repurchase a minimum of $850 million of shares but will be opportunistic depending on our cash flow and other factors.  We're pleased with our position as we enter the holiday season and we're excited about the business. We believe we're implementing the right actions to help mitigate headwinds and maximize our sales growth opportunities. As always, we are focused on carefully controlling expenses even as we make targeted, proactive investments. We continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistently strong financial performance, while positioning our business for long-term growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ability to drive profitable same-store sales growth, deliver healthy new store returns, generate strong cash flow from operations and create long-term shareholder value.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. We are pleased with our financial results and are proud of the team's focus. I want to take the next few minutes to walk through how we are executing against our operating priorities and give you an update on the progress we are making on our long-term strategic growth initiatives.  Starting with our first priority of driving profitable sales growth. Our portfolio of top line initiatives is contributing to the strong year-to-date performance we have seen through the third quarter of 2018. These initiatives are designed to enhance the value and convenience proposition for our customers, offering them the trust and simple solutions they seek from us every day. Our cooler expansion continues to be an important sales initiative, particularly in mature stores. The team has done a fantastic job increasing the average number of cooler doors across the chain, and we are seeing a great return on this investment. As of the end of the third quarter, we have installed more than 20,000 cooler doors across our mature store base in fiscal 2018. Based on the success of this initiative, we anticipate continuing our cooler expansion efforts in 2019. During the third quarter, we also continued to ramp up optimized queue lines throughout select stores. The performance of these queue lines remained very strong, exceeding our own expectations. We now have the queue line enhancement in approximately 7,500 stores across the chain. Given the continued success of this rollout, we anticipate expanding this initiative in 2019 as well.  We continue to be very excited about the early results from our Better For You initiative, which is performing well above our initial goals. We launched Better For You just a few months ago in response to feedback from our customers who are starting to look for healthier food options at affordable prices. We are very pleased to be able to provide these product options to our customers at attractive price points that fit their budget. Currently, we have approximately 2,700 stores that are carrying a great selection of Better For You products, including several items under our Good & Smart private brand. In fact, over the last 4-week period of the third quarter, half of our top 10 unit movers within Better For You were Good & Smart branded items. We believe that the Better For You products appeal broadly to our customers and that we can roll out this offering to additional stores in 2019. In addition to these initiatives, we are excited about the holiday season and our product offerings as well as several exciting sales campaigns we'll be running. In particular, I'm excited to note that we are now offering the LEGO toy brand in all of our stores for the first time. Not only are we bringing a trusted and beloved toy brand to our customers during the holidays, we have also secured the only LEGO brand partnership within our channel. In addition to merchandising, our store operation teams are hard at work enhancing the customer's shopping experience and driving productivity within the store.  We continue to see improvements in overall customer satisfaction scores. We believe this is a direct result of our focus on friendliness, on-shelf availability, store cleanliness and speed of checkout. We monitor these metrics closely, and we are continually talking with our customers. The data show that important -- the improvements in these areas are correlated with improved customer experiences, which we believe fosters greater loyalty and leads to sales growth.  We have previously discussed our opportunities to further enhance gross margins. Our initiatives related to many of these opportunities are underway and continue to deliver results. For example, our efforts and investments in the inventory shrink reduction continue to pay benefits in the third quarter, as we saw our eighth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in the shrink rate. Shrink improvement remains a near-term gross margin driver and we are executing on multiple initiatives, including Electronic Article Surveillance, defensive merchandising and increased use of technology such as video-enabled exception-based reporting.  We believe there is still runway for improvement, and we expect to see continued benefit from investments in these shrink initiatives. As we noted last quarter, we are successfully reducing shrink while also increasing on-shelf availability. This balance is hard to achieve and can be tough to maintain. To further support our ability to sustain and drive on-shelf availability even higher, we are putting a number of new initiatives in place to support and drive sales growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond. These efforts dovetail nicely with our focus on driving customer traffic as well. In addition to shrink reduction, we also have other longer-term opportunities to enhance gross margin through a number of efforts.  Starting with distribution and transportation, we continue to focus on reducing stem miles, improving load optimization, growing and diversifying our carrier base and expanding our private fleet. With regards to our private fleet, we remain on track to expand from 80 tractors at the end of fiscal 2017 to approximately 200 tractors by the end of the fiscal year. 200 tractors would cover approximately 10% of our outbound freight needs. But we believe the added flexibility and learnings can also help us down the road in the event of future carrier rate fluctuations. We continue to evaluate opportunities to drive efficiencies and productivity within our distribution network to support profitable sales growth. Our distribution centers currently under construction in Longview, Texas; Amsterdam, New York, both remain on schedule to begin shipping in the 2019 calendar year.  Other gross margin opportunities include our efforts around category management and private brands, in particular. Throughout fiscal 2018, we have executed the strategy to promote our portfolio of value-priced, high-quality private brands. Our efforts have included a relaunch of our core health and beauty brand, Studio Selection; a refinement of our advertising strategy and shifted more of our circular space to showcase our private brands; and advertising campaigns that highlight compare and save options versus national brands; and of course, our money-back guarantee on private brands.  Foreign sourcing remains an opportunity over the long-term as well. Currently, our efforts include strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs on Dollar General and our customers. Over the last several years, we have directly imported approximately 5% to 6% of our purchases at cost, with the current tariffs in place, including the most recent wave at 10%, we have a relatively low exposure on direct imports. Depending on the scope of future rate increase or expansion of products subject to tariffs, could have a more significant impact on our business and on our customer's budget.  Given that backdrop, the team is working diligently to mitigate the impact where possible and to minimize the need for price increases. Short term, we did opportunistic forward buying to get in front of the tariffs on some items. We have longstanding relationships with our vendors and we are working closely with them to find ways, when possible, to reduce cost. This could include shifting manufacturing to other countries, re-engineering the products or finding substitute products that are not subject to these tariffs. In addition to the potential tariff impact, we are watching key economic factors that impact our customers. While the economy appears to be doing well, we know that our core customer is always challenged. With concerns about health care, inflation and rent expenses and fluctuating gas prices, we know she remains very concerned about her budget. Our customers are at the center of everything we do, and we remain committed to serving them with the everyday low prices they have come to know and appreciate from Dollar General.  Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk model for real estate growth continues to be a core strength of the business. In addition to the tremendous contributions from new stores, our remodel program continues to add significantly to our growth. Collectively, these real estate efforts have allowed us to extend our runway for long-term growth. As a reminder, our real estate model focuses on 5 metrics to ensure that new store growth is the best use of our capital. These metrics include new store productivity, actual sales performance, average returns, cannibalization and the payback period. We have consistently hit our overall goals for these metrics, and we are very pleased with our overall new store returns, and we remain committed to investing our capital effectively to drive strong financial returns.  This year, we shared with you our plan to execute approximately 2,000 real estate projects, including 900 new store openings, 1,000 mature store remodels and 100 store relocations. We are on track to achieve these goals by the end of the fiscal year. This year, through the end of the third quarter, we have opened 750 new stores, remodeled 925 stores and relocated 92 stores. Of the 925 remodeled stores, 359 were remodeled in to the Dollar General Traditional Plus format or DGTP, which is the traditional store size with an expanded cooler count. We included a fresh produce section in a 107 of these DGTP remodels. As a reminder, our remodel store delivers a 4% to 5% comp lift on average and a DGTP remodel delivers on average of 10% to 15% comp lift. And when produce is included in a DGTP, it delivers a comp lift on average at the high end of that range. We currently have approximately 425 stores throughout the chain that carry produce.  We are excited to announce our plans for 2019 real estate growth. For our fiscal year 2019, we plan to open 975 new stores, remodel 1,000 mature stores and relocate 100 stores. We are proud of the team's ability to support approximately 2,075 real estate projects in total. Of the 1,000 planned remodels, we expect approximately 500 to be in the DGTP format. We also expect to add produce to approximately 200 of these stores. Of our 975 anticipated new stores, we plan to open approximately 10 in the DGX format. As a reminder, DGX stores are about half the size of a traditional Dollar General store and have a product selection that is tailored to vertical living customers. We currently have 3 DGX stores, which overall are doing well versus our expectations. We are excited to continue investing in this innovative concept.  Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending. We continue to refine our process and have developed a culture highly focused on examining costs and expenses. Our spending is filtered through 3 criteria. First, is it customer-facing? Second, does it align with our strategic priorities? And third, how does it impact our risk profile? We continue to focus efforts in the stores on space optimization and simplifying our operations by reducing unproductive inventory, operating complexity and product movement within the stores. Our teams are focused on these efforts through optimization of our operations and leveraging technology in new and exciting ways. We will continue to focus on our underlying principles to keep the business simple, while moving quickly to capture growth opportunities, control expenses and always seek to be a low-cost operator. Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people, as we believe they are a competitive advantage. Our investments in wages continue to pay benefits in the third quarter. As of the end of the third quarter, store manager turnover was trending toward our all-time best on record. And our time-to-fill open positions was also at an all-time best. We continue to monitor the wage environment carefully and believe we remain well positioned across the organization as illustrated by robust applicant flow at every level. As we have seen the market change, we have proven that we are able to and ready to adapt to any change. We have continued to place an emphasis on employee engagement and our recent actions reflect our commitment to listen and respond to their feedback.  In 2018 alone, we have expanded the benefits we offer employees to address a number of their needs. For example, we now offer expanded paid parental leave for mothers and fathers, adoption assistance, day 1 access to benefits for store managers and a new dress code policy for store employees that they really seem to like. Coupled with existing benefits such as tuition assistance and college course credits for our store manager training, we believe we are providing our employees with a comprehensive set of benefits. And perhaps more importantly, we are continuing to communicate directly with our employees and giving them a voice. We believe all of these factors have contributed to the increasing employee engagement scores that we have seen.  Even with these great benefits, we still believe that the opportunity to build a long-term career at Dollar General is the most important currency we have to attract and retain top talent. The ability to advance the higher paying and higher responsibility jobs in a relatively short amount of time provides a great opportunity for our employees to grow in meaningful ways, both personally and professionally. Remaining the employer-of-choice is an important priority for us, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to attract and retain talent. Finally, before I open the call for questions, I want to quickly update you on our recent progress executed against our digital and non-consumable strategic growth initiatives. I'll start with our digital initiatives. In the near-term, our digital strategy remains focused on using technology to improve the in-store experience by offering customers even more personalization and convenience. Launched earlier this year, the DG GO! app is now live in approximately 250 stores, which completes our rollout for 2018. As a reminder, the app allows customers to use their phone to scan items as they shop and then skip the checkout line by using the DG GO! kiosk. We estimate we currently have more than 20,000 active monthly users and the feedback on the app continues to be positive. It seems to be fitting very nicely with our customer shopping habits and creating an even more convenient frictionless shopping experience.  We know that our customers who more frequently engage with our digital tools tend to shop with us more often and check out with larger average baskets. We currently have more than 15 million subscriber accounts within our Digital Coupon program, including 1.3 million new subscribers in the third quarter alone. These subscribers have clicked more than 700 million coupons this year in 2018. Deploying innovative technology across our stores remains an incredible opportunity for us, and we are investing accordingly. We look forward to continuing to test, analyze and learn as we look to further enhance the use of technology.  Turning to our non-consumable initiative. In the second quarter, we began a test of a bold, new and expanded assortment in key non-consumable classes, home, domestics, housewares, party and occasion. As a reminder, this initiative is focused on first, offering a new, differentiated and limited assortment that will change throughout the year. Second, displaying the new offering in high-traffic areas with improved adjacencies and increased focus on key classes to enhance the in-store experience and create a sense of purchase urgency. And third, continuing to deliver exceptional value by pricing the majority of the offering at $5 or less. While the amount of space that we dedicate to non-consumables remains the same, we believe this merchandising strategy will drive greater sell-through and enhance gross margin over time. We have added this assortment to approximately 600 stores and are on track to have approximately 700 total stores up and running by the end of the fiscal year. We are still in the early stages. That said, we are now working through our third replenishment cycle in the first set of stores where we launched this initiative, and we remain encouraged by the results we've seen.  In closing, we delivered another solid quarter and we're proud of our results. We continue to be excited about our business and believe we operate in the most attractive sector in retail. We have a differentiated business model that leverages our real estate expertise and our low-cost operating experience with our laser focus on delivering value and convenience to our customers.  I want to thank our more than 135,000 employees across the company for their dedication of fulfilling our mission of Serving Others. Your commitment was certainly on display this quarter as you rallied around our communities in need. As we enter the busy holiday season, I also want to express my gratitude to all employees for your hard work, helping our customers save time and money every day. You are our most important resource, and we appreciate your contributions to Dollar General's success. We are excited about our position and we are working hard to finish out 2018 strong and head into 2019 with great momentum.  With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So on the gross margin line, I was hoping for a more color in terms of some of the puts and takes as you look out for Q4 and also just some initial thoughts on what headwinds you think could continue into next year? John Garratt : Yes, so I'll talk about the performance thus far and then talk about -- address your question in terms of what we see looking forward. As you look year-to-date, our gross margin is down 10 basis points. In Q3, we did see some increased near-term pressures from carrier rates, tariffs, coupled with the ongoing headwinds -- we always manage through with mix and markdown pressures. As we look to -- ahead in the near term, I think these pressures will continue with the carrier rates and tariffs. The team continues to mitigate those, and it's done a really great job of that, but it's hard to say how long those pressures will persist. But I would say, as I look over the long term, we still see an opportunity to grow our gross margin, enhance it, reinvest in the business as needed. As we look at the levers, there's multiple levers within gross margin and SG&A. As you look at gross margin, we continue to see great performance from shrink, 8 consecutive quarters of sequential improvement there, and with the investments we've made, the process rigor, we see that continuing. We just completed putting 10,000, growing our EAS units from 5,000 to 10,000 and seeing great results there. Team does a great job of category management. We continue to see opportunity to increase our private label penetration, our foreign sourcing penetration and our non-consumable sales. We're pleased to see positive comps again on our non-consumables. And as Todd mentioned, pleased with what we're seeing from the non-consumable initiatives. On the supply chain side, while we do have the headwind of transportation costs facing everybody, the team is doing a great job, has been proactively mitigating that. We continue to open new DCs, 2 opening this year, which will reduce stem miles, continue to reduce load optimization, drive DC productivity. Very pleased with the results we're seeing from our private fleet as we step that up from 80 to 200 tractors based on the success we've seen and continue to expand and diversify our carrier base. So a lot of levers here within gross margin. And as we look at SG&A, we're pleased to leverage our SG&A again for the second consecutive quarter since we anniversaried the investment we made last year in our store manager compensation, which is paying off very nicely for us. So as you look across all these, while there are some near-term headwinds, over the long term, we see an ability to enhance our gross margin and operating margin overall as we balance all the levers within operating margin. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And a quick follow-up, so LIFO provision seem to be a bigger headwind this quarter. Do you expect that to continue into Q4? John Garratt : Yes, if you look at the key drivers of the LIFO provision, the $12.5 million we recorded, it was primarily attributable to direct and indirect impacts of tariffs and increased transportation cost pressures. Those do persist, but I will say, as you look at Q3 because you're looking at the end of the year, because a lot has occurred in Q3, you had to reflect the impact to the first 3 quarters there. There will be an impact in Q4, a proportionate amount of that and to the extent anything else increases or decreases that will change the LIFO provisions. And all this, of course, is contemplated in our guidance. Operator : The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays Capital. Karen Short : Just wanted to follow up on that a little bit. So in terms of looking forward, I guess, I mean, I'm talking about '19, it seems that transport should mitigate slightly. And it doesn't sound like you will have -- be making any labor investments into '19. Can you maybe just give a little color on that if that's an accurate way to think about '19? John Garratt : Yes, you know what I'll say is, as we look forward -- we'll be coming out with guidance later for next year -- but what I would say is, as we look forward, we continue to see ourselves as a double-digit adjusted EPS grower. To your point, it's hard to say how long the carrier rate pressure will continue, but we feel we're very well positioned with the mitigating actions that we're taking as that stabilizes. To your point on labor, as we look at labor costs, we're very well positioned right now with the investment we made in store manager compensation last year, now we've anniversaried that, we're seeing great results in terms of we're on pace for the best we've seen around store manager turnover and applicant flows and staffing levels. And we see throughout the organization, at the store level, we're very well positioned in terms of staffing and applicant flows. And as we look at it, we're competitive, not just on wages, but the other benefits that Todd mentioned that we've added this year for the overall compensation as well as when you just look at the growth opportunity within Dollar General, that's a real compelling driver for people who want to join Dollar General as they can advance rapidly through the organization if they're really looking at the career, so as we look at it, we're well positioned, we'll look market-by-market to make sure we stay competitive as we are now, but we don't see a major investment on the horizon like we had to make -- we made last year proactively. So as you look at the levers, the fundamentals of the business remain very strong. We continue to see a long runway for growth. With new unit development, we continue to see great store-level economics and great returns, we continue to see our returns at the high end of that 20% -- [ to 20%] after-tax IRR, which again is burdened with the impact of cannibalization. The sales initiatives continue to perform well. We continue to grow units and share. And we have multiple levers, as I mentioned, within gross margin, SG&A, and in turn the business generates a tremendous amount of cash, which we can reinvest in high-return projects, like new store growth, strategic initiatives and the infrastructure. So it's a very strong business model, a very resilient business model, and we still see ourselves as 10% growers over the long-term. Karen Short : Okay. Thanks for that And I just wanted to ask quickly about traffic. I mean, traffic obviously was positive in the third -- or second quarter and then it went flat this quarter. Maybe just a little color on how we should think about traffic in 4Q? And I'm just wondering if there was any hurricane impacts on the traffic? Todd Vasos : Yes, as you look at traffic, we're squarely focused on driving that top line to include that the traffic that you mentioned. Being flat, we would like to have seen a little bit more on the traffic side, but I have to say, the actions that the team has taken to drive that top line is really paying benefits in a fuller basket shop and that's really where we're seeing the benefit right now. But I could tell you that the team, right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are squarely focused on 2019. As you can imagine, we're 6 months out or longer. And stay tuned as we roll-out our '19 initiatives, there are some really good initiatives around driving both that top line and that traffic number into '19. We feel that that long-term, that traffic number being positive is one of our most important currencies. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Year-to-date, your comp is trending just below 3% and you have an easier comparison in the fourth quarter, and you're guiding to maybe a 2% to 2.5% as implied by your outlook. Why wouldn't it be better than that? Have you seen a slowdown to start the fourth quarter? John Garratt : Yes, what I would say is, as you look at, you're first looking at Q3, we saw stable performance throughout the quarter. If you look at the first period of the quarter versus last period of the quarter, they were comparable and solid throughout -- and positive on both consumables and non-consumables. As you look at the full year guidance, it was a minor adjustment. We had said previously that we're looking at mid- to high on comp growth and anchored [folks] towards the middle of that. And I think if you do the math on that that would suggest a material change in the trajectory there. And again, we feel very good about the initiatives in place and how they're performing, the fundamentals of the business and continuing to take share from all channels of retailers. Michael Lasser : And then my follow-up is, you did tweak your guidance on the cost side because -- largely because of the hurricanes. Can you give us some more depth on what's specifically driving the $0.09 incremental headwind? How many stores were impacted? Is this mainly due to store damage and lost sales? And is there something else going on? John Garratt : Yes, so as you alluded to with the guidance change, it was primarily driven by the $0.09 impact of the unanticipated disaster-related expenses. As we called out, that was primarily driven by Hurricanes Florence and Michael. And within that, the type of -- we haven't disclosed the number of stores impacted. But what I will say is as you look at our footprint, we're particularly dense in coastal Carolinas and coastal Florida as well as in rural areas where lot of the heaviest damage was. So we had a high store concentration there. As you look at the nature of the cost, it was store damage and repairs, inventory damage were the key drivers there. As we did mention, while hurricanes were the primary driver here, that cost figure that we provided also included the impact of other disasters, most notably floods and fires, again, that were of an unusual nature above and beyond the normal run rate that we -- has been. So that was the primary driver of the guidance change as well as just other miscellaneous puts and takes. Michael Lasser : Were there any other significant call-outs that motivated you to adjust the guidance? Or maybe give us a little bit more detail on those? John Garratt : So I would say if not for the impact of the disasters, the $0.09 impact we wouldn't have seen the need to adjust guidance. Within the other $0.01 there, there's various puts and takes that I mentioned, including the higher transportation costs and tariffs net impact on LIFO. But obviously within there a lot of puts and takes on that other $0.01. Operator : The next question will come from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Still a lot of moving parts regarding the tariff conversation. But could you just give a little bit more detail on how your business has prepared for the potential of incremental tariffs, the impact you're seeing in the P&L today? And what -- to what extent you have already mitigated some of those additional potential costs in 2019? And maybe just taking a step back on gross margins. You outlined earlier, John, a number of positives and tailwinds on the gross margin front. But if we look back over the last 5 years, I think gross margins are down roughly 90 to 100 basis points. How should we think about maybe the longer-term opportunity on gross margin and where that can get back to? Todd Vasos : Sure, Paul. So as you look at the tariffs, obviously we, like a lot of folks out there in retail, we're very proactive around the possible tariff impact that we saw coming down. We took a lot of proactive steps, including as we talked about, mitigating steps to order some products in a little bit early. So some opportunity to move some products in a little earlier, we did that. We've been working diligently with our community overseas, particularly in China, our offices there and our vendor community to ensure that we can reduce some costs. We've got great relationships, big relationships with those vendors over there, those factories and players. And we've been able to do a lot around reducing some of the costs to also move around some of these tariffs. And then lastly, we continue to move products and look for ways to move product out of China. That's not a phenomenon that happens overnight. But if you go back, we've been talking about moving products out of China for quite a while and not being so China-centric. We've been working hard at that. So I believe we are a little bit ahead of the game there. We continue to work hard to move our product lines and different opportunities to move things out of China itself. As you look at gross margins, just in general, I would say the team has done a really good job in the environment that is out there right now. I can tell you that we've got a lot of levers that we continue to pull in gross margin, as John has indicated, and we continue to work really hard around making sure that whatever we do at the end of the day, is that we've got the right price for the consumer, and that's always top of mind for us. And I believe you see through our surveys that we are in very, very good shape on pricing. Because at the end of the day, in long-term, that will be the real litmus test on -- for the consumer on your health as a company. And we believe our share gains as of late have come because of our pricing and our pricing activity, and that's always been there and always will continue to be there. But we stayed really focused on margins to deliver both at top line and the bottom line. But operating margin is really where our focus is and we'll continue to work all the levers. Paul Trussell : And just a quick follow-up. I appreciate you giving your forward guidance regarding store expansion and remodel opportunities. Maybe just quickly, give a little bit more detail around what you see as the white space opportunity? Are these stores being opened, and mostly these are backfilling current markets, to what extent are you looking to penetrate urban markets? And also what have you seen in terms of your latest class of stores from a productivity and return standpoint? Todd Vasos : Sure. As you take a look at it, the team's done a great job over the years. It's one of our core strength is finding the right opportunity out there, the right real estate and then opening stores. And over the years, Paul, we have done a very good job in really watching the key metrics that we talked about. I can tell you that the latest class of stores in 2018 had been coming right out of the ground just where we thought it would. So again, right in that upper 90s to 100% of pro forma range and that continues to be right where we believe the sweet spot is. And as we continue to look out, we think there's a tremendous amount of runway still to open up stores in the continental United States. The class of 2019 will look very similar to the class of 2018 as far as the makeup between rural, metro and more urban-type settings. So again, heavily driven toward the -- a little bit more driven toward the rural communities. But yes, over time, we believe that opening more and more stores in metro is the right thing to do. And we have strategic goals and opportunities and initiatives centered around that that we're going to talk about a little bit further as we move into 2019. But suffice to say that our formats that we've developed over the years has really given us the opportunity to open the white space up, and we still believe there's 12,000 to 13,000 opportunities to put a Dollar General store out in the continental United States and in areas that are not as familiar as evidenced by opening 10 next year, DGX stores, is what our goal is. And those are in vertical living, more densely populated areas in some key cities out there across the U.S. So we feel as good as ever about our real estate portfolio. And to include our remodel program, which is very, very strong and continues to throw off fabulous comps as we continue to move forward too. So we've got a great runway ahead of us and we're capitalizing on that very quickly. Operator : The next question will come from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Just wanted to go back 1 second just to the revised outlook. Kind of the puts and takes and tell me if I'm thinking about this correctly as well, right? If you kind of take the mid-point of your new guidance on the EPS lines in the commentary around the EBIT, you have done a great job of telling kind of what the hurricane impact is. And then if you kind of though add the lower tax rate benefit in there, it seems like there's still a little bit just kind of more of a core EBIT decline there. From the commentary, it sounds like that's largely really around the growth side with the transportation costs and tariffs. I guess, is that kind of a good sum-up? Is that true? And are there any other factors for 4Q specifically that we all should be thinking about? John Garratt : I think that is a good summary. As you stated, the biggest driver there was the hurricane, disaster-related expenses. And as you look at that other $0.01 there were puts-and-takes. In retail, you're always battling through mix and markdowns and we've been doing that for years very well. I think the piece that added a little extra pressure this quarter is -- and for the near term is the higher transportation costs and tariffs. But I think that was a good summary overall. And again, over the long-term, we see a lot of levers to not only mitigate these but enhance our gross margin and operating margin. Vincent Sinisi : For sure, okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up. This is a kind of more of a big picture thought. When we're thinking about kind of the future of how you continue to generate solid ticket and traffic, you talked about numerous initiatives, of course as well as kind of mix changes and tests and formats. It seems at least like with some of the store growth plan and different formats on the smaller ones and the plus -- I guess the basic question here is, what are some of the bigger learnings so far? And while maybe '19 store growth is going to be similar to '18, kind of how do you see the mix and also may be the makeup of the sizes of the stores may be changing going forward? Todd Vasos : That's a great question. We look at that obviously very often internally, and we actually build our initiatives around those very thoughts. And I can tell you that we intentionally develop these additional formats to be able to move into certain demographics across the U.S. where a one-size-fits-all mentality is really not the way to be productive and to make the most of your real estate portfolio and of course, driving top line and traffic as you indicated. So having those opportunities to put stores, for instance, with a produce selection in areas that are more food deserts in the United States, both in the rural communities and by the way, in more metro settings, we find that we can drive a tremendous amount of traffic that way. Same thing with our cooler expansion that we've been very, very open about over the last many years. I would tell you that if you're thinking about a baseball game here, we're still probably only in the bottom of the fifth inning when it comes to our cooler expansion opportunities, both in our mature store base, and of course, as we continue to refine our Dollar General Plus and DGTP concepts with broader cooler expansions in them. And again, I think once you look at this, our consumers are voting with their pocketbooks and we're driving nice comps through the box today. And when you look at these remodels throwing up 10% to 15% comp lift in DGTP with these additional coolers and then the high end with produce, we feel that we've got a real good runway ahead of us to continue to drive both traffic, ticket and overall sales very profitably, which is our first priority out there is driving that profitable sales growth. So overall, we believe the portfolio is very strong. Now as you move in the outer years, you will see a mix change to a -- it won't be a radical change, it will be a slow, methodical change to a little bit more of a heavier metro mix as we continue to build the portfolio out. But it will be -- we'll signal that very well over time and we'll make sure that, in fact, we do it very methodically. And again, as I indicated, we'll talk about in 2019 some initiatives we have around our urban setting and our urban initiatives that we're working on very hard right now out there. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Aaron Grey : This is Aaron Grey on for Matt Boss. As we think about your underlying EPS profile, are we right to think that ex the impact of hurricanes and tax reform, we're still on track to hit roughly around 10% EPS growth for the year? And then as we look forward, any change to your ability to drive double-digit EPS growth for the next few years? John Garratt : No, I think that's the way to look at it. As you look at this year, we feel very good with the guidance we provided that, that provides a very strong top line, bottom line performance for the year, while reinvesting in our initiatives that is consistent with that long-term goal of driving double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. And as I mentioned earlier, as we look over the long-term, we continue to see ourselves as a double-digit EPS grower with the strong fundamentals of the business on new store growth with the performance Todd mentioned, driving comp growth with the initiatives in place, continuing to grow units and share with the number of levers we have within operating margin I mentioned and the tremendous amount of cash this business generates to reinvest. We see this as a strong resilient business model with the fundamentals and change, and I think that's the right way to think about it. Aaron Grey : Okay, great. And then on SG&A, are we still right to think about 2.5% to 3% as the underlying fixed cost hurdle for the fourth quarter and then also as we look into 2019? John Garratt : Well, we don't break down guidance specifically between SG&A and gross margin by quarter. We did give the overall guidance for the year. But I would say our goal remains to leverage SG&A in that 2.5% to 3% range, and we're pleased to have done that -- the 2 quarters, the last 2 quarters as we anniversaried that important investment in our store manager compensation and over the long-term, a lot of levers to do that and that's our goal and intention. Operator : The final question is from Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Garrett Klumpar : It's actually Garrett Klumpar for Greg. Just wanted to touch on the DG GO! app continue to see pretty good growth there. Just wondering, you called out improving the in-store experience is the biggest near term on digital but what -- just wondered if we could get a little more color on what specifically you think are the other key areas of improving that convenience offering for customers? Todd Vasos : Sure. As we talk to our customers all the time and as you know, convenience is measured differently depending on what customer you ask. But I could tell you that we're squarely focused on making the convenience offering within our 4 walls even more convenient. Again, we're very convenient as far as where we're located, we're convenient you can park at the front door, walk in, you can get in and out of stores with a 5 or 6 item shopping experience in less than 10 minutes, 5 in the most -- in most cases. But you know what, our consumers are also saying, how do you even get more convenience. So the DG GO! app does that. Where she can skip the checkout line by checking herself out. And what we've seen is good adoption so far with that app. Again, only 250 stores, like everything here at Dollar General, we test and we learn before we move and roll out, and we want to make sure that the return is as strong as we believe it will be for this initiative. So stay tuned, more to come. We believe that we're on the right track because again, it's about making sure that our consumers have a frictionless shopping experience, quick in and out, and we give her exactly what she wants here at Dollar General. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the allotted time for the Q&A session. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Jennifer, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We ended 2018 on a strong sales note, with a 4% comp in the fourth quarter. While we certainly faced various challenges throughout the year, we believe 2018 was a great year for our employees, our shareholders, and we remained squarely focused on taking care of our customers. As we head into 2019, we are excited to have so many new opportunities ahead of us. During today's call, I will cover 5 main topics. I'll start with key highlights from the fourth quarter results. Then I'll update you on our progress and outlook for our digital and non-consumable initiatives. Third, I'll lay out 2 new strategic initiatives we are excited to be launching. Fourth, I'll give you an update on the results we are achieving with our operating priorities. And finally, I'll finish with our operating plans for fiscal 2019. John will provide you with some 2018 financial highlights, guidance for fiscal 2019 and our perspective on Dollar General's long-term growth. Turning to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial performance. We delivered a very strong top line in the fourth quarter, with net sales increasing 8.5% to $6.6 billion compared to net sales of $6.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full fiscal year, net sales increased 9.2% to $25.6 billion compared to net sales of $23.5 billion in fiscal 2017. The strong net sales performance throughout fiscal 2018 was a balance between performance from both new stores and mature stores. During 2018, we continued to gain market share in highly consumable product sales, which was a key driver of our strong sales performance. Syndicated data shows that we had mid- to high single-digit growth in both units and dollars over the 4, 12, 24 and 52-week periods ending January 26, 2019. For full year comp sales, we posted a 3.2% growth rate for fiscal 2018, marking our 29th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. Given the overall strength of the economy in 2018, this continued growth underscores our belief that our business model can perform well in all economic cycles. We are proud to continue our legacy of serving the underserved by providing them with the value and convenience that they have come to expect from Dollar General. As I mentioned, we finished the year with a very strong 4% same-store sales growth rate in the fourth quarter. This growth resulted in our highest 2-year stack in 21 quarters and our third consecutive quarter of accelerated 2-year comp stack growth. The fourth quarter top line performance was driven by growth in both average transaction amount and customer traffic. This quarter's average transaction amount growth included expansion in average unit retail and increased units per basket. Driving profitable traffic is paramount to the health of our business over the long term. This quarter, we took steps to continue providing our customers with terrific value and focused on promotional activities that allowed us to take share for multiple classes of trade. We believe we can sustain these share gains in 2019, and that these investments attracted customers who will continue to shop at Dollar General. These actions were especially important in the fourth quarter, given the increased seasonal sales volumes seen across retail industry during this time of year. We achieved our goals of growing traffic and market share and continue to broaden our overall customer base. We were also pleased to deliver another quarter of solid growth in non-consumables. We are particularly excited about our performance in the home category, which led overall comp growth in the fourth quarter. The team is doing a great job in this category, which led to our best performance in home in many years. This is the first time in quite a while that we've seen a non-consumable category outcomp consumable growth. During the fourth quarter, we believe same-store sales benefited from the acceleration of February SNAP payments during the government shutdown. Based upon an analysis of EBT sales, we estimated this created an approximate 70 basis point benefit for same-store sales. As we head into 2019, we believe we have compelling opportunities to gain more market share, drive profitable traffic to our conveniently-located stores and deliver more of the products our customer seeks at the value she needs. We remain focused on these opportunities, and after John's discussion, I look forward to sharing how we are targeting our efforts in 2019. With that, I will now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. I would like to walk you through the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, and then I'll take a few minutes to discuss our fiscal 2019 financial guidance. I'll also provide you with some thoughts on our long-term business perspective. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which as a percentage of sales, was 31.2% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 91 basis points. This decrease was partially attributable to higher markdowns. As Todd mentioned, this quarter, we proactively invested in promotional activities to drive traffic and market share, and we believe we remain well positioned against all classes of trade and across all geographies where we operate. That said, pricing is always competitive in discount retail and we watch the environment very closely. In 2019, our strategy is to further optimize our promotional activities as we focus on driving profitable sales and traffic growth. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was also negatively impacted by lower initial markups on inventory purchases, an increase in the LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category, which generally has a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories, and the sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category. Partially offsetting these items was lower inventory shrink. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.6%, a decrease of 34 basis points. The decrease was driven by reductions in repairs and maintenance expenses, benefit costs and incentive compensation expenses and lower utilities as a percentage of net sales. Partially offsetting those decreases were approximately $11.7 million in hurricane-related expenses due to 2 hurricanes which occurred during the third quarter of 2018 as well as a $2.2 million year-over-year increase in other disaster-related expenses, both of which were greater than anticipated in our original fiscal year 2018 forecast. As a reminder, 2017 fourth quarter SG&A expense included costs related to accelerated store closures. Moving down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was an expense of 21.2%. This compares to a negative 18.9% tax rate in the fourth quarter last year, which was a benefit. The benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet at the new lower federal corporate tax rate as a result of federal tax reform. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.84, which includes an approximate $0.04 negative impact of disasters, the majority of which was driven by hurricanes that occurred in the third quarter. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remained strong at the end of fiscal 2018. Merchandise inventories were $4.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2018, up 13.5% overall and an increase of 7.3% on a per-store basis over the end of the 2017 fiscal year. Inventory levels increased in the back half of fiscal 2018 as we broadened the inventory to stock our new Longview, Texas, distribution center. Additionally, as we discussed with you last quarter, we proactively made some strategic and opportunistic forward inventory buys in part due to concerns over potential tariff increases. These buys aimed at keeping overall costs low contributed to the higher inventory level at year-end. As we noted in recent quarters, we have been successfully reducing shrink while also increasing on-shelf availability. This dynamic is difficult to both achieve and maintain. In 2019, we are taking action to update our inventory replenishment cycle to support even higher levels of on-shelf availability for our customers every day while continuing to take actions designed to further reduce shrink. We believe our inventory quality is in great shape, and our goal remains to drive inventory growth that is in line with or below our sales growth over time.  Fiscal 2018 was another year of strong cash flow from operations, which totaled $2.1 billion, an increase of $341 million or 18.9%. Total capital expenditures for 2018 were $734 million and included our planned investments in new stores remodels and relocations, continued investments in construction for 2 new distribution centers and spending related to the previously announced acceleration of certain key initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our common stock for $360 million and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $75 million. For the full year, we returned a total of $1.3 billion in capital to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. The remaining repurchase authorization at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $346 million, and yesterday, our board approved an additional $1 billion in incremental share repurchase authorization. Our capital allocation priorities aren't changed and we are focused on financial returns. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. Turning now to fiscal 2019. This year, we expect our core business to continue to deliver strong growth and allow us to invest in our ongoing strategic initiatives as well as the 2 new ones that Todd will discuss in greater detail shortly. Overall, our long-term financial performance goals remain squarely focused on delivering strong growth in net sales, comp store sales, operating profit and diluted EPS, which is also supported by our financial strategies. In some years, we will balance the decision to invest while delivering on our long-term goal of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We believe that net sales, comp store sales, operating profit and diluted EPS are the core metrics that you should be focusing on in order to gauge our progress. I will now provide you with our outlook on these metrics for 2019. For fiscal 2019, we expect net sales growth of approximately 7% and comp sales growth of approximately 2.5%. Moving on to profitability, I'd like to share a few insights with you. We are of course, laser focused on operating profit and operating profit margins. In 2019, we expect to grow operating profit by approximately 4% to 6%. Our goal is to improve operating profit margin over time, and we believe we are making the right operating decisions and investments to achieve this goal. This year, this means that we'll be making investments in strategic initiatives, including DG Fresh, a supply chain initiative; as well as Fast Track, an in-stock productivity and customer service initiative. While both of these initiatives are still in their early test phase, we believe these investments will allow us to enhance our operating margin profile over the long term. The associated investments, however, will pressure SG&A rates in the near term. With this as a backdrop, I'll now provide you with a few other insights into overall gross margin and SG&A spend for 2019. First, the changes to our inventory replenishment cycle that I mentioned earlier will have an initial gross margin price tag, mostly due to the impacts on product inventory mix. In addition, there will be a working capital outlay required. There is correlation between on-shelf availability and sales, and we believe these changes will position us to support and drive top line growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond. Second, on transportation. While we have seen some signs of stabilization in a more balanced marketplace, we anticipate that we could see continued transportation cost increases in 2019. Third, on tariffs. Our guidance assumes that the government maintains current tariff levels and the guidance does not contemplate any increases in rates or any additional tariff enactment. We believe that the first quarter gross margin will be the most pressured on a year-over-year basis, and that we will see improvements in the year-over-year comparison as the year progresses. Regarding SG&A, we will have start-up expenses related to the 2 new initiatives in addition to ongoing investments in other strategic initiatives. In total, we expect to spend approximately $50 million on these strategic initiatives in 2019, the majority of which will be in our 2 new initiatives. We expect these investments to pressure SG&A, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year. While these SG&A investments should improve gross margins and overall operating margin over time, they will move our SG&A leverage range above 2.5% to 3%. That said, we believe these investments will be accretive as early as 2020. Given these gross margin and SG&A expense factors, we expect operating margins to be more pressured during the first half of the year. Based on these dynamics, we are providing fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share guidance of $6.30 to $6.50. Our diluted EPS guidance assumes an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 22.5% in 2019. Overall, our capital spending in 2019 is expected to be approximately $775 million to $825 million as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives and general business needs to drive and support future growth. In terms of cash distribution to shareholders, yesterday our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share, which is an increase of approximately 10% compared to the fourth quarter 2018 dividend. In fiscal 2019, we plan to repurchase approximately $1 billion of our common stock. We are pleased with our strong position as we enter the year and we are very excited for our plans for 2019. And as always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing in initiatives for long-term growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing operating priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. I'm proud of the team's execution that led to a strong result this year and feel confident that we're making the right investments and operating decisions that will allow us to extend our runway for profitable growth. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes providing you with an update on the progress we have made on our digital and non-consumable initiatives and outline 2 new transformational strategic initiatives that we are launching. Starting first with digital. In 2019, our digital strategy will remain focused on using technology that further enhance the in-store experience. We are confident that we can use technology to create a more personalized and convenient shopping experience for our customers. In 2018, we launched the DG GO! app, which allows customers to use their phones to scan items as they shop, see a running total of the items in their basket using our cart calculator and then skip the checkout line by using the DG GO! kiosk. The app has been popular with our customers, and through the end of fiscal 2018, we had more than 140,000 downloads and exited the year with approximately 25,000 monthly active users despite only having DG GO! kiosk in approximately 250 stores. Pending performance data, our goal in 2019 will be to expand this offering to more stores. We have engaged with our customers to understand how they are using the app to learn how we might improve it further. One key learning is that our customers are using the cart calculator frequently, even when they're not using DG GO! kiosk to check out. We believe they are using the cart calculator to stay within their budget and optimize their shopping dollars. Based on this, we recently launched cart calculator in approximately 200 stores. Throughout the first half of 2019, we intend to roll out this useful tool for our customers in the majority of our stores. We have invested in upgraded Wi-Fi to facilitate in-store use of this and other digital tools. Having a user-friendly and helpful suite of digital tools is becoming increasingly important to our customers and, therefore, to Dollar General. We know that our customers who more frequently engaged with our digital tools tend to shop with us more often and check out with larger average baskets. In fact, their baskets on average are about twice as large as those of nondigitally engaged shoppers. Currently, we have more than 15 million digital coupon subscriber accounts and more than 900 million digital coupons were clicked in 2018. Our goals in 2019 are to increase our subscriber base and perhaps, more importantly, their frequency of use. We want to make sure that users are engaged with our app more frequently to save time and money. This means that we will be launching digital marketing strategies focused on customer acquisition, retention and engagement. Our goal is to use personalization to drive both sales and gross margin benefit over time. Finally, as we continue to test and learn within our digital strategy, we plan to pilot buy online, pick up in store offering in the second half of fiscal 2019. We are in the early stages of many of these efforts within our digital strategy, and we are excited about the potential and the opportunities that lie ahead. Turning now to non-consumable initiatives or NCI. In 2018, we began our test of a bold, new and expanded assortment in key non-consumable categories of home, domestic, housewares, party and occasion. With the amount of space dedicated to non-consumables that remains the same, we believe this merchandise strategy will drive greater sell-through. The NCI offering was added to approximately 700 stores as of the end of 2018, and we plan to have it in approximately 2,400 stores by the end of 2019. It is important to note that while it is still relatively early, we have now worked through multiple replenishment cycles and we like the momentum the reset is generating. We are seeing improvements in traffic and sales as well as meaningful improvement in category mix and gross margin within these stores. We believe this offering will continue to generate excitement for our customers as it rolls out more broadly. Today I'm excited to introduce 2 new transformational initiatives that we are rolling out in 2019. The first initiative is one that we call DG Fresh. The DG Fresh initiative is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of perishable goods, primarily fresh and frozen. We believe this initiative will allow us to accomplish 3 key goals. First, it will allow us to reduce product costs, which can have a meaningful impact on our gross margin in the coming years. Second, it will facilitate higher in-stock levels of these goods, which should help to drive sales. And third, it will allow us to control our own destiny in fresh foods. Most notably by distributing perishables ourselves, we can carry more of the fresh products and brands our customers want. These include Better For You items and national brands. Today there are many items we cannot cost effectively procure through our current model. In addition, self-distribution will allow us to offer a wider selection of our own private brands to provide our customers with even more compelling value. Overall, we expect DG Fresh to allow us to do a better job of tailoring our product selection to fit the needs of our customers, particularly in rural areas. While our initial focus is on distributing the types of fresh and frozen products we already carry, this approach also provides a potential path forward to extending our produce offering to more of our stores in the future. We launched this initiative early in calendar year 2019, and we are currently distributing to approximately 300 stores in the Northeast from a new cold storage facility we own in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. By the end of this fiscal year, our goal is to be serving as many as 5,000 stores, from up to 4 new DG Fresh distribution facilities. Beyond 2019, our goal is to fully implement DG Fresh initiative chain-wide within 3 to 4 years at an annual rollout pace similar to what you see in 2019. As John mentioned, the start-up cost for DG Fresh will be a headwind to SG&A this year. However, we expect this initiative to be meaningfully accretive to sales and operating margin over time. The transition to self distribution has been relatively smooth, which is a testament to the strong relationships we have with our vendors, the support of our distributors and our proven ability to execute complex projects. We are excited about the potential for this initiative. The second new strategic initiative we're introducing today is Fast Track. Fast Track is a 2-pronged approach to increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. Driving our performance higher in these areas will be foundational to our ability to execute on our buy online, pick up in store pilot later this year. In addition, we believe that our successful Fast Track over the long term can create significant SG&A savings. The first key component of Fast Track involves streamlining the stocking process in our stores, which we call one-touch unloading. This new approach is designed to make stocking shelves simpler and faster, reducing the amount of labor needed to complete this task. It will begin with fundamental changes at the distribution centers, which will make processes even more store-friendly, with products and deliveries sorted by location within the store. Our focus is on reducing the amount of time spent stocking the shelves following a truck delivery, allowing us to get products on the shelves more quickly. We also believe we can reduce the amount of time that our store associates spend restocking shelves in between deliveries. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout option. This self checkout will allow customers to scan and pay for their items with little to no assistance needed from our associates. Dollar General is known for value and convenience, and our customers have told us that speed of checkout is vitally important to their in-store experience. Ultimately, Fast Track should help boost on-shelf availability and free up labor hours that we can dedicate to other in-store priorities such as customer experience. Our goal is to pilot Fast Track in several of our distribution centers and select stores during 2019. Following the pilot, we will determine the best plan for our broader rollout. Like the DG Fresh initiative, Fast Track will also have an upfront cost that will impact SG&A. At scale, however, we believe this initiative will be accretive to our SG&A profile and well worth the investment. These are just a few examples of how we continue to be an innovative leader in our channel. We are excited about these long-term strategic growth initiatives, which are fully aligned with our ongoing commitment to our 4 operating priorities. As you will recall, our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We have a robust pipeline of initiatives in place to drive growth in 2019. Our most impactful merchandising initiative continues to be our cooler door expansion. As we head into 2019, this remains a significant opportunity. Cooler doors are a great traffic driver and they allow us to offer even more of the products our customers want. In fiscal 2019, we plan to install more than 40,000 cooler doors across our store base. In 2018, we launched our Better For You initiative, which introduced healthier food options in more than 2,500 stores. This offering was in direct response to conversations with our customers who told us they wanted healthier options at affordable prices. We are pleased with the initial customer reception and the performance of this product set. We intend to offer the Better For You products in approximately 6,000 stores by the end of 2019.  Our new Good & Smart private brand has gained traction with our customers, and we are positioning it as a core product line in Better For You. In addition to Good & Smart launch in 2018, we had great success with the launch of Studio Selection, our aspirational health and beauty private brand. In 2019, we are planning a similar private brand launch in baby products. I'm also excited to announce that we'll be launching a new private brand in cosmetics in April. We remain dedicated to the beauty category at Dollar General, and we believe we can continue to take share from all classes of trade. As a premier private brand, it is an important part of our strategy. The new DG private brand will be called Believe and will include an inspiring lineup of attractively priced cosmetics that we think will be appealing to our customers. This cosmetic line is just one part of our ongoing efforts to capture share in the health and beauty category. From efforts focused on the growing bath and body segment to enhancing the shopping experience in this section of the store with more intuitive signings and product placement, we have a lot of opportunity to drive HBA sales. Across private brand, we continue to believe we can increase sales and penetration, which could have a meaningful impact on both gross margin and sales growth over the long term. In 2018, we conducted a holistic review of our private brand portfolio and are incorporating what we've learned into our 2019 go-to-market plan. In addition to sales-driving initiatives, we continue to pursue opportunities to enhance gross margin. In 2019, we intend to roll out Electronic Article Surveillance units to approximately 3,000 stores. We expect to complete this rollout by the end of the second quarter, bringing the total for the chain to approximately 13,000. Beyond this ongoing near-term opportunity, I'd like to give you a brief update on other longer-term gross margin opportunities. First, within distribution and transportation, we have continued to execute our strategy to reduce stem miles. I am proud to note that our distribution center in Longview, Texas, began shipping in January, and it is ramping up very quickly. And we expect our distribution center in Amsterdam, New York, to begin shipping later this year. As of the end of 2018, we have successfully expanded our private fleet to approximately 200 tractors, up from 80 at the end of 2017. In 2019, we plan to expand our private fleet further. While this fleet remains a small piece of our overall transportation needs, we believe it continues to provide strategic flexibility. Finally, foreign sourcing remains a long-term gross margin opportunity. We are specifically focused on diversifying country of origin as well as growing overall foreign sourcing penetration. We believe there are many countries around the world where we can source goods at even greater value for our customers. Our second operating priority is capturing growth opportunities. As we enter 2019, our proven high-return, low-risk model for real estate growth is a core strength of the business. We have a long-standing track record of successfully opening hundreds of stores every year that meet our strict returns thresholds. The flexibility of our model has allowed us to invest in new formats, store growth and a remodel program, all with strong returns that contribute significantly to our growth. Our store format innovation allows us to expand our addressable market opportunity as well. This innovation will continue to play a key role in 2019, as we plan to open 975 new stores to serve communities across the country. Our real estate model continues to focus on 5 metrics. These metrics help us determine that new store growth remains one of the best uses of our capital. We continue to see great results, with new store sales performing at nearly 100% of pro forma expectations and returns near the high end of our 20% to 22% goal. We are proud of our track record for executing successful real estate projects. In 2018, we completed a total of 2,065 real estate projects, 65 more than we had originally anticipated. For fiscal year 2019, we plan to remodel 1,000 mature stores and relocate 100 stores. We expect approximately 500 remodels to be in the Dollar General Traditional Plus, or DGTP, format. We also expect to add produce to approximately 200 stores, the majority of which will be DGTP remodels. As a reminder, our traditional remodel stores, which have approximately 22 cooler doors, deliver a 4% to 5% comp lift on average in year 1, and DGTP remodels with approximately 34 cooler doors delivers a 10% to 15% comp lift on average in year 1. DGTPs with produce are at the high end of this range. Over the past 2 years, we have conducted an exhaustive pilot of our DGX stores, and during that time, we have refined and enhanced the concept. We are now confident that we can drive profitability in this smaller box, and we plan to open approximately 10 DGX format stores this year. DGX stores are about half the size of a traditional Dollar General and have a product selection that is tailored to vertical living customers, particularly millennials. We are excited about these plans for continued growth and innovation in 2019. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending. This process has served us well, and the entire organization has embraced the cost control mindset. In our stores, we continue to manage expenses through the efforts such as optimizing product assortment, reducing operating complexity and reducing product movement within the stores. One of the reasons we are so excited about our Fast Track initiative is that we believe it has potential to be a significant and incremental driver of store-level efficiency. Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. Our ongoing dialogue with our employees is critical, and we learn from these conversations to reinforce our position as an employer of choice. In 2018, we greatly expanded our benefits to include those that resonate most with our employees, including paid parental leave for mothers and fathers, adoption assistance and day 1 access to healthcare benefits for store managers. We also launched new training programs, including a private fleet driver training program for distribution center employees to complement other existing educational benefits such as tuition assistance and college course credit for store manager training. And I am very proud to announce that for the eighth consecutive year, Dollar General was named to Training magazine's Top 125 Training List, ranking #1 overall on the most recent 2019 list. In 2019, we are expanding our benefits to include day 1 eligibility for telehealth benefits for all employees in our organization. Our part-time employees told us they need help accessing affordable healthcare, and we believe this will be a valuable benefit. We always monitor the wage environment carefully and believe we are well positioned across the organization, as illustrated by robust applicant flow at every level. Our investment in store manager wages and training continued to pay dividends in 2018, and we finished the year with our lowest store manager turnover rate on record. We are also doing very well at the store level, where we are seeing our time-to-fill open positions at all-time best levels for the company. We think our competitive compensation and benefit package is compelling, but we believe that the opportunity to build a long-term career with a growing retailer is the most important currency we have to attract and retain talent. In 2019, we plan to create approximately 8,000 net new jobs. This growth creates an environment where employees have opportunities to advance to higher paying and higher responsibility jobs in a relatively short amount of time. Being an employer of choice is a priority for us, and we will continue to seek out opportunities to enhance our employee experience. In closing, 2018 was a very good year for Dollar General. The business is in great shape as we enter 2019 and we are excited about the future. As John mentioned, our long-term goal generally remains to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth. To do this, we need to make smart business decisions that focus both on growing the top line and capturing incremental operating margin where and when we can. Today I have highlighted how our progress on our initiatives and operating priorities contributed to a great 2018. Looking ahead, we believe we are making the right long-term strategic investments from a position of strength. With our business model that leverages our real estate acumen, low-cost operating experience and our laser focus on delivering value and convenience to our customers, we believe that Dollar General's business is differentiated from the rest of the retail landscape. I believe we have the best team in consumable retail, and I hold each person on my senior team accountable for delivering today and planning for tomorrow's growth. I am confident that no one on the team will be satisfied with anything less. I am proud of the team's innovative approach to retailing, the strategic initiatives they have put forth in motion and the financial performance we are driving. We continue to be the leader within our channel. We believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail, and we have confidence that our strategy and execution will allow us to continue to reach our goals. Finally, our heartfelt thanks to each and every one of our more than 135,000 employees for the hard work that they do every day, which allows us to fulfill our mission of serving others. With that, operator, I'd now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : So I just wanted to go, of course, to the incremental investments on the initiatives this year. Obviously, still early stages around Fresh and whatnot. Can you just give us a little bit more of a sense for that $50 million specifically, like how much, at least directionally, of maybe a lift to comps do you think that could provide earlier on? And then how much of that may be recurring as you ramp some of these initiatives going forward? I guess, obviously, everyone kind of on the line today is just saying kind of, okay, a bit below the double-digit growth algorithm for this year. But when can that maybe return, if that's, of course, helpful context? John Garratt : Okay. A couple of questions there. I'll start with the first one around the initiatives. As you look at the initiatives, we said we see these as being accretive as early as next year. The 2 new ones we talked about are Fast Track and Fresh. We're very excited about both. As you look at Fresh, we see both of them helping the top line and the bottom line. As you look at Fresh, the immediate impact we see from that is helping our gross margin, helping reduce our product cost. Now that does come with upfront expenses, particularly in SG&A, and it's a trade-off for SG&A for gross margin. But we're very excited about what that can do not only to our cost, but then also our flexibility and longer term what that can mean in terms of as we expand our Fresh offering and in-stock availability there, we think that can be a meaningful sales driver. On Fast Track, that has 2 parts to that. You have the self-checkout piece and then you have the one-touch shelf stocking piece. The latter will have a more immediate impact, and we're starting to do that now, and we'll scale that over the course of the year. The self-checkout will take a little bit more time with the technology involved in driving the adoption on that, though. These are sizable investments this year that will pressure the SG&A. But as we look out, we see them as being accretive as early as next year, having a meaningful impact on our overall operating margin, EPS growth and really positioning us with the long term in mind to drive double-digit EPS growth over the long term. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. All right, perfect. that's helpful. And then if I could, last quarter you guys had mentioned, and we've been getting quite a bit of questions around it, just kind of your internal surveys. The confidence was looking a little bit shaky potentially for kind of later this year. It was nice to see, of course, in the release today that ticket and traffic were both positive. So any updates there? Any work, any thoughts around what you see in the basket around the health, that would be great? Todd Vasos : Yes, Vinnie. I would tell you, we talk to our core customer each and every quarter. And while she is feeling better about having a bit more money in her pocket, she continues to tell us that it is definitely from productivity, meaning working more hours and in some cases, multiple jobs. But what she is also telling us is that she is feeling a little less confident than she was at the middle of last year to the end of last year, which gives us a little bit of pause from the standpoint that we think that our core customers are starting to weaken a little bit, which obviously we do very well in all economic cycles. So we're positioning ourselves for the back half of the year for a little weaker consumer as we move through the year. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So maybe can you speak to the proactive promotional actions that you took in the fourth quarter? Any higher-level change within the competitive landscape that drove the change? And just how best to think about markdowns in gross margin in 2019? Todd Vasos : Yes, I'll start and then turn it over to John for '19. We really went after some targeted markdowns in Q4. As you know, Q4 has the highest traffic count across retail, not only at Dollar General. And we've got a track record here of working the price levers pretty well, and we know which ones to work for the stickiness of the customer, meaning we pulled some promotional levers in the fourth quarter that we believe will sustain that traffic growth into Q1 without having to be nearly as aggressive. And we thought -- we went at it from a position of strength, and we saw a real opportunity to take share as we went through Q4. It did exactly what we thought it would do and positions us very well going into the first quarter here in 2019. John Garratt : And as Todd said, with this helping drive traffic and taking share and our belief that we can retain these customers, we believe we're very well positioned going into 2019 to further optimize our promotional activity while at the same time driving profitable sales and traffic. So we feel we're very well positioned. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow-up on same-store sales. So how best to think about the cadence this year relative to the 2.5% for the year? It sounds like we should anticipate the first half better than the back half just given what you've seen in your surveys. But have you seen the momentum continue in the first quarter despite tax refunds and some pressures that others have cited? John Garratt : Yes. I'll start by saying the fundamentals are very strong. We're really pleased with the impact that our initiatives are having and the share we're taking. There is a bit of a timing impact to start the year. We talked about the benefit from the acceleration of SNAP payment from early Q1 into late Q4. That did have a bit of an impact on the beginning of the quarter, not necessarily dollar-for-dollar. But I would draw that timing to your attention. Other than that, it's a pretty smooth year in our mind and yes, I think we're firing at all cylinders. Operator : The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Just going back to your commentary in the press release, just about generally double-digit EPS growth going forward. Is that more of a reflection that this year it's going to be below 10% and you expect to get back to it potentially next year and beyond? Or is there something the changes your confidence in that metric? John Garratt : No, the comment we made there, and I'll start by saying we continue to see ourselves as double-digit EPS growers over the long term. That comment just meant to say that we reserve the right in some years to make targeted investments to drive that long-term growth and protect that 10% growth. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then just on gross margins, I appreciate the color that you provided on Q1. It sounds like we should expect as comparisons get easier that, that decline versus what we see in Q1 should progress to get better as the year progresses. Is that the right way to think about the cadence? John Garratt : Yes, I think you're thinking about that the right way. We talked about a couple of pressures at the beginning of the year. One thing we talked about is changes to inventory replenishment. We've seen a very high correlation between on-shelf availability and sales. And as such, we're making an investment at the beginning in the year bringing more inventory in to make sure we're right in stock. This will have a Q1 price tag due to the impact on product mix, but as we cycle through that, that will normalize. The other thing is as the year progresses, we expect to start to see some benefits from the initiatives we're putting in place like Fresh and others to enhance gross margins. So as you look at the year on a year-over-year comparison, we expect that to improve as the year progresses. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : So if you're successful with some of the initiatives that you're rolling out this year, should we expect you to accelerate rollout of them next year such that 2020 would be another year of sub-10% EPS growth? Todd Vasos : Michael, thanks for the question. As you know, here at Dollar General, we do everything very methodically, and we make sure that it has a solid return before we move to a broad scale rollout. In saying that, we really like what we see from DG Fresh early on, and we have great confidence in our Fast Track momentum as well, especially around some of the digital efforts that we have to include the self-checkout option that will be coming. In saying that, as John indicated, we believe that these initiatives will become accretive as we move into next year, so it should help offset some of those pressures as we continue a broader scale rollout. A little bit of a pay as you go, if you will, type of a rollout schedule. Michael Lasser : So just to clarify, you're looking at 2019 as more of a transitional year into the algorithm over the longer run into next year? John Garratt : As we indicated, there are start-up costs associated with this. As we start to scale these, as Todd said, it's more of it pays for itself as it goes, and we expect this to be accretive as early as 2020. Michael Lasser : Okay. And then could you break down the gross margin from the fourth quarter in a bit more detail? You outlined the promotions. What piece of the gross margin drag was that? And then initial markups are now a drag on gross margin. How did that look? John Garratt : Yes, walking through the last year, we articulated the specific Q4 drivers. So I guess, stepping back and taking a broader look, if you look at the full year, our gross margin was down 32 basis points. But we're very pleased with the results where we drove traffic, we took share, delivered very good comps. We did invest some margins opportunistically in promotional activity, as Todd mentioned, but it's clearly resonating with our customers. It allowed us to take share that was a very high take rate here, and helped us deliver the sales. And we believe that this will stick and we'll be in a position next year to rationalize these investments. The other impact was the SNAP. While that did benefit our sales with that pull forward, there was a mix impact that came with that, in general, lower mix of those additional sales. And then the team managed through the headwinds of tariff and transportation costs. As we go into this year, as we said, we believe we're very well positioned that we could throttle back to be even more targeted in our promotional activity while still driving traffic and sales. We believe we have opportunities to increase margin over time with the new initiatives, like DG Fresh and the NCI initiative, shrink, where we had 9 quarters of year-over-year improvement, and the other lever that we talked about. We think we're very well positioned. Operator : The next question will come from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : I'd like to dig into the comps that you're getting from new stores and from remodels. Historically, that's been in the range of 1.5% to 2%. But the thing we're seeing with the DGTP acceleration and some of the Fresh initiatives, it seems like there's an accelerated lift. I'm curious if you're starting to move to the high end of that 1.5% to 2% range or you're potentially above it, sort of a structural impact to your comp? Todd Vasos : Yes, thanks for the question. I would tell you that we're very happy with not only our new store pipeline, but our remodel relocation pipeline as well, and I think you're thinking of it right in that because of the ramp-up of our remodels, especially in the DGTP format to include produce in many of those stores, we're closer to the high end. I wouldn't say that we have broken out of that at the range that we talked about, but we're more at the high end of that range with some of the work that we've done. Peter Keith : Okay. I did want to dig into a little bit on how you're talking about the accretion benefits in 2020 from the growth initiatives. I guess, in reality when you look back at the last 3 years, and I have guidance for 2016, you really haven't been at 10% earnings growth in any of the years, if you exclude the tax changes. So do you think you will be at 10%-plus by 2020 and that the overall initiatives as a whole will be accretive to next year? John Garratt : Yes. Just to reiterate that over the long term, we see ourselves as double-digit EPS growers. We're not able to give specific guidance at 2020 at this point, but we do feel very good about the initiatives and their ability to be accretive next year. As you look at the fundamentals of the business model, we feel very good about what we're seeing from our new store growth, with the great returns on the sales from those, with what we're seeing on a comp basis with the performance of the initiatives and the comps we're seeing. We see, as we said, a lot of opportunities over the long term to improve our operating margin. We really look at operating margin overall. And we believe we're making the right investments here to enhance that operating margin. It comes at a little bit of a cost now, but we believe this positions us better for the future. And we continue to generate a tremendous amount of cash, which allows us to reinvest in this business while paying back a significant amount to shareholders through share repurchases. So we don't see the future differently. Operator : The next question is from Ed Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : I just want to start with a clarification. When you talked about the impact of SNAP in February not having the same dollar-for-dollar impact, are you saying that the headwind in February was not as big as the benefit that you saw in January? Todd Vasos : No, that's exactly what we're saying. We have not seen a dollar-for-dollar impact. I think that really goes to what I talked about earlier, some of those investments we made in markdown being very sticky. And we know our customer very well, and when you get to change her shopping patterns, she sticks with that. And we saw that as we moved into Q1. Edward Kelly : And then just curious as to, I know you only have a couple of weeks, but how March has looked given that things kind of normalized there. Refund seems to be picking up. And then just one other question about all this. Did you mention that there was some conservatism built into the comp guidance around the back half of the year? I'm not sure if I heard that right. Todd Vasos : I'll take the first one, but we really aren't talking really much about Q1 right now, obviously. But I would frame it this way. We feel very confident in our top line sales due to all of the initiatives that we have in place, including the investment we made in Q4. And just keep in mind, March has an Easter shift in it. I think that's important towards the end of the month. But for us, we'll equalize as we move through April. So we're bullish about the quarter, but we have a lot of quarter left to go. And John, you may want to address the other one. John Garratt : Yes. As to the timing impact we mentioned, the overall year comp that we guided to reflects our current views of the year. Edward Kelly : Okay. And then I had just one quick follow-up for you. On DG Fresh, why now on self-distribution? Can you just help us understand the benefits? What type of margin opportunities here from doing this yourself? Can your stocks improve with more frequent deliveries? And what it tells about your plans for Fresh? Todd Vasos : Yes. So why now? I think the best way to answer that is that we continue to expand our cooler program here. It's been one of the biggest traffic drivers and one of our biggest comp drivers that we've seen. We have a series of distributors out there today across the country, and those distributors do a nice job for us. But it comes at a cost, and that cost is very high, as you can imagine. In many cases, it's a full-service program. So we see a real opportunity from a position of strength right now to take that in-house and control your own destiny. And the way we see sales and margin enhancement here is a couple of ways. Number one, on margin, not having to pay that very hefty upcharge. We're going to build a bank, the majority of that with the little labor that we're putting into the stores to help work the goods, again coming off of the full-service program. But margins will be very accretive with this program. And then the second thing is sales. What you're going to see is our ability, one, to stay in stock; number two, longer term what you're going to find from us, as I mentioned, in my prepared remarks, is going to be a different assortment that's going to really take into account a lot of our private brand offerings, which will help our margins and our sales. But also on items that we don't carry today because of the distributor network that we have. So we're very excited about this. This is probably one of the biggest margin opportunities we'll have shorter term to really move the needle here. Operator : The next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : I guess I'm still a little confused on some of the markdown commentary. I know you guys have talked about the pricing environment being pretty benign, and you're comfortable with where your pricing is. So can you help us understand a little bit better why you engage in that promotional activity that you did, number one? And number two, how does it benefit 1Q even as you pull back promotions? I guess, I'm a little confused on that. Todd Vasos : Yes, sure. So the way we look at customer and customer traffic again, as I have mentioned, we talk to our customer every quarter. What she was telling us is that she was feeling a little weaker than she was middle of the year, and we took an opportunity from a position of strength to take share. We saw where we could take share in many different [ DMAs ] across the country. And we thought the best way to do that, which turned out to work pretty nicely, was to do it on a promotional basis because we feel very confident in our everyday shelf pricing that we have today. And so we did it on a promotional basis. And we know this customer very well. We know if we could change her shopping patterns, especially in the busy fourth quarter where we have her attention, she is very sticky. She'll stay with us. And I think we've seen some of that as we entered Q1, evidenced by the [ knock ] per dollar to dollar trade-off back on SNAP as an example. So we believe that it did exactly what we thought. And we've said in the past, we reserve the right to go in and make these investments periodically to continue to drive traffic and continue to take share, and that's exactly what we did in Q4. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. That's helpful. And then just curious, was traffic positive kind of throughout the quarter? Todd Vasos : Yes, it was pretty stable throughout the quarter. The back half, a little stronger than the first. But I would tell you, we are pleased overall with the traffic in Q4. Operator : The final question will come from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Robert Ohmes : Todd, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the long-term profit outlook of DG Fresh. So can you just sort of create a picture for us? If you do roll this out over the next 3 to 4 years, how does the income statement change? Are you expecting sort of a secularly higher gross margin and a kind of permanently higher expense ratio? And what are the kind of long-term assumptions about what store sales productivity levels have to be to make this all work on a large-scale basis? And you've mentioned some -- how you're taking more of your distribution in-house a little bit. I mean, does that have to accelerate more significantly to support doing fresh on a very large-scale basis? Maybe just help us understand the 3- to 5-year outlook for how much this could change your entire store base. It's probably more complicated to operate this category as well. Todd Vasos : Yes, that's a great question. And I would first start by saying that as we look at the DG Fresh initiative, we see a real opportunity to driving both the top line and the margin. So I would look at it this way. It will be a significant margin driver as we move into 2020 and beyond, and that's really driven primarily off of the distributor cost that we pay today, which has a substantial upcharge attached to it, substantial. And as we work with our vendors, which we've got relationships with all of them, what we're finding in the first 300 stores and the first DC that we put in were substantial reductions in cost of goods to move the product into our own DC and distribute it ourself. So I think you would need to look at it that way. On the top line, I think it will be a meaningful top line contributor as well as we continue to be better in stock because we know how to distribute goods. Fresh, shelf-stable, whatever it may be, controlling our own destiny there gives us high confidence that we can execute at a much higher level than we were seeing across the country. We have some distribution voids, quite frankly, across the country, and we still do with our distributor network because it is so complex and so large. By taking it in-house, we believe it will simplify our network and be able to execute that much better. And as you continue to look out, we see opening these DCs about the same pace as 2019, so an average of 5,000 to 6,000 stores a year for the foreseeable future until we're built out. And we believe that these fresh distribution centers, we will be able to leverage as well some of our dry goods that perhaps we can deliver out of there as well, taking some of the pressure off of our larger DCs. So we believe it's a win-win across the board, which should see substantial P&L ramifications on the positive side as we move into 2020 and then beyond.

Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call unless required by law. [Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Jennifer, and welcome to everyone joining our call. 2019 is off to a great start, and our strong financial performance illustrates the progress we have already made against our goals for this year. This performance was driven by our innovative merchandising and marketing strategies as well as our focus on operational excellence. We delivered value and convenience across our footprint of more than 15,000 stores. And we believe our neighborhood store concept continues to resonate with our customers. As most of you know, we have a lot of exciting things happening at Dollar General, and I'm looking forward to updating you on our progress during today's call.  I'll start with a few key highlights from our first quarter before turning the call over to John for a more in-depth look at our financial results. After that, I'll walk you through the progress we're making on our 4 strategic initiatives. And finally, I'll highlight the continued momentum our 4 operating priorities are generating for the business.  Turning now to our first quarter performance. We delivered comp sales growth of 3.8%. Additionally, net sales grew 8.3% to $6.6 billion compared to net sales of $6.1 billion in the first quarter of 2018. This strong net sales performance in the first quarter of 2019 showed, once again, that we can continue to drive sales growth from both new stores and mature stores. Additionally, during the first quarter, we continue to gain market share in highly consumable product sales, which was a key driver of our strong and balanced performance. Syndicated data indicated we had mid- to high single-digit growth in both units and dollars over the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending May 4, 2019. Our 3.8% comp growth rate for the first quarter of 2019 resulted from both an increase in average basket size as well as our highest customer traffic growth in over a year. Driving profitable traffic to our stores remains a priority, and we're pleased to see our efforts delivering during the quarter.  We saw another very strong quarter of growth in sales of consumables. Our nonconsumable sales growth was driven by strong results in both seasonal and home.  As part of our ongoing merchandising strategy, we continue to reduce space for hanging apparel in order to reallocate square footage to categories that our customers are shopping most in our stores. As expected, by intentionally downsizing our apparel offering, we saw a negative overall comp in apparel. That said, we believe we are executing the right back-to-basics apparel strategy, and we are reallocating the square footage to highly productive items that our customers are seeking.  As we noted in our last call, we believe sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 benefited from the acceleration of certain SNAP payments from February to January. Although the shift in these payments created a sales headwind for Q1, I'm pleased to note that we only gave back approximately half of the benefit we saw in the fourth quarter. We attribute this result to our strategic promotional activity in the fourth quarter, which we believe drove loyalty and share gains among existing and new customers as we intended. Even as we continue to gain share, we believe there is significant opportunity for us to take even more share. We will continue to keep the customer at the center of everything we do, and we're excited about the many opportunities we have to become an even more important partner to her as we move through 2019 and beyond.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to John to provide you with a little bit more detail on the first quarter financial results. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to walk you through the financial details of the first quarter. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year.  As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.2% in the first quarter, a decrease of 23 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increases in distribution and transportation costs; a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category, which generally has a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories; and sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category. Partially offsetting these items were higher initial markups on inventory purchases. As we said we would, we normalized our promotional markdown activity in the first quarter, following targeted increases at the end of fiscal 2018.  SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.5%, an increase of 6 basis points. The increase was primarily driven by increased employee benefits and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales, partially offset by lower repairs and maintenance and workers' compensation expenses.  As we noted on our fourth quarter call, we are investing this year in our 4 strategic initiatives. We remain excited about the long-term transformative potential of these initiatives and believe we are making the right upfront investments in 2019 to deliver mid- to long-term benefit. Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8% and compares to 21.6% last year. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter increased 8.8% to $1.48. The team did a nice job delivering the bottom line in the quarter despite headwinds from the investments and initiatives and the change we made to our inventory replenishment process.  Turning now to our balance sheet, which remained strong. Merchandise inventories were $4.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 14.3% overall and an increase of 8.2% on a per store basis. As we have previously discussed, we began implementing a change to our inventory replenishment process in the first quarter that we believe will allow us to support even higher levels of on-shelf availability. As anticipated, in addition to the gross margin headwind impact in the quarter, the change also contributed to our slightly higher overall inventory levels.  In addition to our inventory replenishment efforts, we are implementing more rigorous on-shelf availability processes. These processes are focused on improving the in-stock performance of stores that do not meet our standards. In the first quarter, we saw a 26% in-stock improvement in the below-standard stores. We know on-shelf availability is a critical component of the overall customer satisfaction and convenience and ultimately, sales. We believe that we can continue to drive improvements in this area. We continue to believe our inventory is in great shape and that these tactics position us to support and drive sales growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond. Our goal over time remains to have our inventory growth be in line with or below our sales growth. The business continues to generate significant cash flow from operations, totaling $574 million in the first quarter, an increase of $25.5 million or 4.7%. Total capital expenditures for the first quarter were $145 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations continued investments in construction of our Amsterdam, New York distribution center and spending related to the strategic initiatives.  During the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $200 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $83 million. At the end of the first quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $1.1 billion.  Our capital allocation priorities have served us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA.  I want to touch upon our fiscal 2019 financial guidance. As most of you know, tariff rates recently increased from 10% to 25% on certain goods from China. As we've discussed with you on previous calls, we have been executing on a variety of efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our business. Our efforts have focused on 4 key areas : continual negotiations with our vendors, product substitution, product reengineering and country of origin diversification. We will do everything we can to minimize the impact of tariffs on our customers. But even with these efforts, we believe our shoppers will be facing higher prices as 2019 progresses. Our focus remains on maintaining our everyday low price leadership, which is a key pillar of our value proposition.  Even though the outlook for additional tariffs appear to be more positive as we enter 2019, our focus on these efforts never waned. As a result of this work and our strong start to fiscal 2019, we believe we can deliver on our current 2019 guidance. With this in mind, we are reiterating the 2019 guidance announced on March 14, 2019. Our guidance does not contemplate the impact of any additional increases in tariff rates or the expansion of additional products subject to tariffs beyond those currently in effect.  I also want to provide you with some updated color on some of our expectations. We have noted that we are seeing a more balanced transportation marketplace, which has helped alleviate some of the pressure we saw on the back half of 2018. However, fuel costs have risen more than initially forecast, and we anticipate these costs could be a gross margin headwind throughout 2019. Despite transportation and tariff headwinds, we continue to believe that we should see improvement in the gross margin year-over-year comparison as we move throughout the year. Regarding SG&A, we continue to expect to spend approximately $50 million on our strategic initiatives in 2019.  While we expect these expenses to sequentially increase throughout the remainder of the year, we anticipate that the overall impact of these investments will most significantly pressure operating profit in the second quarter. As anticipated, the change we made to our inventory replenishment process resulted in a higher inventory level at the end of the first quarter, and we expect to see somewhat elevated levels throughout 2019. We are very pleased with our strong first quarter and are proud of the team's execution. We believe our guidance reflects the strong start to the year while contemplating known headwinds as well as the fact that there is still a lot of the year left ahead of us. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing in initiatives for long-term growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing operating priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.  With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. We're very pleased with the first quarter results and the strong start to 2019. We have an innovative, robust portfolio of initiatives that are beginning to gain momentum and want to take the next few minutes to update you on the progress we made this past quarter.  Starting with our nonconsumable initiative or NCI. As a reminder, NCI is our early-stage initiative focused on a new expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories of home, domestics, housewares, party and occasion. The NCI offering was available at more than 1,100 stores at the end of the first quarter, and we plan to include it in approximately 2,400 stores by the end of 2019. We have learned a lot from these stores, and we are already applying the lessons learned from successes in many nonconsumable departments across the chain. We're very excited about the results we're seeing from these stores and have now moved through many replenishment cycles. We are seeing lifts in nonconsumable sales particularly within seasonal and home but also delighted to be seeing a positive halo effect in consumable sales. Additionally, while it's still early, we're seeing a positive impact on customer traffic in these stores. As a result, we are driving higher sales and seeing improvements in both mix and gross margin in these stores.  Next, I want to update you on DG Fresh, which is one of the newest strategic initiatives we introduced in our Q4 call in March. As a reminder, DG Fresh is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods such as dairy and deli. We began shipping from our first DG Fresh facility in Pottsville, Pennsylvania in January, and we are serving more than 800 stores in the Northeast. While it's still early, we're already successfully reducing product costs on these types of items. We believe that [ if ] we continue to scale DG Fresh, it will be -- meaningfully improve our gross margins. Two other important goals for DG Fresh are to drive higher on-time delivery and in stocks, and we're encouraged by the early results, which are in line with our projections.  In addition to the gross margin and in-stock benefits, DG Fresh will eventually allow us to control our own destiny in these categories. This will include a wider selection of both national and fiber brands that our customers seek as well as enhanced offering of Better For You items. While produce is not included in the initial rollout, we believe DG Fresh could provide a path forward to expanding our produce offering to more stores in the future. We have signed leases on 3 more DG Fresh facilities that we intend to open in 2019. We plan to begin shipping from our second facility in Clayton, North Carolina within the next few weeks.  For fiscal 2019, our goal remains to roll out our self-distribution model to as many as 5,000 stores from up to 4 facilities. We're excited about DG Fresh and the many benefits it can deliver for our customer and our business, and we believe it can be accretive as early as 2020.  Turning now to digital. During the first quarter, the team continued to make great strides in deploying technology to further enhance the in-store experience. One great example of this work is our launch of the all-new Dollar General app, which redesigns the coupon clipping experience for our customer, removing friction in the clipping process in several ways. Our customers can now search for coupons by product category, type or name, and they can also use the app to scan a product and search for any available coupon. In addition, we've introduced new features that help integrate our digital and traditional media, including an interactive circular. We are very excited with the early feedback. Our digital coupons continue to grow in popularity with our customers, and we now have approximately 17 million digital coupon subscriber accounts, and more than 300 million digital coupons were clipped in the first quarter.  We also continue to innovate within the DG GO! app. As a reminder, this app allows customers to use their phones to scan items as they shop, see a running total of items in their basket using our cart calculator and then skip the line by using the DG GO! checkout. Through the end of the first quarter, we have had more than 200,000 downloads of DG GO! and are averaging more than 40,000 monthly active users. We have DG GO! checkouts in approximately 250 stores and our goal is to have DG GO! in approximately 750 stores by the end of the fiscal year. We have previously noted that our customers are using the cart calculator functionality frequently as a budgeting and optimization tool even when they are not using DG GO! to check out. Based on this insight, we intend to make cart calculator available in more than 12,000 stores by the end of the fiscal year.  As we move through 2019, we will continue to focus our efforts on developing new tools to enhance the value and convenience proposition for our customers. For example, we're working on consolidating our DG GO! and Dollar General coupon apps into 1 easy-to-use, customer-friendly app. Additionally, we're identifying opportunities to harness the power of the data we have available to us and how we use that data to increase our ability to personalize the shopping experience for our customers. We will continue to evolve our digital suite of tools to serve not only the customers we have today but also the customers of the future. Our digital strategy is an important component of our long-term growth strategy, and we're excited about the many opportunities ahead.  Our fourth strategic initiative is Fast Track. Fast Track is a two-pronged approach to increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. There are 2 key components to Fast Track. First, we are streamlining the stocking process in our stores. This starts with an update of sorting processes at our distribution centers that is facilitating our ability to optimize the way we pack our rolltainers. Our goal is to reduce the number of steps required to get product from truck to our store shelves. To help you visualize this, our goal is that each rolltainer only contain products for 1 or 2 adjacent aisles. While this may sound simple, the improved efficiencies from this change are expected to save a significant amount of store labor that can be redeployed to other customer-facing activities or channeled into labor productivity gains. Our goal is to complete the re-sorting process in all existing traditional distribution centers by the end of 2020.  As part of our streamlined stocking process, we will also look to incorporate more shelf-ready packaging. While this will take a little bit more time to achieve, we believe we can reduce the number of case packs that must be broken apart and thus, reduce the amount of time spent restocking shelves between deliveries and/or reduce the number of items mischaracterized as an out of stock. This should have a positive impact to us on on-shelf availability as items that may appear to be out of stock that are actually either on our sky shelves or in our backroom.  The second key component of Fast Track is a self-checkout test, which will allow customers to scan and pay for their items with little to no assistance from our associates. We believe this checkout option can further improve speed of checkout for our customers and reduce the number of labor hours devoted to checking out our customers. Our goal is to begin the self-checkout pilot in select stores later in 2019.  As John mentioned, while there'll be a significant SG&A price tag for our Fast Track in 2019, an upfront one, we believe that it can enhance customer convenience and also drive SG&A expense over time.  We believe we are the innovator -- innovative leader in our channel, and we are excited about our long-term strategic initiatives. We remain committed to our 4 operating priorities, and I want to take our last few minutes to update you on some of the recent efforts. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. Cooler door expansion continues to be the most impactful merchandising initiative. We began our cooler expansion efforts in earnest in 2013. In addition to being a great traffic and ticket driver, our success in expanding our cooler footprint has provided the scale necessary to initiate DG Fresh. In the first quarter, we added more than 12,000 cooler doors across the chain. We also increased the number of stores with our Better For You offering in the first quarter, bringing the total for the chain to approximately 3,400 stores. Our new Good & Smart private brand continues to be popular with our customers, and it remains an important part of our Better For You offering.  We have many ongoing efforts in the health and beauty area in 2019. Most recently, we launched Believe, our private cosmetic brand with all items priced at $5 or less. We have seen great initial customer response to this aspirational brand, and we are excited for more of our customers to try these goods over time. The final merchandising initiative I want to highlight today is the partnership with Western Union as we announced in the first quarter. This is a great opportunity to leverage our real estate footprint to offer our customers the ability to send or receive cash in more than 15,000 convenient locations. This agreement creates value for Dollar General in 2 key ways : first, we receive a commission for each transaction; and second, by delivering a new service that our customers want, we believe that it can become a traffic driver over time. As you hear from us frequently, the customer is at the center of everything we do. And this new service is another great example of offering her solutions she wants. Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, we are continuing efforts to capture several gross margin opportunities. In addition to the gross margin benefits of NCI and DG Fresh, reducing shrink remains an important opportunity for us. We rolled out nearly 900 more Electronic Article Surveillance units in the first quarter, bringing the total number of stores with EAS to approximately 11,000. Our goal remains to have EAS in approximately 13,000 stores by the end of the year.  We also continue to pursue distribution and transportation efficiencies to support our profitable sales growth. As John noted, we are seeing some continued inflation in 2019 in transportation costs primarily from fuel rates, which further emphasizes the importance of these efforts. For example, we continue to make progress in reducing stem miles, and our Longview distribution center has ramped up nicely since we began shipping in January. And we intend to begin shipping from our distribution center in Amsterdam, New York later this year. We're also further expanding our private fleet and intend to grow it by at least another 75 tractors by the end of fiscal 2019. This year's private fleet expansion will be largely focused on our DG Fresh facilities, and we believe it remains an important part of our overall transportation strategy. Finally, foreign sourcing remains a long-term gross margin opportunity, and our goals include increasing penetration as well as diversifying countries from which we source. The team is successfully finding products in key categories that can be sourced internationally, and we believe there are many additional products and channels to explore.  Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven, high-return, low-risk model for real estate growth remains a core strength for our business. Our real estate model continues to focus on the 5 metrics that have served us well in evaluating thousands of new stores in recent years. These metrics include : new store productivity, actual sales performance, average returns, cannibalization and the payback period. Even as we see changes on the competitive landscape, our real estate projections continue to perform well against these metrics, reinforcing our belief that new store growth is the best use of our capital. Our remodel and relocation program is a great supplement to our new store growth strategy, and overall, we continue to see strong results from our portfolio of real estate projects.  We made tremendous progress toward achieving our real estate project goals in the first quarter. During the quarter, we opened 240 new stores; remodeled 330 stores, including 128 DGTP remodels; and relocated 27 stores. We also added produce to approximately 50 stores, bringing the total of stores across the chain offering produce to approximately 480. As a reminder, on average, our traditional remodeled stores, which have an average of 22 cooler doors, deliver a 4% to 5% comp lift. And a DGTP remodel, which has an average of 34 higher-capacity coolers, delivers a 10% to 15% comp lift, with the addition of produce driving comps to the high end of this range. We have a robust real estate pipeline in place, and we are excited about the continued growth ahead of us in 2019.  Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. The discipline with which the team approaches spending continues to be a great strength. Our clear and defined process to control expenses governs spending decisions and has resulted in a strong cost control mindset. We continue to focus efforts around the organization on reducing costs where possible through a zero-based budgeting process. While this operating philosophy is generally focused on cost reduction, it has also proven to be a great springboard for many of the ideas. In fact, this process was the foundation for both Fast Track and Western Union. And we believe it continues to serve us well as we reinforce our position as a low-cost operator.  Our fourth and final operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. We believe the opportunity to develop a career with a growing retailer is unique in many of the communities we call home, and we are proud of the thousands of associates who have taken advantage of this opportunity. More than 11,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes, and we continue to champion strong development and training programs for our associates to grow.  On the supply chain side, our first class of employees has completed the private fleet driving training program. This program pays for distribution center associates to obtain their commercial driver's licenses and furthers their careers. We keep a close eye on key metrics related to our employee -- our people, and we are pleased with what we are seeing. We continue to have a robust applicant flow at every level. Additionally, while it's still early in the year, store manager turnover is trending better in 2019 than 2018, which was our best year on record. We are continually engaging with our entire employee base, and we believe this dialogue is vital to cultivating the strong Dollar General culture. Remaining an employer of choice is an important priority for us, and we believe that we are well positioned to continue to attract and retain talent.  In closing, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter and excited about our position and outlook for the remainder of 2019. As we said we would, we are driving growth on multiple fronts, and I'm delighted with the team's ability to deliver across so many complex projects simultaneously. Our real estate growth strategy is generating thousands of new store openings and remodels, and we have a portfolio of robust initiatives in place that we believe will have a meaningful, positive impact on our business for years to come. In short, we are using our mature and stable business as a foundation to drive innovation and growth. We believe we operate in the most attractive sector in retail, and we continue to differentiate the Dollar General business from the rest of the retail landscape through our distinct combination of value and convenience in a unique real estate footprint.  Our mission of serving others guides all we do at Dollar General, and the team remains focused on serving our customers every day while driving long-term value for our shareholders. I want to thank each of our more than 137,000 employees across the company for all of their hard work every day. I'm excited about what we can accomplish together in 2019.  With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Matt Boss from JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on a great quarter, guys. Todd Vasos : Thank you. John Garratt : Thank you. Matthew Boss : So Todd, maybe to start off. You outlined a laundry list of top line initiatives underway. I think you probably could have hosted an Analyst Day for how much is clearly going on. I guess maybe could you help segment opportunities you think contributed to your first quarter comp, what you're most excited about maybe into the back half of the year versus initiatives you see accelerating into next year and beyond? Todd Vasos : Sure. Our cooler program continues to be one of the key drivers, Matt, to what we've seen in our success so far in 2019 and also what we've seen in the past. But what I'm also excited about is what we're seeing in a lot of the initiatives that we continue to work on in our HBA world. As an example, the teams are doing a great job there, and the customer is really resonating to our great prices, our values as well as our extensive private brand and national brand offering in those areas. So they continue to do very well. And our new cosmetic line, Believe, I think will continue to build momentum as we move into the second quarter and back half of this year.  As you look at later parts of this year and into next, we believe that many of our initiatives, including NCI, will continue to build momentum. And also, our DG Fresh initiative, as I look at that over the long term later this year and into next, it's already starting to deliver the gross margin that we see through better cost of goods, but also, it's showing us that we can be better in stock by controlling our own destiny there. And so we believe that, that will start paying even more dividends as we move to the back half of the year. We're very bullish on what we see in our top line right now, and we'll continue to push as much as we can to continue to see these great results as we move through the back half of the year. Matthew Boss : Great. Maybe then just a follow-up. On the SG&A front, so excluding the incremental $50 million of initiative spend, any underlying change to the 2.5% to 3% comp of the expense leverage point? And Todd, I guess larger picture, is it fair to think about this year's strategic initiatives build as a peak level as you kind of look forward? Todd Vasos : Yes, I'll let John start, and I'll add a little cover. John Garratt : Yes. In terms of SG&A, we're pleased with the Q1 cost control. We deleveraged 6 basis points. As we'd mentioned, we're investing in initiatives for future growth. There was somewhat of a shift from Q1 to Q2 but very pleased with the cost control. In terms of the leverage point, as we discussed before, there is an impact as you're investing in things like DG Fresh, which we see as enhancing our operating margin over time, that does put pressure on SG&A as you're investing some labor in the stores and other initiatives like that. But I would say, we remain laser focused on cost control. We don't see it differently. And the main change here is that dynamic of investing in these strategic initiatives, which we see helping our operating margin and being as accretive as early next year. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael Lasser : Given the success you had in the first quarter, why should we expect at comp better than the 2% that's implied at the -- in your full year comp guidance of 2.5% over the next few quarters? Todd Vasos : Michael, this is Todd. When I look at the rest of the year, we do feel very good about where the comp is headed. We've got a lot of year ahead of us, right? And there's a -- could be a lot of noise out there. We don't know what these -- this last list of tariffs may or may not do to our core consumer and really, the consumer base in general. So I think we're -- our guidance reflects appropriately where the -- where we are today and where those risks still may lie. But we're doing everything we can to continue to drive that top line and of course, drive traffic. And our key here is traffic, and traffic is king. We know that, and we continue to -- all of our efforts around our sales are really guided by that traffic growth. Michael Lasser : And on the subject of tariffs, we know that 5% of your sales come from direct imports, with China being one of those countries. Do you have an overall estimate of your cost of goods exposure to China if the list 4 does go through? John Garratt : Yes. So as you indicated, it's about 6% of our purchases measured at cost are tied to direct imports predominantly China-centric, although we have been diversifying in recent years. This is an impact facing all of retail. Our exposure is relatively lower compared to many. And the team has been working very diligently to mitigate this impact as evidenced by the updated guidance or the guidance that we maintained. The team is working on continual negotiations with vendors, product substitutions, product reengineering and continuing to change the origin of countries where it's coming from. We're doing everything we can to minimize the impact on the customers. But as you know, and others have said, this is probably something that's going to impact the customers particularly if the list 4 comes out. I'd rather not speculate on what that impact will be. It's hard to say how that -- things will shake out there. But we believe that we're very well positioned to serve our customer as we're priced right, we're conveniently located and we're there to help her in good times and bad. Todd Vasos : And Mike, I'll just add as well. Remember, we're a limited source -- limited SKU retailer, meaning we don't have to carry everything. And we can make decisions on what to carry and what not to carry depending on cost of goods and what may or may not increase. And I think the team has done a real nice job in the first few lists. And while list 4 is very extensive, that work is ongoing right now as well. So stay tuned. We're hoping that there'll be some resolution here. But make no mistake that this will -- if list 4 goes in, will cost the consumer on [ during ] and with her budget. The great thing is, though, I believe that Dollar General stands ready to be able to serve that customer because she'll need us more at that time. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Karen Short : Just a very quick -- just a question in terms of having such a strong 1Q. Obviously, you indicated there will be more SG&A pressure in 2Q. But I guess, any thoughts on keeping kind of the full year overall guidance given that some of these costs abate in the second half and gross margin compares also get quite a bit easier? John Garratt : Yes. I'll start by saying we feel great about the fundamentals of business and the strong start to the year. As I did note, there was some investment spending shifted from Q1 to Q2, and importantly, we absorbed the impact of the recently enacted tariff increases not previously assumed into the guidance. And as Todd mentioned, there's still a lot of year left, perhaps the comp laps are a little tougher as the year goes on. But we feel great about the business. We feel comfortable about the guidance we've provided, and we're very pleased with the start of the year. Karen Short : Okay. And then just switching to comps for a second. On the NCI, maybe can you give a little bit of color on the comp lift that you're seeing in those stores and also the margin impact? And then, you made a comment on the 26% improvement, I guess, in in-stocks at the below-standard stores. Any color you can give us on the comp benefit from having the better in-stocks? Todd Vasos : Sure. On the NCI program, we're very pleased with the early results there. The team has done a really nice job in procuring goods. We're now into our fourth and fifth replenishment cycle, and some of the product that I've seen recently with this newest wave is even better than the previous one. So I could tell you that we feel very good with what we're seeing. We're seeing overall lifts in the store, both in our nonconsumable areas and our consumable areas. So we're getting a very nice halo effect out of that. And not only are we seeing those lifts in our top line sales, but we're seeing gross margin benefits, of course, in our nonconsumable area but overall as well for the entire box. So we're feeling very good about where we're going. We'll do up to 2,400 stores this year and looking to see how we accelerate that as we move into 2020 and beyond. But again, we feel very good.  Your second part of the question was on the in-stock piece. We've been working very hard, it started at the end of last year, in really looking at how we look at on-shelf availability. And very proud of what the team has done in and around making sure we have product on the shelf for our consumers. Now it did come with a little bit of a cost of some inventory. But as you alluded to, and we talked about in our prepared remarks, we're seeing in the 20% range increase of on-shelf availability, meaning in-stocks for our customer. And I can tell you that in those stores, it's meaningful, and it does add to the comp. So we'll continue to work that piece. And as I also talked about, as Fast Track continues to move forward, and this would probably be more into the late '19 and into 2020, we're going to be getting some on-shelf availability benefits from that as well as we continue to reduce those case packs and rationalize our SKU base on the shelf to better keep our in-stock levels on fast-movers. And stay tuned for more of that. We believe that will pay some real benefits as we move into the end of the year and into '20. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : The gross margin performance in 1Q was better than my forecast. Just curious how it stacked up to your expectations. And previously, you had mentioned that you expected the most pressure on a year-over-year basis in 1Q. Just want to make sure that guidance still stands and just give some overall puts and takes on GPM. John Garratt : Yes. We were pleased with the performance in Q1. We'd indicated that on our Q4 call that Q1 would be pressured. But we did say that we expected to see sequential improvement on a year-over-year basis as we went from Q4 to Q1. But nonetheless, we did see pressure from the change in the replenishment process as well as the ongoing pressure of distribution and transportation costs and the ongoing mix pressures. However, as we said we would, we were successful in normalizing the promotional markdown costs while, at the same time, delivering strong comps and traffic. So we're very pleased with that. The team did a great job managing through the various headwinds. And as we said in our prepared statements, we expect to see further sequential improvement over the balance of the year on a year-over-year comp basis. And longer term, we believe we have a lot of opportunities to increase not only gross margin but operating margin over time.  As Todd indicated, we're very excited about the progress we're making on DG Fresh as we convert items and convert stores. We're seeing the benefit to the cost savings we expected there. Very pleased with what we're seeing from NCI in terms of not only the sales lift but also the improvement that adds to mix. We're investing more in EAS units. We're going to be adding another 3,000 this year. We've seen great success from that and the benefit it has on shrink. And there continues to be opportunities for us with category management, increasing foreign sourcing penetration, increasing private-label penetration, and we mentioned the nonconsumable opportunity. And then lastly, while we did see pressure from transportation costs in Q1, and fuel remains a pressure, we're very pleased by what we've seen in terms of the proactive efforts of the team to mitigate these efforts and take advantage of an improving environment. So we're optimistic that over the long term, we can not only maintain but enhance overall operating margin over the long term, and that's the way we look at it. Paul Trussell : And just as a follow-up, Todd, could you maybe just speak bigger picture to what your core consumer is saying about their financial health and overall sentiment on the economy? And then maybe rank for us, as you look in your stores comp gains occurring from your core customer coming more frequently versus shopping the store more broadly versus actually getting that trade down from higher-income shoppers. Todd Vasos : Yes. Sure, Paul. Yes, when you look at our gains, our core consumer is continuing to tell us, \"I feel pressured.\" But again, this core consumer always is under pressure financially. Her income levels are on the lower end, as we all know. In saying that, she continues to tell us that she's back to work. She continues to tell us that she's got a little bit more money in her pocket, more so from productivity, meaning more -- working more hours than actual wage growth, but yet, more money. She has headwinds, make no bones about it. She still has headwinds of health care being one of the largest. Rents continue to be out there for her as a headwind. But as we looked into last year when we started to hear from our consumer that she was feeling a little bit more stressed, we continue to hear that. But what we do very well here is we -- we're able to move our promotional activity, our mix inside the store, our end-cap presentations to match where we believe she will be. And we did that in the first quarter and, I believe, very successfully. And we'll continue to do that as our customer tells us where she believes she'll be in her journey as we move through 2019. The -- as you look at our consumers overall, though, I would tell you that our consumer that makes a little bit more money, so that next level-up consumer, is our fastest-growing consumer that we have here at Dollar General. So that trade-in is alive and well. But it's not coming at any cost of our core consumer, and our core consumer continues to come more often as well as we're seeing that she's spending more once she's in the store. So we're both getting the transaction growth side and that basket size. So we feel very good about our customer segments and where they're headed. And the great thing is we're attracting a higher-end consumer, I believe, because of all the work that we've done in this box over the years. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Also congrats on a nice quarter. Todd Vasos : Thank you. Rupesh Parikh : So I had 2 questions on your DG Fresh efforts. So as I guess, first, anything that has surprised you, thus far? I know it's only been a few months at this point. And then, as you think longer term or even in the intermediate term, how do you think about what flows to the bottom line versus being reinvested in the business from some of the gross margin benefits that you expect to see? Todd Vasos : Yes. Right now, I would tell you that the DG Fresh initiative is really performing about where we thought it would perform. Again, our teams are very good at executing very complex projects. And this, as you could imagine, is one of the big ones. But I would tell you, opening 1,000 stores a year and remodeling another 1,000 is no easy feat. So we're very good at this type of work. And I would tell you that DG Fresh was no different. And it's executing as we thought and are producing the results that we thought. You heard from John. We're seeing the cost of goods savings. We're seeing better in-stocks already at store level, and we're only 800 stores in. And so more to come as we move through the next cycles of this. The great thing is the plan is rolling out as designed. We've already got all 4 of our DCs signed and ready to go. And the next one will be shipping here in the next few weeks. So we feel good about that.  And then, as you continue to look at DG Fresh on that margin rate, the great thing about Dollar General is we never took our eye off of price, whether that be in our fresh area or our dry areas of the company. And we're priced very, very well across the board. So I would tell you that we feel very good about that, and we feel very good about those margin gains that should come from this over time. Should -- the majority of it should drop to the bottom line, which is very exciting. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And 1 quick follow-up question. Weather clearly was a challenge last year. And I know it appeared also as a challenge in Q1. Just curious if you guys think it had a negative impact on your business. John Garratt : What I would say is there are a lot of puts and takes between weather laps, weather this year and the pull-forward of the SNAP benefit. When you net all that together, all that noise together, it's about a push. And really, the 3.8% comp was a solid 3.8% comp not impacted by any real outside noise. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba : So related question on comps. I mean in the first quarter, obviously, you had the pull-forward becoming the SNAP benefit, the 70 basis points. Sounds like you got half of that back. Tax refunds looked like were a little bit lower than people expected. And then weather was pretty bad. So putting that all together, what do you think allowed you to do close to a 4% comp with those 3 headwinds? Was it macro? Or was it more about the positive impact of the -- of a lot of initiatives that you're -- that you talked about on this call? Todd Vasos : Yes. I would tell you that our core consumer, again, is -- has a little bit more money in her pocket. But I would tell you when you look at the performance and as we see it broken down into categories that we watch very closely here, many of our gains occurred from the initiatives that either we worked through in 2018 that are continuing to still pay off and even some of those early 2019 ones. So it gives us a lot of confidence that we're on the right track and as we move through the rest of this year. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So I know a bunch of people have asked about kind of the comp momentum. But Todd, specifically, you talked about how last year, which -- where we generally saw rising average ticket but softer traffic, was due to the relative health of your core customer and trip consolidation. So I guess, what I'm kind of trying to figure out is what specifically changed this quarter. I mean, you had mentioned core expansion earlier in the call, but you've been expanding cooler doors for years. So I guess, what I'm trying to figure out specifically in 1Q maybe what changed on the traffic front. Todd Vasos : Yes. So I think the best way to look at this is 2 things. Number one, I mentioned earlier, this core customer started to signal middle of last year that she was feeling a little bit more pressured, not feeling as robust as she did. So I would tell you that this core consumer, her shopping patterns are -- and habits are changing a little bit, we're seeing it, and maybe moving more back to what we were used to seeing with maybe not quite as a fuller -- full basket and coming a little bit more often. Now 1 quarter doesn't make a year, so we're going to continue to watch what she does. But in Q1, we saw some start of that normalization back to where this core customer normally is resonating at.  The other thing that I would tell you in Q1 specifically is the actions we took in Q4 promotionally to really solidify that customer in Q4 did exactly what we thought and brought forward that customer in a very sticky manner, if you will, to Q1, and she spent accordingly. So we feel good about that initiative in Q4. It did exactly what we thought in Q1. And I believe that was a big piece of why we only gave back half of that SNAP benefit that we pushed into Q4 last year from that top line. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line -- our final question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Just wanted to ask another one about tariffs. It sounds like you did a lot of work there to mitigate that and do some substitutions. Just was wondering if you can help us understand how much price you expect to pass along. And maybe too early to tell from a competitive standpoint, but how do you think you performed on that mitigation strategy relative to competitors? And how much price do you think really we're going to see being passed through broadly? Todd Vasos : As you -- again, you take a look at Dollar General, and again, we've been, all along, many, many years now, we ensure that we have the right price for our consumer. We watch price very, very closely here. But the other thing to keep in mind about Dollar General, I mentioned earlier, is we don't have to carry everything. We're a limited SKU assorted retailer, and we can make decisions based on a lot of different factors to include price, meaning cost of goods. And we'll continue to do that as we move through these tariffs. I think our teams have done a great to date. But I would tell you, even through the first 3 lists if you will, we've seen in the marketplace the consumers paying a little bit more money across the board in the marketplace. And with list 4 looming out there, which is probably the big -- well, not probably, it is the biggest impacted list, I would have to assume the consumer is going to bear the brunt of some of this as well. And so we're doing everything we can here at Dollar General to make sure we soften that blow. But again, the great thing is this model works so well in good times and not-so-good times. And if this consumer is having to pay more across the board at every retailer because of these tariffs, we'll stand ready to build with open arms to take her in when she needs us most. And we're positioning ourselves for that as we move through 2019. Kelly Bania : Okay. And maybe just to follow up on the prior question about the stickiness and the promotional activity that you did last quarter. How do you expect that -- or do you expect that stickiness to continue to impact your consumer and the traffic patterns for the rest of the year? Todd Vasos : What we see normally is that, that stickiness does stay with us for a couple of quarters. So we believe that we'll still see some benefit from that as we move into Q2, may not be quite as much as Q1. But again, we feel very good about where we are and our start to the fiscal year. So we feel that, that customer resonates very well with price and value. We know that, and we continue to offer that. So even though that we've normalized the promotional activity, you've got to remember who Dollar General is. And that is everyday low price on the shelf that she can count on, and she sees that when she's in the store each and every day. So again, we feel very good about our competitiveness on price, and we feel good about our -- both traffic and ticket as we move into the second quarter and back half of this year. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Todd Vasos : Thank you very much, and we hope to talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Pia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, August 29, 2019. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning.  Now I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Donny Lau, Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development and the interim Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Lau, you may begin your conference. Donny Lau : Thank you, Pia, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and John Garratt, our CFO. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at investor.dollargeneral.com under News & Events.

Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which, as I mentioned, is posted on investor.dollargeneral.com under News & Events. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our second quarter results driven by strong performance on both the top and bottom lines. The quarter was highlighted by same-store sales growth of 4%, including an increase in average basket size and another quarter of meaningful traffic growth. Our results this quarter were fueled by solid execution across many fronts, including category management, merchandise innovation, store operations and continued progress with our strategic initiatives. In addition, we remain focused on disciplined cost control which resulted in another quarter of solid earnings growth. Notably, our second quarter comp performance represents an increase of 7.7% on a 2-year stack basis, which is the highest in 23 quarters and speaks to the underlying strength of the business. Given our first half performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2019. John will provide those details during his remark. In short, we are executing well against both our operating and strategic priorities and believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth as we move forward. Now let's recap some of the top line results for the second quarter. Net sales increased 4 point -- or 8.4%, excuse me, to $7.0 billion compared to net sales of $6.4 billion in the second quarter of 2018. We are particularly pleased with the continued strong performance of our new stores and sustained positive sales momentum in our mature store base. Once again, this quarter, our highly consumable market share trends in syndicated data continued to exhibit strength with mid- to high single-digit share growth in both units and dollars over the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending July 27, 2019. Our same-store sales increase during the quarter was driven by strong performance in both consumables and nonconsumables sales. Our nonconsumable sales growth was driven by positive results in seasonal and in home. These quarterly results further validate the belief that our focus on our operating priorities is working and that we are pursuing the right strategies to create meaningful long-term shareholder value. We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and are advancing our goal of further differentiating the Dollar General business from the rest of discount retail landscape.  Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to take the opportunity to congratulate Jeff Owen on his recent promotion to Chief Operating Officer. As was announced this morning, Jeff is assuming the responsibility for store operations, merchandising and supply chain. As a large and growing retailer, we believe this alignment further strengthens the company and positions us well for continued future growth. Jeff has served as our EVP of Store Operations since 2015. During his time in that role, Dollar General added more than 3,500 stores and increased sales by over 35%. Prior to serving as EVP, Jeff spent more than 20 years with this company in increasing roles of responsibility, beginning with us as a store manager and eventually rising to SVP of Store Operations. I'd also like to congratulate Steve Sunderland on his promotion to EVP of Store Operations, where he will oversee operations of our nearly 16,000 stores across the country. Steve joined Dollar General team in 2014 as SVP of Store Operations, where he has led approximately 8,000 stores and nearly 70,000 employees. Steve brings more than 30 years of retail operations experience to the role, and I know our teams value his leadership. I'm very proud of both Jeff and Steve and grateful for all they have done for this company. I am confident they are the right leaders for these positions, and I look forward to working with them in their new roles as we continue to drive long-term growth at Dollar General. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken us through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details of the second quarter. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.8% in the second quarter, an increase of 13 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales and higher initial markups on inventory purchases. These factors were partially offset by higher shrink, increased distribution costs, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category and sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category. We benefited this quarter from a reduction -- continued reduction in promotional markdown activity following targeted increase during the fourth quarter of 2018. We continue to believe these targeted actions drove loyalty and contributed to additional share gains as evidenced by our strong sales results during the first half of 2019. SG&A as a percent of sales was 22.5%, an increase of 32 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses of $31 million or 44 basis points in the quarter relating to significant legal matters. Excluding these Significant Legal Expenses, we leveraged SG&A expense with adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales of 22.1% or a decrease of 12 basis points. These results also reflect an increase in expenses for store supplies and were partially offset by lower utilities costs as a percent of sales and reductions in benefits costs and workers' compensation and general liability expenses. As previously discussed, we are investing in our 4 strategic initiatives this year. I'm pleased to report that we're making great progress on each, and we remain excited about the long-term transformative potential of these initiatives. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have invested $19 million in SG&A expense attributable to our strategic initiatives. We continue to believe these investments position us well to deliver meaningful benefits to the business over both the intermediate and longer term. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter increased 5.9% to $578 million compared to $545 million in the second quarter of 2018. Adjusted operating profit for the second quarter, which excludes the legal expenses I mentioned earlier, increased 11.6% to $609 million compared to $545 million in the prior year period. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% and compares to 21.5% in the second quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter increased 8.6% to $1.65. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter, which excludes the after-tax impact of the previously mentioned legal expenses, increased 14.5% to $1.74. Overall, we are pleased with the balanced performance the team delivered during the quarter, resulting in strong profit growth. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 13.4% overall and an increase of 7.5% on a per-store basis. As previously discussed, we implemented a change to our inventory replenishment process in the first quarter which is enabling us to support even higher levels of on-shelf availability. And while as anticipated, this change is resulting in higher inventory levels overall, we continue to believe this change better positions us to support and drive continued sales growth. In addition to our inventory replenishment efforts, we are implementing enhanced processes focused on improving the in-stock performance in stores that do not meet our standards. I'm pleased to report our efforts drove a 20% improvement in on-shelf availability in targeted stores during the quarter, and we believe we can continue to drive improvements in this area as we move ahead. Overall, we continue to believe our inventory is in great shape and remain focused over time on driving inventory growth that is in line with or below our sales growth.  Year-to-date through the second quarter, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $1.1 billion. Total capital expenditures through the first half of 2019 were $293 million and included planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, continued investments and construction of our Amsterdam, New York distribution center and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $185 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $82 million. At the end of the second quarter, the remaining repurchase authorization was $961 million. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. I'll close with an update on our annual guidance for fiscal year 2019. As you know, upon its effective date, the proposed List 4 tariff recently published by the U.S. Trade Representative will expand the list of products that are currently subject to tariffs at a now expected rate of 15%. In addition, tariff rates on Lists 1 through 3 are expected to increase to 30%, up from 25%, effective October 1. Over the past several quarters, our teams have been diligently working to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our business. As a reminder, our efforts are focused on 4 key areas : continual negotiations with our vendors, product substitutions, product reengineering and country of origin diversification. We intend to continue these efforts to do all we can to minimize the impact to our customers and remain focused on our everyday low-price strategy to provide our customers with the value they need and have come to expect from Dollar General. Now as you may recall, the anticipated impact of the May 10 tariff rate increase was included in our prior full year guidance, which we provided on May 30. Our updated guidance today reflects the anticipated impact of the expected tariff rate increase on Lists 1 through 3, the proposed List 4 tariffs and tariffs previously implemented. Despite these incremental headwinds, we are raising our full year financial guidance primarily as a result of our strong first half performance. For fiscal year 2019, we now expect net sales growth of approximately 8% and same-store sales growth to be in the low to mid-3% range. We are increasing our expectations for operating profit growth to approximately 5% to 7% and expect adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 6% to 8%. And we are raising our outlook for diluted earnings per share to the range of $6.36 to $6.51 or adjusted diluted EPS of $6.45 to $6.60. Our adjusted operating profit growth and adjusted diluted EPS guidance exclude the impact of legal expenses I noted earlier. Both our GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance assumes an estimated effective annual tax rate of approximately 22% to 22.5%. Finally, our fiscal year 2019 outlook for real estate projects, capital spending and share repurchases remains unchanged. Let me now provide some additional context on our current expectations. First, our guidance does not contemplate additional tariff increases in tariff rates or the expansion of products subject to tariffs beyond those which are either currently in effect, included in the List 4 proposal or incorporated in the expected 5% tariff rate increase on Lists 1 through 3. Additionally, it does not reflect any tariff-related impacts to broader consumer spending. With regards to gross margin, we now expect our rate improvement for the second half to be roughly in line with Q2 when compared on a year-over-year basis. Relative to our previous expectation of quarterly improvements in the gross margin rate year-over-year comparison throughout the year, our revised outlook is primarily driven by our strong Q2 performance as well as the anticipated impact of both the List 4 tariff proposal and the expected tariff rate increase on Lists 1 through 3. In terms of SG&A, we now expect to invest approximately $55 million on our strategic initiative this fiscal year, the majority of which will be on our DG Fresh and Fast Track initiatives. We continue to expect this spending will increase sequentially through the third and fourth quarters.  In summary, I am pleased with our first half results and excited about what's still to come as we look at the back half of the year. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing in initiatives for longer-term growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial goals to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong operating cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. As I've shared with you over the past several quarters, we're investing in and building momentum behind certain strategic initiatives that we believe will drive strong sales and profit growth in the years ahead. I want to take the next few minutes to update you on the progress we are making.  Starting with our Nonconsumable Initiative, or NCI. In 2018, we launched a new and expanded assortment in key nonconsumable categories, including home, domestics, housewares, party and occasion. I'm pleased to report that the NCI offering continues to resonate with customers as evidenced by strong sales performance across our enhanced product categories. Importantly, this performance is contributing to improvements in both sales and gross margin rate in these stores. In addition to higher nonconsumable sales, we are also seeing a positive halo effect in consumable sales. Overall, remodels that include NCI delivered greater sales lift and improved gross margin rates compared to traditional remodels. These results reinforce our belief that NCI can be meaningful to our sales line and a margin driver as we move ahead. The NCI offering was available in more than 1,500 stores at the end of the second quarter, and we plan to expand the offering to a total of approximately 2,400 stores by the end of 2019. And while the NCI store count is still relatively small compared to our overall store base, we are realizing additional benefits by leveraging learnings from these stores. Specifically, we are incorporating select NCI products throughout the broader store base, resulting in positive sales and margin contributions across the entire chain.  Turning now to DG Fresh, which we introduced earlier this year. As a reminder, DG Fresh is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods such as dairy, deli and frozen products. This assortment currently represents approximately 8% of our total sales. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs on our frozen and refrigerated items, thereby enhancing gross margin. And while still early, we are very pleased with the progress and gross margin improvements we are seeing. Two other important goals of DG Fresh are to drive on-time delivery and higher in-stock levels. For example, we have historically seen about a 10-point gap in in-stock levels between our dry goods and our fresh products. We believe we can close the gap with DG Fresh, which is [Audio Gap] Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, please standby.  [Technical Difficulty] Todd Vasos : Okay. And I apologize, we dropped the line somehow.  I'll start back with 2 other important goals for DG Fresh are to drive on-time delivery and higher in-stock levels. For example, we have historically seen about a 10-point gap in our in-stock levels between our dry goods and our fresh products. We believe we can close the gap with DG Fresh, which is supported by results in our early phases of the rollout. In addition to gross margin and in-stock benefits, DG Fresh will eventually allow us to control our own destiny on assortment in these categories. This could include a wider selection of both national and private brands as well as an enhanced offering for our Better For You items. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout plans, we believe DG Fresh could provide a potential path forward to expanding our produce offerings to more stores in the future. We began shipping from our first DG Fresh facility in Pottsville, Pennsylvania in January and are now shipping from 2 additional DG Fresh facilities in Clayton, North Carolina; and Atlanta, Georgia. I'm also pleased to report that our fourth DG Fresh facility in Westville, Indiana is scheduled to begin shipping in the next few weeks. In total, we are now self-distributing to more than 3,500 stores, an increase of approximately 2,700 stores from the end of Q1. And with an anticipated opening of our fourth facility, we remain on track to capture benefits from DG Fresh in approximately 5,000 stores by year-end. In short, we are very excited about the early results we are seeing from this initiative as well as the long-term potential benefits it can deliver for our customers and our business. We continue to believe it can be as -- accretive as early as 2020.  With respect to our digital initiative, our efforts remain focused on deploying technology to further complement the customer in-store experience. In turn, we believe digital can drive additional traffic as well as increase in basket size. In fact, our digitally engaged customers check out with average baskets twice as large as the company average. Our digital efforts continue to be based on the needs of our core customer. Most recently, we introduced a new shopping list feature, representing yet another enhancement to our Dollar General mobile app. This tool not only allows customers to build and save shopping lists but makes it even easier for them to save money through digital coupon, push notifications and comparable private brand product suggestions. We also continue to innovate within our DG GO! app. As a reminder, this app allows customers to use their phone to scan items as they shop; see a running total of the items in their basket, using our Cart Calculator tool; and then skip the line by using DG GO! checkout, which is currently available in more than 250 stores. We plan to consolidate DG GO! into one primary Dollar General app in Q3 of 2019, furthering our efforts of delivering an even more frictionless shopping experience to our customers. We have previously noted that our customers are using Cart Calculator functionality frequently as a budgeting and optimization tool, even when they're not using DG GO! to checkout. Based on this insight, we have made Cart Calculator available in approximately 12,000 stores as we continue to leverage customer insights and innovation to deliver on our customers' needs.  Looking ahead, we remain focused on leveraging our current digital infrastructure and Dollar General app to further enhance our value and convenient proposition for our consumers. Our plans include a pilot of [ DG Pickup ] in the second half, which is our buy online, pick up in-store offering, and we are excited about the additional opportunities that lie ahead. Our digital efforts will continue to be tailored specifically to the Dollar General customer and are an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Moving now to an update on Fast Track. As a reminder, Fast Track is centered on increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. There are 2 key components to Fast Track. First is streamlining the stocking process in our stores through rolltainer optimization and with even more shelf-ready packaging. These efforts should reduce the amount of time spent stocking shelves during the truck unloading and restocking process throughout the week. We continue to make good progress with incorporating more shelf-ready packaging, and I'm pleased to note that we are well ahead of schedule with our rolltainer optimization efforts. In fact, we have completed sorting 1/2 of our distribution centers and are encouraged by the early results, including positive feedback from our store teams. Our goal is to complete the resorting process in all remaining distribution centers by year's end. The second key component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which we believe can further improve speed of checkout while also reducing the amount of labor hours needed in stores for this activity. Our goal remains to pilot self-checkout in select stores in the back half of this year. Overall, we are making great progress on our strategic initiatives, enabled through focused and disciplined execution. We believe we are an innovative leader in our channel, and we are well positioned to capture market share in a changing retail environment. Along with our strategic initiatives, we remain committed to our 4 operating priorities. Let us take the last few minutes to update you on a few of those efforts. Our first operating priority is to drive profitable sales growth. The team has developed a comprehensive plan to drive continued growth with several ongoing initiatives. Let me quickly highlight just a few. Starting with our cooler door expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. We began our cooler expansion efforts in earnest in 2013 and believe we continue to have ample runway with this important program. During the first half, we added more than 20,000 cooler doors across the store base. In total, we expect to install over 40,000 cooler doors this year as we continue to build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. In addition to being a great sales and traffic driver, the expansion of our cooler door footprint over the years has provided the scale necessary to enable DG Fresh. Importantly, our DG Fresh learnings and success to date, we are increasing the capacity of our cooler doors. More specifically, we have recently begun incorporating higher-capacity coolers into our real estate program. These coolers provide over 45% more holding capacity than traditional coolers which will allow us to expand our assortment offerings by approximately 25%, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver a wider product selection. Going forward, these higher-capacity coolers will be included in the majority of all new remodel, relocated stores and new stores. We believe these efforts better position us to capture additional sales opportunities as we move ahead, including those associated with DG Fresh. Turning now to our private brands, which continues to be an important area of focus for us. Our goal is to drive overall category awareness and adoption with our customers through improved and more impactful displays, consistent messaging in-store as well as across print and digital media and enhanced quality perception. I'm pleased with our continued progress across these fronts, which contributed to our strong second quarter performance. Our Good & Smart brand is especially popular with our customers and remains an important part of our Better For You offering. As a reminder, this product line provides customers with a variety of Better For You options at low prices and is now available in approximately 3,900 stores with plans for further expansion as we move forward. Another key contributor to our growing private brand popularity is Believe, our new and aspirational cosmetic line. With all items priced at $5 and below, the quality and value perception associated with this brand is generating tremendous buzz, and we are pleased with the early results. We are also seeing positive results from our recent rebranding efforts with our Studio Selection line within the health and beauty category, and we believe customers will be equally responsive to our most recent rebrand, Gentle Steps, which is our new baby products line. Overall, private brands remain an important part of our ongoing strategy to drive profitable sales growth, and we are excited by the momentum we are seeing across our portfolio. Finally, I want to touch on our recent partnerships with Western Union and FedEx. Western Union is now available chain-wide, offering our customers the ability to send and receive cash in nearly 16,000 convenient Dollar General locations. Building on the Western Union service is our recent partnership with FedEx which we announced during Q2. This partnership will provide our customers with convenient access to FedEx pickup and drop-off services at their local Dollar General store. We plan to roll out this service to over 1,500 locations in Q3, expanding to a total of more than 8,000 stores by the end of 2020, further advancing our long track record of serving rural communities. By further enhancing our convenient proposition with new services that our customers want, we believe both offerings can become traffic drivers over time. As you hear from us often, the customer is at the center of everything we do. These are great examples of being able to further leverage our unique real estate footprint to increase access to the solutions our customers want and the communities we call home. Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, we are continuing our efforts to enhance gross margin. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI, DG Fresh and private brand efforts, reducing shrink remains an important opportunity for us. We rolled out approximately 2,000 additional Electronic Article Surveillance units in the second quarter, bringing the total number of stores with EAS to approximately 12,600. Given the success we continue to see with this program, we are accelerating our efforts. In fact, we now expect to incorporate EAS in all stores by year's end, which represents an increase of about 6,000 units compared to our previously target of approximately 3,000 units for the year. We also continue to pursue distribution and transportation efficiencies to support our profitable sales growth. Reducing stem miles is an important contributor to these efforts, and the successful opening of our Longview distribution center earlier this year is expected to drive additional efficiencies as we move ahead. In addition, the construction of our distribution center in Amsterdam, New York is progressing nicely, and we anticipate it will begin shipping later this year. We are also accelerating the expansion of our private fleet, which now intend to add more than 100 tractors this year, up from our previous goal of 75 tractors, bringing our total overall fleet to approximately 300 units by year's end. Finally, while tariff impact mitigation is at the forefront of our global merchandising efforts, as we noted earlier, foreign sourcing remains a long-term gross margin opportunity. Our goals include increasing penetration as well as diversifying countries from which we source. In fact, we have already reduced our sourcing exposure to China this year alone by approximately 7%, and we continue to lay the foundation for ongoing success in these efforts.  Our second priority is catching growth opportunities. Our best-in-class real estate team continues to deliver strong results, and our proven high-return, low-risk model for real estate growth continues to be a core strength of the business. Our real estate model continues to focus on 5 metrics that have served us well in evaluating thousands of new stores in recent years. These metrics include new store productivity, actual sales performance, rate of return, cannibalization and the payback period. Each of these metrics continue to meet or exceed our expectations, reinforcing our belief that new store growth is the best use of our capital. In addition to new store growth, our remodel and relocation program continues to be an important part of our real estate strategy. This year, we plan to open 975 new stores, remodel 1,000 of our mature stores and relocate approximately 100 units. We remain on track to achieve these goals by the end of the year. During the first half, we opened 489 new stores; remodeled 653 stores, including 254 stores in the Dollar General Traditional Plus, or DGTP; remodeled and relocated 46 stores. We also added produce in 64 stores, bringing the total number of stores which carry produce to approximately 550. As a reminder, a traditional remodel delivers a 4% to 5% comp lift on average. This compares to an average of 10% to 15% comp lift for a DGTP remodel, which is a traditional store format with expanded cooler count. And when we are able to add produce to a DGTP remodel, it delivers comps at the higher end of the 10% to 15% range. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and we are excited about the continued growth opportunities ahead. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. A cost-control mindset is pervasive throughout the organization, and it is an important part of our culture. We have a clear and defined process to control spending which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. We continue to focus our efforts on reducing existing costs where possible through a zero-based budgeting process. I'm pleased with the team's efforts this quarter which helped to mitigate the impact of the investments made in our strategic initiatives and contributed to the leverage in adjusted SG&A expense that John noted earlier. In addition to generating significant cost savings to date, this process also produced other meaningful initiatives, including Fast Track, which we believe can significantly reduce costs over time as well as our recent partnerships with Western Union and FedEx and the income associated with these service offerings. Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs in the communities we call home. And for those associates already on the team, this growth is generating many opportunities for career advancement. In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes, and we continue to innovate on the development opportunities we can offer our teams, including continued expansion of our private fleet and those associated with DG Fresh. We believe our continued engagement with our employees is the most effective way to understand how we can continue to support them. Importantly, our strong employee engagement metrics continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. In addition, we analyze a variety of metrics to ensure we remain positioned to attract and retain talent. These metrics include store manager turnover, which continues to trend better than last year's all-time record low. We also continue to be pleased with our applicant flows and time-to-fill open positions, reaffirming our belief we continue to be an employer of choice in the communities we serve. We held our annual leadership meeting in Nashville last week, and I was once again amazed by the energy and dedication on display from more than 1,500 leaders of our company from across the country. Our time together each year reinforces for me how powerfully the Serving Others culture is ingrained in our people. In closing, we are excited about our strong position midway through the year. Our first half results demonstrate strong execution across a variety of fronts, and I am proud of the team's performance. We have many exciting projects and initiatives underway to continue driving strong growth through the rest of 2019 and over the long term. As a mature retailer in growth mode, we believe we are uniquely positioned to continue delivering value and convenience to our customers and long-term value for our shareholders. I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our approximately 141,000 employees across the company for their commitment to serving our customers and communities, and I look forward to working together to deliver a strong second half.  With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Between you and your Dollar Store multi-price point competitor, you posted some of the best comps we've seen in a while, particularly on a multiyear stack basis. So, Todd, do you think that this is the right economy for your model? Or is what you're experiencing just more a function of all the various initiatives that you have in place right now like improving on-shelf availability by 20%? Todd Vasos : Yes. Michael, we have said for many, many years and we continue to believe that this model works great in good times and in not-so-good times or even bad times. I tell you the success that we're seeing is really -- and I'm really proud of the teams from our merchandising, to operations, the supply chain teams to delivering on both our shorter-term initiatives and our longer-term strategic initiatives. I would tell you we continue to see a bright future and runway ahead of us on our top line, and we will continue to execute -- and which is one of our strengths to execute at a high level these initiatives. We believe we've got the right initiatives to drive sales into the future. Michael Lasser : And would that mean that, Todd, your implied guidance for the back half does look like it -- with just the comps, will slow a little bit? Is that based on what you're seeing now? Or is there any other factor that would drive a slowdown in the business? John Garratt : Mike, this is John. I'll tell you that we feel great about the business fundamentals and the continued profitable sales growth we delivered in Q2. We raised our outlook based on the strong year-to-date performance, but there's a lot of year left. There's tougher half -- there's tougher laps in the back half, and there's some uncertainty around the macro environment, but we feel comfortable with the guidance provided and feel great about the way the business is performing. Todd Vasos : And also, Michael, just remember, we've got 6 less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, and I also want to remind everybody the SNAP pull-forward last year from Q1 into Q4 was about 70 basis points. So that will be a headwind in the Q4 time frame this year. As John indicated, I -- we believe we have adequately put all that into what we believe is our pretty strong guidance for the back half of the year. Michael Lasser : And, Todd, you were helpful to provide the number that you've reduced your exposure to China by 7%. Where does the total overall percent reside right now? Todd Vasos : Yes. It's no secret, right? I mean those moves have been in effect for -- or underway for many months now and in other parts of Southeast Asia, Mexico, another place that we've seen some success, so we continue to diversify country of origin. The great thing is we've had boots on the ground in Mexico, Vietnam, Cambodia and many other Southeast Asian countries, including India as well for many, many years, and so we're just leveraging that capability to an even greater -- a greater time right now with these tariffs and the uncertainty around those. Operator : The next question will come from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on a great quarter and nice execution. So, John, maybe on the gross margin. Can you help walk through the drivers behind the inflection back to the second quarter gross margin expansion? As we look ahead, what inning are we in today as we think about the gross margin opportunity related to DG Fresh and your nonconsumables initiative? And just any way to help size up the multiyear gross margin opportunity that may be tied to these initiatives, I think, would be really helpful. John Garratt : Well, thank you, Matthew. I'll start by saying we feel great about the balanced Q2 performance with the strong top line while enhancing our margin 13 basis points over last year. If you recall back, as we said we would, we continued to be more targeted in promotional activity, leveraging the tools we put in place to be more efficient on the spend to get more bang for the buck, as you saw, delivering strong comps and traffic while being more efficient with that spend. We're also really excited about what we're seeing from the impact of new initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI. We're seeing the impact of that, and that will scale as we go on. We said in our prepared comments that we expect rate improvement in the second half to be roughly in line with Q2 compared on a year-over-year basis. And while there continues to be headwinds in our environment, we believe we have opportunities to increase margins over time. As these initiatives scale, they'll be a bigger and bigger impact on our margin and we have a lot of other levers at our disposal. The team did a great job on category management. We see continued opportunity to increase foreign sourcing penetration. As we talked about in our prepared comments, there's a lot of exciting things going on with private label that can help increase that penetration. There's a lot of opportunities to increase supply chain efficiencies. The team did a great job last year mitigating the impact to that. We're in a more stable environment now, and there's a lot of leverage there. We have great support from our vendor community, and we just believe we're making the right investments to grow operating margin over the long term and believe we have a lot of other levers at our disposal that we've made great trade-offs over time. Matthew Boss : That's great. And then just a follow-up on the expense front, how best to think about SG&A dollar growth versus sales in the back half of the year. Maybe what's the efficiency opportunity you see from Fast Track? And any obstacles you see to returning to the 2.5% to 3% fixed cost hurdle as we move to next year? John Garratt : Yes. So there, too, we're very proud of the first half performance, both Q2 and first half. If you exclude the impact of the legal charge, we leveraged our SG&A while investing $19 million year-to-date at SG&A. As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we're accelerating the spend a little bit, $55 million this year versus the previous $50 million estimate, and that's really a reflection of accelerating investment in key strategic initiatives like DG Fresh and Fast Track. As we've said, there are some front-end pressure associated with that. There are some start-up costs that pressure SG&A, but we like to look more broadly at operating profit. And as you look at operating profit, we really believe that these initiatives, over time, will not just enhance sales but improve our operating profit over the long term. So we have to work through the start-up expenses. We said that as we go through the year that the expenditures against these initiatives will grow, and the majority of which is against DG Fresh and Fast Track. But we're also seeing the benefits of the scale as well, such that as we get into next year, we still expect these to be accretive as early as next year. Operator : The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : So a little bit of a follow-up on the gross margin. In the prepared comments, you said it should -- Fresh could be accretive as early as next year. I wanted to ask what the gating factor is on the timing and the magnitude of that. Todd Vasos : As you look at DG Fresh, we are squarely focused on delivering and executing at a very high level. And I would tell you that we're very, very encouraged in what we see. We're getting the cost of goods savings we expected with the 3,500 initial stores that we've rolled out, and we still feel that it's going to be accretive as early as 2020. Again, we're already starting to see some of this. It was asked earlier what inning are you, and I would tell you we just got up to the plate, and I think we just hit a good solid double or triple in the first quarter of this DG Fresh rollout. So I think we got a lot more opportunity ahead of us, and it should benefit us both on the sales and gross margin lines as we move forward. Simeon Gutman : And I think the as early as 2020 comment, so it sounds like it's going well so far. I guess you need to do more -- a higher percentage of the chain. But if things continue to go as planned, it sounds like that's going to be the inflection point into next year as far as becoming gross margin accretive. Is that fair? Todd Vasos : I think that's the way to look at it. With 3,500 stores against our 16,000-or-so store base right now, it's the law of numbers. And we'll be up to 5,000 by the end of this year, and we don't see that slowing, as we've indicated. And so we believe that as we move into '20, it will definitely be accretive. Simeon Gutman : And just -- and I guess still sticking to gross margin, is the magnitude of the benefit you're seeing and the initial rollouts of it, is it -- how is it playing relative to your expectations? John Garratt : Yes. As we convert items, as we convert stores, it is right where we thought it would be in terms of the cost savings, that is substantial cost savings that, as we said, as we scale, that will be very impactful to helping our gross margin. Operator : The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Also, congrats on a really strong quarter. So maybe to start out, I was just curious to get your thoughts, latest -- your latest views on the healthier consumer. And I was curious, as you look at some of your surveys that you do with your consumers, are tariff concerns are popping up at all in the conversation? Todd Vasos : Yes. I would tell you, as you know, Rupesh, we really talk to our consumers each and every quarter. And she is telling us about the same as we've -- that we've talked about before. She's still back to work, making a little bit more money, working more hours versus actual average hourly rate being up for her is really more productivity, more hours. And she is feeling a little bit more timid, just like we've seen in past -- in the past couple of quarters. But I would tell you that tariff has not really been -- she has not called that out, and she really hasn't called out a lot of headwinds yet from what she would think about as price increases or inflation. So she really hasn't been calling that out, at least up till now. But we're really mindful that with List 4 getting ready to take effect across all retail that she still may see some of that. The great thing about this model is that we do good in good times and in bad times, right, or when she needs us more. And we stand ready, willing and able to deliver to her as she may need us a little bit more toward the back half and the early part of next year. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then one follow-up question. We've been getting some questions just on some of the proposed SNAP changes out there. I was curious if you have any initial views towards those proposals. John Garratt : Yes. What I would say as a reminder that if you look at our SNAP sales tender as a percentage of the total, it's less than 5%. And if you look at the guidance we've provided, we've estimated what we think the impact of that would be, and that's all captured in the guidance. Operator : The next question is from Chris Prykull with Goldman Sachs. Christopher Prykull : I just wanted to ask a little bit about that nonconsumable initiative. It sounds like things are going pretty well there. Can you maybe just give a little bit more detail about the categories that you're seeing the most benefit in, the halo benefit that you mentioned? Can you quantify the incremental lift that you're seeing in the remodels where that initiative is being added? And then how many stores could you roll that out to in 2020 and beyond? Todd Vasos : Yes. We're very pleased with the early results. As we indicated, we'll have up to 2,400 stores up and running by the end of this year. We believe we can do many, many more, if not the entire chain eventually, the way this is starting to play out. We're very happy with the gross margin opportunities that are existing out of this. The stores that we have converted over already are seeing strong gross margin lifts for the entire store and sales lifts for the entire store, which is exactly what we thought would happen. So as we continue to scale this, it will continue to have a bigger and bigger impact on our total store, both margin and top line. The great thing is we're into our fifth replenishment cycle already and are seeing great results from even now into our fifth replenishment. And that's from the consumer takeaway to how our stores and our operators have been able to manage a new muscle, if you will, in working no planogram but yet working the treasure hunt environment, and they've done a fabulous job with it. So we're really pleased with what we see. And in my prepared remarks, I think you also remember hearing we've taken some of those learnings, not only items, but in some cases, full categories, and we have now flushed it through the other part of the chain, so upwards of 16,000 stores. So you're seeing strength, which was the other part of your question, in seasonal and in home, in domestics. Those are some of the areas that we're seeing some of the biggest increases. We saw great increases in party and occasion. And when you think about party, it crosses everything from plates, cups, napkins, to balloons, helium balloons doing very, very well for us. So it's really across the board. Christopher Prykull : Great. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up. Any way to quantify the impact from your partnerships with FedEx or Western Union? Or maybe just some thoughts around the strategic rationale for doing those. Are your locations, on average, closer to customer households than FedEx or Western Union locations? John Garratt : This is John. Good question. What I'll say, while not material to 2019, we're very excited about the partnership. If you look at FedEx, we'll be starting out with 1,500 stores in Q3, scaling to 8,000 by the end of 2020. Western Union there, too, early stages there in all the stores. What we really think this demonstrates is our ability to further leverage our unique footprint and provide services to underserved customers that others have difficulty getting to. And with service partnerships like this and there could be others, we believe we're helping drive traffic. They also can be effective income drivers to the business as well, so we're excited about what it does for the customer and how it can help our financials going forward. Operator : The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : And I'll add my congratulations as well. Great quarter. I just want to ask on guidance. So when I look at your operating profit per square foot, the growth that you saw this quarter, I mean, it was the best growth rate in what I count is like 11 quarters. And it just seems that with respect to what drove it this quarter, a lot of those things are actually sustainable through the back half, and I know you pointed to some areas of conservatism. But maybe you could just parse that out a little bit because it does feel like full year guidance is being extremely conservative. John Garratt : Thanks, Karen. I'll start by saying we feel great about the business fundamentals and how we start out the year with strong top line and bottom line performance. And based on that raised our outlook, it's important to -- you remember that we did absorb additional tariff increases into our guidance while still raising it. So there's a lot of year left, but we feel comfortable with the guidance we provided. Karen Short : Okay. And then just a follow-up. You did call out higher shrink within the gross margin. Any color there, obviously, because EAS has benefited shrink over the last several quarters? John Garratt : As you pointed out, over the last 3 years, the team's done a great job significantly reducing shrink. But as we've said before, it's never a straight line to the top. We always look to balance shrink with in-stock, and obviously, this year, as we've said, really doing great work around improving our in-stock levels. But we continue to see shrink improvement over the long term. One of the biggest wins we've had lately is EAS. We opened -- we added 2,000 more EAS units in Q2. Based on the successful results we've seen from EAS, as we mentioned, we're expanding that. Rather than adding 3,000 this year, we're now going to add 6,000, finish out the chain, really just given the results we've seen from this. So we expect that to continue to help us reduce shrink over the long term and continue to see opportunity there. Karen Short : Okay. But nothing specific to point out this quarter? Todd Vasos : No. None. Operator : The next question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : I just wanted to ask a more strategic question of the team given the fact that all these initiatives are starting or will start to bear a lot of fruit. I'm just trying to understand where you think there's some levers. I mean if I look at Home Depot, they kind of keep their gross margins flat and reinvest pretty heavily to drive sales. I was wondering what your kind of thoughts are strategically that way. Can you use price as a lever? Do you speed up the Fresh? I mean what do you do with the -- as it looks like the profitability of the company is going to continue to accelerate. Todd Vasos : Again, we feel very good about the strategic initiatives in total, and we've always said we reserve the right at any time to continue to reinvest back into the company. But those of you that know us well, we don't do any of that without a solid return attached to any of those investments. And that's the strength of Dollar General is that and our execution level. And I would tell you that we feel good about where we are today on the strategic initiatives we have out there. We have a plethora of them, as you know, but the great thing is we're executing at a high level across all of them. And many of them are aimed right at gross margin, and some of them are aimed right at the SG&A line to continue -- so that we can continue to grow our operating margins. And that's really what we're squarely focused on is operating margins. Scott Mushkin : And, Todd, so if you look at it and you look at kind of the modern DG stores that's evolving, I mean, it seems to really replace for a shopper or could replace a shopper, certainly many trips to the grocery stores but maybe even to the supercenters. And as a follow-up question to what I just asked you, I mean, do you see this as a vehicle to increase trips? And where do you think pricing plays in that as you look at the company over the next couple of years? Todd Vasos : Yes. If you look at where we are, our pricing is as solid as good as it's ever been against all classes of trade. So we feel very good about that, and we watch that each and every quarter. That is the cornerstone, if you will, of our value proposition here at Dollar General. We're squarely focused on serving that customer. We are a fill-in shop. We are not a full stock-up, a full shop or a big stock-up shop. But in saying that, we want to make sure that the value and convenient nature of Dollar General is enhanced at all times. And many of these initiatives go right against those type of items to make sure that, in fact, that convenient level is there for her. And we talk to our core customers each and every quarter, as I mentioned earlier, and she does tell us that she wants more products from us. And that's really what we're delivering and especially in rural America where options are very limited. So if we can deliver a fresh offering that's strong and a Better For You offering, which we're doing in many of these stores, there's a healthy option for her as well in these communities. And if it means that she doesn't have to make another trip to a big-box store somewhere in the month, then I think it benefits her greatly. And that's how we sort of look at how we're building this Dollar General for the future. Operator : The next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : And great quarter. Just a few quick ones for me. One, with the higher-capacity coolers, does that involved in taking away any allocation of space from other categories and are utilizing that to actually add in some new and incremental SKUs versus just make sure you have increased availability of current items? And then on private label and private brands, certainly sounds like there's success there. Can you quantify at all or let us know to what extent your private brands are growing relative to national brands? Todd Vasos : Sure, Paul. Yes. So when you look at the higher-capacity coolers, again, as I stated earlier, we don't do anything here without a return against it and without testing and learning. That's the core strength of Dollar General. And these higher-capacity coolers are the exact same coolers that are in the DGTP stores, just not as quite as many doors. So it's the same coolers, the same exact ones. And so to answer your question specifically, we do lose a little hanging apparel when we go to remodel, relocate or put it in a new store with these higher-capacity coolers. But once again, as I've been stating for many quarters now, we continue to reduce our hanging apparel for better traffic-driving items across the chain. So this is just a continuation and an acceleration, quite frankly, of our ability to be able to do that. It does give you both sides of the equation, to your point. It gives you higher capacity so that you're in-stock, especially on a lot of fast-moving goods, but it also gives you the opportunity for 25% more new items in these coolers versus the smaller, lower-capacity ones we had before. And that will increase sales. So both your in-stocks will increase sales, and the assortment will increase sales. Again, our core consumer is asking us for more products in our fresh, frozen and dairy and deli items, and that's exactly what we're going to deliver to her. So we're excited. This is -- this wasn't contemplated in our earlier rollout this year. But as we continue to see the success of our DGTP remodels, we thought it was the best use of our capital to go in and do those, and that's exactly what we're doing. And then as it relates to private brands, we're very happy with all the work that the team has done around private brands in the last couple of quarters. They've been [ ready enough ] to be able to deliver to the customer an even enhanced value proposition there. Our Believe makeup line is doing phenomenal. It got so much buzz across social media, across CNN this past quarter and has driven a lot of additional traffic into our stores and again everything under $5. And so I would tell you that our private brands are growing at a very nice clip, and we only see that benefiting our core consumer even greater as time goes on. And we continue to relaunch things like Gentle Steps that I talked about in our baby line. So more to come there. I believe that we're in the early innings of what Dollar General can do with private brands in totality. We're really, really happy with what we see. And quite frankly, a lot of integration in our signing, in our advertising also helps. So when the consumer gets to the store, she sees a consistent message, and she understands that message. Paul Trussell : And then, lastly, for me, just on the [ Pickup ] pilot, can you just tell us how you're going to approach that? Todd Vasos : Yes. We're going to go slow here. We want to make sure that the consumer resonates with that. So remember, our average basket size is $12 or less, 5 items or less, on average. So it's a little bit different shop than what you would find in a big-box retailer. And so buy online, pick up in store will be no different. It will be a different shop. But what we believe we can do is offer her another leg of convenience so that she can come to the store, pick up what she needs, probably add an item or 2 to her online pickup and then be able to get out very, very quickly. And so we're going to test it. We're going to go slow here. We're going to test it in the back half of the year. And as I indicated last quarter, we believe that the customer will resonate with this, but we'll have to wait and see. But again, I think it's important to note here that we're not going to sit back and wait for the customer to already be there. We're going to meet her, our core customer, where we believe she's going to be. And having this ready and ready to roll out in a large-scale way, somewhere down the line, I think, is the exact right thing to do, no different than e-commerce for us. We've had an e-commerce site up and running for the better part of 7 years now. And when our core consumer is ready to buy more online, all we have to do is turn the dial up there, and that will be no different than buy online, pick up in the store. Operator : The final question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Robert Ohmes : Todd, I know we've seen in our price studies how well you guys are doing in pricing, and you got all these great initiatives. Just could you speak to us about the competitive environment? Has anything changed? Are you seeing regional grocers raise prices which we think we've seen in some cases? Have you seen store closings, smaller players that were not able to track go out of business? Any kind of color on that would be fantastic. Todd Vasos : Yes. Sure, Robby. We -- I would tell you that, again, we are -- as well positioned on price against all classes of trade than we've been in the 10, almost 11 years that I've been here at Dollar General. And it is the cornerstone of that value, convenience proposition to our customer. And in saying that, we really haven't seen too much of a difference broadly on pricing, whether it be every day or promotional. It's been fairly tame out there. But in saying that, we continue to work the price levers to make sure that we're right priced in every DMA that we serve out there across the country. And as you look, with our scale getting larger and larger each and every year and our ability to keep prices low because of our limited SKU assortment that we have, we continue to be very well priced. And that's exactly what our consumers are looking for. And that's why we know that either in good times or bad, those consumers are going to come flocking in to see Dollar General. And the last thing I would say is that our fastest-growing segment still is the consumer making over $50,000 a year. That's the fastest-growing segment we have, and I think that really speaks to every consumer is looking for value and is looking for convenience. And I believe that all the work we're doing inside of our box to transform it into an all-around shop is really resonating with the customer.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter results, including same-store sales growth of 4.6% and strong performance across the business. The quarter was highlighted by our best customer traffic and same-store sales increases in nearly 5 years as well as double-digit growth in both operating profit and diluted EPS. As a result of our performance through Q3 and outlook for Q4, we are raising our full year guidance for 2019. John will provide these details during his remarks.  In short, we are executing well against both our operating and strategic priorities, and we're confident in our plans to drive continued growth. On that note, I'm excited to share an update on some of these plans, which we believe will further differentiate Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.  First, as you saw in our release, we plan to accelerate our pace of new store openings and remodels in 2020. In total, we expect to execute nearly 2,600 real estate projects next year, which represents an increase of more than 20% over 2019 as we continue to strengthen the foundation for future growth. In addition, given the sustained and positive performance of our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI, we plan to expand the offering to an additional 2,600 stores next year, bringing the total number of NCI stores to approximately 5,000 by the end of 2020, more than double the current store count. Finally, we now plan to begin shipping out of our fifth DG Fresh facility by as early as fiscal year-end 2019.  I will discuss each of these updates in more detail later in the call. But first, let's recap some of the top line results for the quarter. Net sales increased 8.9% to $7 billion compared to net sales of $6.4 billion in the third quarter of 2018. We are particularly pleased with the balanced nature of our sales performance this quarter, once again driven by meaningful contributions across many fronts, including sustained positive sales momentum across our new stores and mature store base, strong same-store sales growth in both our consumable and nonconsumable product categories and another quarter of solid growth in average basket size and customer traffic. Once again, this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data with mid- to high single-digit growth in both units and dollars over the 4, 12, 24 and 52-week periods ending November 2, 2019. Notably, our market share gains increased at an accelerated rate throughout these periods, which we believe speaks to the underlying strength and continued momentum of the business. Our third quarter results further validate our belief that the actions we've taken and the investments we've made are further enabling sustainable long-term growth while continuing to deliver value and convenience for our customers. We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And with the plans and initiatives we have in place, we are well positioned to drive continued growth in the years ahead.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the third quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year and all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29.5% in the third quarter, an increase of 1 basis point. This increase was primarily attributable to higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales and a lower LIFO provision. Partially offsetting these items were : increased transportation and distribution costs; higher shrink, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category; and sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category. SG&A as a percent of sales was 22.5% or a decrease of 13 basis points. The decrease was driven by a year-over-year reduction in hurricane-related expenses, a reduction in expenses for store supplies and lower retail labor costs as a percentage of sales. These items were partially offset by an increase in utilities costs.  As previously discussed, we are investing in our 4 strategic initiatives this year. We are pleased with the continued progress on each and remain excited about the long-term transformative potential of these initiatives. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we have invested $33 million in SG&A expense attributable to our strategic initiatives. We continue to believe these investments position us well to deliver meaningful benefits to the business over both the intermediate and longer term. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter increased 11.1% to $491 million compared to $442 million in the third quarter of 2018. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 7%, an increase of 14 basis points, which represents operating margin expansion even as we continue to invest for the long term. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.7% and compares to a rate of 20% in the third quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the third quarter increased 12.7% to $1.42. Overall, we are pleased with the balanced performance the team delivered during the quarter, once again resulting in strong sales and profit growth. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong, merchandise inventories were $4.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 13% overall and up 6.9% on a per-store basis. We continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in great shape and remain focused over time on driving inventory growth that is in line with or below our total sales growth. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $1.7 billion, an increase of 9.7%. Total capital expenditures through the first 3 quarters of 2019 were $518 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations; continued investments in construction of our Amsterdam, New York distribution center; and spending related to the strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $400 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $82 million. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization, we have remaining authorization of $1.6 billion under the repurchase program. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt-to-EBITDA. Moving to an update on our annual guidance for fiscal 2019. As Todd mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance, primarily due to our strong operating performance through the first 3 quarters and expectations for the remainder of the year. For fiscal 2019, we now expect net sales growth in the low 8% range and same-store sales growth in the mid- to high 3% range. We are increasing our expectations for operating profit growth to approximately 6% to 8% and expect adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 7% to 9%. And we are raising our outlook for EPS to the range of $6.46 to $6.56 or adjusted EPS of $6.55 to $6.65, which translates to a range of approximately 10% to 11% growth on an adjusted basis. Our adjusted operating profit growth and adjusted EPS guidance exclude the $31 million pretax impact related to significant legal expenses that were recorded in the second quarter. Both our GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance assume an estimated effective tax rate within the range of approximately 22% to 22.5%. In terms of share repurchases, we now plan to repurchase approximately $1.2 billion of our common stock this year, which represents an increase of about $200 million relative to our previous expectation. Finally, our 2019 outlook for real estate projects and capital spending remains unchanged.  Let me now provide some additional context on our current expectations. First, our guidance does not contemplate additional increases in tariff rates or the expansion of products subject to tariffs. Beyond those which are currently in effect are included in the list 4B China tariff proposal. As a reminder, we have some sales-related headwinds associated with the shortened holiday selling season and the lapping of an estimated 70 basis point sales comp benefit from the pull-forward of SNAP payments into last year's fourth quarter. With regards to gross margin, we continue to expect our rate improvement in the second half to be roughly in line with Q2 when compared on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, we strategically invested in targeted promotional markdown activity in Q4 of 2018, which at this time, we do not plan to repeat. Finally, in terms of SG&A, we continue to expect to invest approximately $55 million in our strategic initiatives in 2019.  In summary, we are very pleased with our results through the first 3 quarters of the year and are excited about our outlook for Q4. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing operating priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong operating cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, John. I'm very proud of the progress the team has made in advancing our key strategic initiatives, which we believe better position us for the long-term sustainable growth. Let us take you through some of the most recent highlights. Starting with our nonconsumable initiative or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded assortment in key nonconsumable categories, including home, domestics, housewares, party and occasion. The NCI offering was available in more than 2,100 stores at the end of the third quarter, and we remain on track to expand the offering to a total of approximately 2,400 stores by the end of 2019. We recently completed our sixth replenishment cycle, and I'm very pleased with the sustained positive sales and margin performance we are seeing across our enhanced product categories. We also continue to see a positive halo effect in consumable sales. Overall, this performance is contributing to improvements in both total sales and gross margin rate in these stores. These results reinforce our belief that NCI can be a meaningful sales and margin driver as we move forward. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, our plans include accelerating the rollout of NCI to a total of about 5,000 stores by the end of 2020 as we look to further complement our strong and growing consumable business.  Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic multi-phased shift to self-distribution of our frozen and refrigerated goods such as dairy, deli and frozen products. These goods currently represent approximately 8% of our total sales. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen refrigerated items, thereby enhancing gross margin. And while still early, we are very pleased with the progress and product cost savings we are seeing. Three other important goals of DG Fresh are to drive on-time deliveries higher, increase in-stock levels and eventually expand our assortment offering in these categories. This could include a wider selection of both national and private brands as well as an enhanced offering of Better For You items. In total, we were self-distributing to approximately 4,900 stores from 4 DG Fresh facilities at the end of fiscal Q3 and now expect to capture benefits from this initiative in more than 5,500 stores by the end of this year. This compares to our previous expectation of approximately 5,000 stores being serviced by DG Fresh at year-end. Given the success we are seeing and great progress by the team, we now plan to begin shipping out of our fifth DG Fresh facility by as early as fiscal year-end 2019. We believe this positions us well to capture additional benefits as we move into next year and as we expect DG Fresh will be accretive to both gross margin and operating profit rate in 2020.  In short, we are very excited about the results we are seeing from this initiative as well as the long-term potential benefit it can deliver for our customers and our business. With respect to our digital initiative, our efforts remain focused on deploying technology to further enhance the customer in-store experience. In total, we believe digital can drive additional traffic as well as an increase in basket size. In turn, our digital engaged customers checkout with an average basket twice as large as the company average. One important element of our digital strategy is pursuing opportunities to expand our customer relationships, including innovating to meet their increasing desire for convenience. To that end, some of the more recent highlights include the consolidation of our DG GO! app into our primary Dollar General app, bringing all our customer-facing digital tools together in one easy-to-use application and furthering our efforts to deliver an even more frictionless shopping experience to our customers. The further rollout, DG GO! checkout, now available in more than 700 stores, which allows customers to use their phones to scan items as they shop, and then skip the line by using a DG GO! checkout. Expansion of our cart calculator in-app shopping and budgeting tool to approximately 15,000 stores, up from about 12,000 stores at the end of the second quarter. And finally, we remain on track to pilot DG pickup, which is our buy online, pick up in store offering during the fourth quarter. Our digital efforts are focused on making things easier for our customers by providing an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. Importantly, these efforts will continue to be tailored specifically to the Dollar General customer and remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Moving now to Fast Track, where our goal includes increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing the customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. There are 2 key components to Fast Track. First is streamlining the stocking process in our stores through rolltainer optimization and with even more shelf-ready packaging. These efforts are designed to reduce the amount of time spent stocking shelves during the truck unloading and restocking process, and we're pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are already seeing. We remain on track to complete our rolltainer optimization efforts by year's end, which is well ahead of schedule and positions us well to drive even greater efficiencies as we move forward. The second key component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which we believe can further improve speed of checkout, while also reducing the amount of labor hours devoted to this activity. We recently launched a pilot in select stores and are pleased with the early results. Overall, we are making great progress with our key strategic initiatives, enabled through focused and disciplined execution. We believe we are the innovative leader in our channel and remain well positioned to capture market share in a changing retail landscape. Along with our strategic initiatives, we remain committed to our 4 operating priorities. Let me take our last few minutes to update you on some of our recent efforts. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team has executed against a comprehensive plan to drive continued sales and profit growth with several ongoing initiatives. Let me quickly highlight just a few. Starting with our cooler door expansion program, which continues to be the most impactful merchandising initiative. During the first 3 quarters, we added nearly 35,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install more than 40,000 cooler doors this year as we continue to build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. As a reminder, last quarter, we began incorporating higher-capacity coolers into the majority of our new, remodeled and relocated stores. These coolers provide 45% more holding capacity than traditional coolers, which will allow us to expand our assortment offering by approximately 25%, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver a wider product selection. We believe these efforts not only extend our runway for growth in cooler doors, but also better positions us to capture additional sales opportunities, including those associated with DG Fresh. Turning now to private brands, which continues to be an important area of focus for us. We know that private brands represents an opportunity to further enhance our value proposition for customers while also benefiting gross margin. We are executing a variety of tactics to drive additional growth of these brands, including enhancing our current offering as well as introducing new product lines. One key area of focus is accelerating growth within our existing private brand portfolio, where our plans consist of rebranding and repositioning these products to drive greater customer penetration. We have seen great success with our efforts to date, including Studio Selection and Gentle Steps, and believe there is significant opportunity with other existing brands as well.  In addition to our rebranding efforts, we have introduced new brands in certain categories where we see sizable opportunities for growth. Recent examples include the introduction of our popular Believe cosmetic line as well as our Good & Smart brand, which remains an important part of our Better For You offering. In fact, as a result of its success, Better For You offering is now available in approximately 55 -- 5,400 stores, with plans for further expansion as we move forward. We are constantly evaluating our private brand portfolio, and we'll look to further enhance our offering when and where we see opportunities. Importantly, we are seeing some of our best private brand sales performance in several years, which reinforces our belief that we are on the right track to deliver an even greater value to our customers while continuing to drive profitable sales growth. Finally, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. During the quarter, we rolled out this convenient package pickup and drop-off service to more than 1,800 stores and expect to be in over 8,000 stores by the end of 2020. And while still early, we are pleased with the reception this services offering is receiving from our customers and continue to believe it will become a traffic driver over time. We continue to explore innovative opportunities to serve our customers, and we are excited about and able to deliver the [ leverage ]. Our unique real estate footprint allows us and also the convenient locations across the country.  Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, we are also focusing efforts on enhancing gross margin. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI, DG Fresh and private brand efforts, shrink reduction remains an important area of focus for us. We added approximately 1,000 additional electronic article surveillance units in the third quarter. Bringing the total number of stores with EAS to approximately 13,600, and we remain on track to incorporate these units in all stores by the end of the year. We also continue to make progress in pursuit of further distribution and transportation efficiencies as we recently began shipping from our 17th traditional distribution center in Amsterdam, New York. Additionally, we remain on track to reach our goal of approximately 300 private fleet tractors by the end of the year. Finally, while the team has made significant progress with our tariff mitigation efforts, we continue to see opportunities to expand our foreign sourcing penetration while diversifying our countries of origin. Overall, we're pleased with the great work the team is doing across the business to further drive profitable sales growth. Our second operating priority is capturing growth opportunities. We celebrated a significant milestone in the third quarter as we opened our 16,000th store. This is a testament to the fantastic work of our best-in-class real estate team. Our proven high-return, low-risk model for real estate continue to be a core strength of the business. As a reminder, our real estate model continues to focus on 5 metrics that have served us well for many years in evaluating new real estate opportunities. These metrics include new store productivity, actual sales performance, average returns, cannibalization and the payback period. Of note, our portfolio of new store openings in 2019 continues to perform very well, consistently beating pro forma expectations. For 2019, we remain on track to open 975 new stores, remodel 1,000 stores and relocate 100 stores. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we opened 769 new stores, remodeled 928 stores, including 480 in the higher cooler count DGTP or DGP formats and relocated 75 stores. We also added produce to 65 stores during the quarter, bringing the total number of stores which carry produce to more than 600.  As I noted earlier, for fiscal year 2020, we plan to open 1,000 new stores, remodel 1,500 stores and relocate 80 stores, representing nearly 2,600 real estate projects in total. Additionally, we plan to add produce in approximately 250 stores in 2020. Notably, we expect more than 1,100 of our remodels to be in the DGTP or DGP format. The remainder of the remodels will primarily be in the traditional format. As a reminder, our traditional remodel stores, which has an average of 22 cooler doors delivers a 4% to 5% comp lift on average. This compares to an average comp lift of 10% to 15% for a DGTP or DGP remodel, which has an average of 34 higher capacity cooler doors. Given the strong results we continue to see from our remodel program, we are excited about the 50% increase in remodels we are targeting for next year. Investing in our mature store base to incorporate our best and most impactful initiatives is an important component of our real estate strategy as we continue to leverage recent learnings and format innovation to capture additional market share. With regards to new stores, we plan to accelerate the rollout of our DGX format next year, targeting about 20 additional stores, bringing the total number of DGX stores to approximately 30 by the year-end 2020. And the remainder of new store openings will primarily be in the traditional format, the majority of which will include higher-capacity coolers. I am very proud of the team's ability to execute such high volumes of successful real estate projects, and we are excited about the continued growth opportunities ahead. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. With the customer always at the center of everything we do, we remain committed to our low-cost approach throughout the organization. We have a clear and defined process to control spending and are constantly seeking opportunities to reduce cost where possible through a zero-based budgeting mindset. This process has produced significant cost savings to date, in addition to fee-generating initiatives such as our FedEx relationship. We believe low cost always drives out high cost, and we are steadfast in our pursuit of these opportunities. Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. These efforts continue to yield positive results across the business, as evidenced by continued record low store manager turnover, strong applicant flow and a robust internal promotional -- excuse me, promotion pipeline. We continue to engage directly with our employees and are pleased with the participation rate and valuable feedback received in our most recent employee engagement surveys. We value these conversations and look forward to continuing our work together to further enhance our position as an employer of choice.  We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. To that end, in 2020, we plan to create more than 8,000 net new jobs, importantly, our growth continues to foster an environment where employees have opportunities to advance to roles with increasing levels of responsibility in a relatively short time frame. In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes, and we continue to seek innovative opportunities to develop our teams. In October, we celebrated our 80th anniversary. A lot of change has occurred in 80 years, but the one constant has been our unique culture, which is deeply rooted in our company mission of serving others. On that note, we recently completed our annual community giving campaign where employees across the organization come together to raise funds for a variety of important causes. I'm impressed every year by the generosity and compassion demonstrated by our team members, which reinforces our culture is alive and well and is a competitive advantage for Dollar General. In closing, we are pleased with another strong quarter and the continued momentum we saw in the business. As a mature retailer and growth mode, we believe we are uniquely positioned to continue delivering value and convenience for our customers and long-term value for our shareholders. As we are working through the busiest months in retail, I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our approximately 140,000 employees across the company for their tireless dedication to serving our customers every day. Our people truly make the difference at Dollar General. And as I had mentioned, their dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others is the bedrock of our culture. We are excited about our results through the first 3 quarters and are working hard to finish the year on a strong note. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. Congrats on a really nice quarter, guys. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Matt. Matthew Boss : Todd, maybe to start off, can you speak to the health of the low-income consumer and maybe how you'd handicap your top line strength that you're seeing today as we think about the industry backdrop versus your own offensive initiatives? Meaning, I guess, how confident are you that you can sustain the drivers of today's top line strength as we look ahead to next year and beyond? Todd Vasos : First, Matt, I would tell you that our core consumer, we see her about where we have the last couple of quarters. She still has a little bit of extra money in her pocket, continues to be employed at a pretty high rate. But always remember, our core customer is always a little stretched and she looks to us to provide that value and convenience that she's come to known from Dollar General.  And as I look into the future, whether it be this quarter or into next year, I would tell you that the continued strength we see in the top line sales results are really a combination of a good consumer. But I would tell you that our initiatives are really starting to work for us across the entire portfolio of businesses we have, both consumables and nonconsumables. So both our shorter-term initiatives around coolers, health and beauty, queue lines, et cetera. But also, you probably noticed, we've had some of our best nonconsumable results that we've had in many years. And a lot of that is coming from our longer-term strategic initiatives, mainly NCI, where we've taken a lot of our NCI learnings and not only have got them in the 2,100 stores that we've already launched it in but we've also flushed it back into the entire chain, many of those very successful planograms that we've set, we've actually put them inside of our 16,000 stores, which is really starting to help drive that top line. So we feel very good about the sustainability of our comps as we go forward. Matthew Boss : Great. And then maybe just a follow-up for John on the gross margin. I guess, any difference between your gross margin performance versus internal plan this quarter, in the third quarter? And then with the acceleration of DG Fresh and NCI into next year, is there any reason why your gross margin expansion opportunity, as we think about next year, would not potentially be larger than the performance that we're seeing this year? John Garratt : Thanks, Matt. I'll start by saying we feel very good about the balanced Q3 performance as we drove a strong top line, as Todd mentioned, while increasing our margin rate slightly. I will tell you that we still see the second half gross margin the same as we did on our last call. We continue to expect rate improvement, as we mentioned, in the second half to be roughly in line with Q2 compared on a year-over-year basis. And we see the same basic drivers there in play. As we said we would, we continue to be more targeted in promotional activity. And as you can see, we continue to drive very strong transaction growth, great balance in our sales and have been growing our share at an accelerating rate. We also expect to see and are seeing continued growth in benefits from initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI, as Todd mentioned.  And as you look forward, I'm not going to comment specifically on 2020. We'll be talking about that in our next call. But just more broadly, as you look over the long term, there's always headwinds there, but we see ourselves in a position to expand our gross margin over the long term. We see growing impact continuing from initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI. We're really focused on our initiatives on the top line and the bottom line. We continue to see opportunity with category management. As we mentioned in our prepared comments, I see a lot of opportunity around foreign sourcing penetration, a lot of great things going on with private label to drive that penetration on the shrink side. We're incorporating EAS in the remainder of the stores this year as well as operational focus on that. It's the opportunity there over the long term. And the team has done a great job on the supply chain side, driving efficiencies. So we believe we're making the right investments, and we believe we have a lot of levers to improve operating margin over the long term, while reserving the right when needed to invest in the customer. Operator : The next question will come from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Congrats on a great quarter. Todd Vasos : Thank you. Rupesh Parikh : So I also wanted to ask a little bit more about your acceleration in your real estate plans for next year. So if you can maybe talk a little bit more about your thinking beyond the decision to accelerate your real estate projects and how you feel about the organizational capacity to handle both the acceleration on a real estate front and really all the initiatives that you continue to have underway. Todd Vasos : Rupesh, thanks for the question. I would tell you, we have really, over the years, built the capability to execute against a very robust pipeline of real estate projects. But even beyond that, we have built the disciplines here and have proven over time that we can handle a lot of complex projects at one time. We have a great group of individuals that work for this company that work hard every day to make sure that we execute at a very, very high level. And that's what really gave us the notion to move a little faster here, knowing the success that we have seen in the recent past. But even more so than that, we want to make sure as we continue to take care of the mature store base of this company and touch every store every 7 to 10 years to make sure it's refreshed and has the best and brightest that we have available, we really need to start to accelerate our remodel programs to help facilitate that every 7- to 10-year touch. But again, we wouldn't be able to do that without all the great work that this team is able to produce in any given year. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then one quick follow-up question. So any initial thoughts in terms of the SNAP rules -- SNAP rule changes that are going to go into effect next year? John Garratt : Yes. There's one that was in the news yesterday around able-bodied work requirements, which will take effect April 1, 2020. Based on what we know about this proposal, we don't see this as a material impact next year as we see it. This is something we continue to monitor closely. We've continued to see a long-term trend of reduced benefits over time gradually. But over that time, our share has grown as well. So we're still a little under 5% in terms of tender mix but are really focused on what we can control, and that's making sure we're prepared to serve those customers as they need us. Operator : The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the gross margin in general. So I know you've consistently said, and you've said it twice on this call, that second half gross margin will be similar to 2Q. So that implies kind of almost 30 basis point improvement in gross margin in the fourth quarter. So wondering if you could just provide a little color on why you'd see that improvement. And then you did call out shrink as a pressure point this quarter as well as distribution transportation, but can you elaborate a little bit on what was causing that? And has that got anything to do with the acceleration of the fresh initiative? John Garratt : Sure. I'll start by talking about gross margin. You're correct in the way you're thinking about the second half, that would imply and that's what we expect, is increased gross margin expansion in Q4. The reason we see more gross margin expansion in Q4 versus Q3. The 2 main drivers I would point to is, one, the acceleration of our strategic initiatives. As fresh scales, as NCI scales, we see that playing a bigger and bigger role.  The other piece is the promotional activity. We are lapping heightened promotional activity last year. It was targeted. It served its purpose, created a lot of momentum in the business, but we don't see a need to repeat that. And the team has done a really great job being very targeted in the promotional activity, really focused on what moves the needle, and we see ability to do less as a percent of sales this year. That's the 2 main things I would point to as well as just seeing other opportunities and the other levers that we mentioned there.  In terms of shrink, we've reduced shrink quite a bit over the last 3 years. But as we've said, it's never a straight line to the top. In Q3, we were lapping a very challenging lap. At the time, that was the lowest shrink rate we've had in many years. What we've been trying to do this year is balance shrink with in-stock improvement levels. We really look to take our in-stock improvement to the next level, which is great in terms of driving sales, but it does present a little bit more shrink exposure. But we continue to see opportunity over the long-term to drive further shrink improvement. And with the incorporation of the EAS units in all the stores by the end of the year, that's been a big benefit to us and we would expect benefits from that as well as leveraging all the other tools and technology and process rigor to drive that down further over the long term. Karen Short : So my follow-up would be then, as we look to 2020, just generally speaking, it would sound to me, barring anything unforeseen with respect to the competitive environment or the consumer, that the tailwind should be greater than the headwinds overall for next year. Is that fair? John Garratt : I'm not going to comment specifically on 2020, I'll just speak to the longer term. And what I would say is we feel like we have a lot of catalysts in place to drive the top line. As we've mentioned, we feel like we have a lot of levers within gross margin and SG&A to flow that through. We're very pleased with where we're at this year, delivering double-digit operating profit growth and EPS growth this quarter while reinvesting in the business. And as we look forward, we'll continue to look at that. We want to make sure that we're delivering strong performance, but at the same time, reinvesting in the business to protect the long-term health and growth of the business. So I would look at it that way. Operator : The next question is from Ed Kelly with Wells Fargo. Anthony Bonadio : This is Anthony on for Ed. Congrats on a solid quarter. So clearly, you guys continue to accelerate your share gains given the comp performance and your initial remarks. Can you just talk about what you're seeing right now in the competitive landscape? And then is there any specific channel that you think this is coming from? Or would you say it's been more broad-based? Todd Vasos : Yes. Let me start with the second piece. First is, I would say that it is more broad-based when you look at the share gains that we've seen. And our core consumer continues to be, again, a little bit healthy and that she has a bit more money in her pocket. But I would tell you that as we look out there, a lot of our initiatives are really the key driver behind these share gains and outsized share gains at that and accelerating. And you can really see it in many of the categories that we've really got the emphasis on health and beauty being one; our food and perishable initiatives, you can really see the initiatives really resonating with the consumer, and she's voting with her wallet on where she shops. And it's great to see. Now our goal is to continue to be a fill-in, and that is exactly how our consumers continue to look to us. But with expanding assortments and fabulous prices, we feel that we give her the opportunity to be able to fill in with confidence. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : My question is going to be a little bit of a devil's advocate on the fourth quarter implied gross margin. You've got a pretty easy compare. As you mentioned, you engage in some promotional activities in the year ago period that you're not going to repeat. You've got all these really good gross margin drivers like DG Fresh and the NCI initiative but yet you're only guiding for 30 basis points of gross margin expansion in 4Q to get to like a 31.5% gross margin, which would be below where you've been over the last few years, excluding 2018. So why wouldn't it be better than that? John Garratt : Yes. What I would say, Michael, is as you look at the squeeze on Q4 that, as Karen pointed out, that end point is a pretty healthy gross margin. But what I would tell you is that, one, there are some headwinds. We're overcoming tariffs. The team has done a phenomenal job mitigating that, such that it's not a material impact. It wasn't a surprise to us. But still, it is a pressure. And there's other pressures as well, as well as reinvesting in the business. That's the way we look at it, if we can deliver double-digit EPS growth, which is what our guidance implies, 10% to 11%, while reinvesting in the business to put more catalyst in place for long-term growth. We think that's a healthy balance between the 2. Michael Lasser : Okay. And my follow-up question is, it's very not -- very much not apparent from the financial performance that you've reported, but given all that you do have going on, have there been any hiccups with opening any of these new fresh DCs or engaging in NCI or opening new stores that we should be mindful about as you get further into executing some of these strategies over the next few quarters? Todd Vasos : Michael, this is Todd. I would tell you that the team has done a phenomenal job across the board on each of those initiatives you just talked about. And I would tell you that we have seen no show-stoppers. Obviously, there's always going to be a bump or 2, but they were very, very manageable. We learn from those and kept moving down the road. And I think it's a real testament to your question here is our notion that we're able to accelerate both our nonconsumable initiative into next year, of course, accelerating our -- and growing the Fresh initiative into next year with up to 5 different new facilities as we go into 2020. So I would tell you that there's been some learnings. But more -- a whole lot more wins than anything else that we've seen and has given us great confidence to move forward. Operator : The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Xian Siew Hew Sam : This is Xian Siew on for Simeon. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the top line momentum. Is there any kind of update on maybe basket size or the number of trips? And then, I guess, within that, you mentioned transactions are growing nicely. So are you gaining new customers? Or is it kind of the existing customer just coming more frequently? Todd Vasos : Yes. Thank you. Yes, I would tell you that our top line was very balanced. A very good mix of both traffic and ticket. And I would tell you that the average basket size has upticked a little bit over the last quarter or 2 as we continue to refine our offering and give our customers more choices, as we roll out DG Fresh to more stores. That also enables, again, an extra item in the basket, if you will. So we're very pleased with both traffic and ticket as we see it. As it relates to the consumer, we continue to see that our fastest-growing category of consumer, if you will, is that consumer making $50,000 or above, and we continue to believe that she's shopping more often because of all the work that we've done to refine that box and give her an offering at a great compelling price and she's liking what she sees when she tries us, and she's sticking with us even after the first few trials. So we're really excited about that. It gives us great confidence as we move into 2020 and beyond, that we can drive that top line. Xian Siew Hew Sam : Got it. That makes sense. And just as a follow-up, I guess, you're lapping this year in this quarter, the hurricane-related expenses you mentioned. And -- so you had some leverage, but maybe if you ex that out, I mean, there's not as much leverage on the SG&A. With comps came in so much stronger, I guess, why shouldn't we see more leverage on that? John Garratt : What I would say is that we're proud of the Q3 and year-to-date cost control that we've put in place while driving strong top line and investing in our strategic initiatives. Year-to-date, we've invested $33 million in our strategic initiatives yet in Q3 and year-to-date, leveraged on an adjusted basis. We're laser-focused on cost control, make me no mistake, but we're looking more broadly in operating profit and willing to make those trade-offs that deliver the bottom line. So we're pleased with delivering double-digit operating profit growth and delivering the double-digit rate increase making those trade-offs. But as you invest in things like DG Fresh, there is a trade-off between gross margin and SG&A. You have to spend a little bit more on SG&A to save a lot more on gross margin. And when you're at the front end of these initiatives, there's more upfront cost. But as these grow over time and scale, we see these having great returns. We mentioned in the call, we see DG Fresh as being accretive from a rate and dollar standpoint next year. So we believe that we're making the right trade-offs here and believe that if we could deliver that kind of leverage while investing in the business, that's the right trade-off for the long term. And we believe these types of investments is what positions us well to be double-digit EPS growers on an adjusted basis over the long term. Operator : The next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : John, I know you've bounced around this topic quite a bit today, but these all fell on margins. I guess, just kind of taking a step back, we have seen a fairly consistent pattern of the company making pretty sizable investments in the business over the last several years, whether it was price or training, labor initiatives, et cetera. And while there's been a nice payoff on the sales growth, these investments have weighed on profit growth and flow-through. So I guess what I'm wondering is, are there any areas, as you kind of sit here today, that seem ripe for incremental investments? John Garratt : Well, as we look ahead, I would tell you that there's nothing specific we see on the time horizon, which would be a substantial increase in investment. I think we've got 4 really good investments before us. Now those are going to scale. And as we grow those, more money will be spent on those. But as we've said, we see those hitting a tipping point : See DG Fresh hitting a tipping point where it's accretive next year; we're already seeing accretion from NCI; we're investing in digital; and we're investing in Fast Track. Fast Track on the labor side, we're seeing benefits there already with what we're doing with making it easier to stock the shelves. We're investing in self-checkout, which we see as a great return over the long term, but we're just starting there. So we're pleased with what we're seeing with that test right now in terms of adoption and customer feedback and see that returning over the long term. So these are various phases, but we see all of these providing catalysts to the top line but also helping the bottom line, helping that margin rate. And I would tell you, we're not giving any specific guidance for next year, but don't see any major investments on the horizon beyond continuing down the path we're on, which is working very well for us. Scot Ciccarelli : That's very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up here. You had seasonal goods that were up the same amount as consumables from a growth rate perspective. Just curious if there was something specific that drove that this particular quarter? Or is it a function of NCI program? Any kind of guidance on that? Because, obviously, it helped you sell a richer mix of goods. Todd Vasos : Yes. Sure. I would tell you that the team has done a great job in our seasonal programs. Not only seasonal, but many of our home categories are doing very well. And I would tell you that NCI has given us a nice shot in the arm as it relates to the overall top line. It's even gotten us to look at our everyday 16,000 stores a little differently as we continue to scale NCI. So I would tell you that that's really been the catalyst behind it, and we're very proud of the team's performance and our store team's performance in our nonconsumable categories. And the other note is apparel did very well, even in a downsizing mode that we're in, in apparel. We've made that even more productive. As we expand out on other categories, apparel is still important to our customers in certain areas, and we're capitalizing very well on that. Operator : The next question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : Todd, let me start with good-for-you assortment, right? Where does that stand now in terms of number of items? Where does that go, do you think, over the next year or 2? And is that helping you broaden out your demographic appeal? Todd Vasos : Yes. John, I would tell you that right now, we see our Better For You offering in about 5,400 stores. We see an opportunity to probably double that over time, and eventually into the majority of our stores. But everything we do here, as you know, it's through the lens of the consumer. And as the consumer continues to change and her preferences continue to change, and also as we start to see a little bit more of a millennial customer showing up, which we have, Better For You continues to grow with our customer base, and we're going to grow with it. The great thing is that we've got upwards of 20 feet worth of product today. The majority of that in our Better For You, Good & Smart label, which is our private brand label, which makes that very, very accretive for us. But I would tell you that as we continue to scale our fresh initiative, that more and more introductions into frozen, dairy, and deli will also fall into some Better For You-type categories and sales opportunities. And I agree with you fully, and what we've seen in our data shows it is expanding the reach of consumers that we have today and we'll continue to get into the future. John Heinbockel : All right. And secondly, I know the high-capacity coolers, right, 45% more holding capacity. When you think about the productivity, right, but the revenue or the volume that a high capacity cooler can do versus a non, is it similarly, 40%, 50% can do that much more business? Or it's really a function -- you've got to keep it stocked, so maybe it's not that high? Todd Vasos : Yes. I think that's the way to look at it. It does give us more revenue. I would tell you that for sure. Not at a 40% rate. But this is really being done twofold reasons. Number one, we are ensuring that we're in stock as we roll out our new Fresh initiative. We would rather have it in the cooler on the sales floor than any back stock in the back room in a cooler waiting to be stocked. That's number one. But it does give us 25% more item capability, and that's where you're going to see the increase in sales come from in this initiative. And I'm happy to say that the majority of the stores that we put in the ground new next year as well as our remodel and relos will have those higher-capacity coolers in them. So we feel real good, John, about where this is going to take us. Operator : The next question will come from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : Just, Todd, can we dig a little bit into NCI a little bit more? Just maybe the number of SKUs you're adding by store? What the lift you're seeing in, say, an individual store? And it seems like the gross margins are starting to nicely contribute. Maybe just sort of unpack that for us a little bit more? Because obviously, it's pretty important. You talk about the remodel look historically, but it sounds like NCI is something that we maybe could start to quantify? Todd Vasos : Yes. I would tell you that, Chuck, that we plan to quantify this a little bit more as we move into next year. But let me try to shape it up a little bit by saying that it is a complete redo of our nonconsumable categories in general. And I would tell you that the mix is vastly different in those stores than what you see in our traditional stores. On top of that, it gets refreshed multiple times a year in many of the areas of NCI, where our planograms are static, if you will, outside of season in our traditional stores. So it gives something fresh and new to the consumer every time she comes in. And again, she's been gravitating and resonating to that very, very well. I would tell you that it has been accretive to our remodel sales. Again, we'll quantify that probably a little deeper as we move forward. But both on the sales line and the gross margin rate line, we've seen benefits from this. And as that continues to grow, it will start to benefit the entire company as we continue to grow that. But the one point that I did want to again make is that we're taking some of those best of the best planogram learnings and rolling them back into the 16,000 store base, and that's really what's given us some of that strength that you've seen over the last quarter to 2 in our nonconsumable category. So we feel very good about where it's headed. And we're only in the third inning here of build to roll this out. Charles Grom : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up. Along with the potential margin savings from eliminating the middleman, one of the benefits from bringing fresh distribution in-house was, I believe, the ability to get better access to brands. So just wondering if you could elaborate on progress on that front and anything we should expect over the next couple of years. Maybe any specific brands that you've been able to bring in recently. Todd Vasos : Yes. Chuck, as we continue to scale fresh, it is a goal of ours to expand the brand offering in areas that our customers are looking for. A lot of it in the deli and frozen areas of the store. And the one big area that we see opportunities to move forward as well is even in our own private brand offering, which we were excluded to really play in any significant way in, and that would include Better For You as we continue to move forward. So that -- while that is a very important piece of the fresh initiative, the most important piece right now is getting the stores up and running seamlessly, making sure we're in stock for the consumer driving that in-stock rate, which will drive our sales higher, and we've already seen that. And then as we master that within the next upcoming year or more, we'll start to put in these new brands, which will also then help accelerate that top line in the fresh initiative. So we believe we've got a multiyear pronged approach to this that should drive that top line. Charles Grom : And just a quick follow-up. I think you said 5,500 stores. But anyhow, did you say how many you expect to be in by the end of 2020? Todd Vasos : Well, I think what we've said, Chuck, is that the pace of rollout is going to be very similar. We'll probably expand that a little bit more, but we plan to be in close to 12,000 or more stores by the time we leave 2020. Operator : And gentlemen, we have reached the top of the hour.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Dollar General's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, March 12, 2020. [Operator Instructions] This is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Donny Lau, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy. Mr. Lau, you may begin. Donny Lau : Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; Jeff Owen, our COO; and John Garratt, our CFO.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, capping off a strong year of performance across the company. Notably, our full year results include our best sales comp increase in 7 years, and double-digit diluted EPS growth. The quarter was highlighted by same-store sales growth of 3.2% despite the lap of an estimated 70 basis point sales comp benefit from the pull forward of SNAP payments into Q4 of last year, and double-digit growth in both operating profit and diluted EPS. We're especially pleased that we delivered strong operating margin performance this quarter, even as we continue to invest in key areas, including our strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position and support long-term sustainable growth. Overall, we are executing well against both our operating and strategic priorities, and believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth as we move forward. During today's call, I'll first recap some of the top line results for the fourth quarter and full year. John will then review our financial results in more detail as well as discuss our financial guidance for fiscal 2020. Afterwards, Jeff and I will provide an update on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, including some key actions we've taken that not only contributed to our strong results in 2019 but have also laid the groundwork for what we expect to be another solid year of performance in 2020. In the fourth quarter, net sales increased 7.6% to $7.2 billion compared to net sales of $6.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. We are particularly pleased with the balanced nature of our sales performance once again driven by meaningful contributions across many fronts, including sustained positive sales momentum across new stores and mature store base, strong same-store sales growth in both our consumable and non-consumable product categories and another quarter of strong growth in customer traffic and average basket size. Once again this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data, with mid- to high single-digit growth in both units and dollars over the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending January 25, 2020. Importantly, our market share gains continued to increase at an accelerated rate throughout these periods, which we believe speaks to the underlying momentum of the business.  For the full year, net sales increased 8.3% to $27.8 billion compared to net sales of $25.6 billion in 2018. Same-store sales for the year increased 3.9%, which, as I mentioned earlier, represents our best full year comp sales performance in 7 years and includes our highest increase in customer traffic since 2015. Notably, 2019 marked our 30th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. This underscores our belief that Dollar General's unique value and convenient proposition continues to resonate with our customers and speaks to the resiliency of our business model. Collectively, we view these results as further validation that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable more balanced and sustainable growth by creating meaningful long-term shareholder value. We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and are well positioned to advance our goal of further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape. Before I turn the call over to John, I want to note that we are following the coronavirus outbreak closely, and our thoughts are with everyone affected. As compared to some retailers, our direct import sourcing exposure is relatively limited, although many of our domestic vendors also source from other countries. We have limited insight into the extent to which our business may be impacted by this outbreak, and there are many unknowns. But we currently do not anticipate a material impact on fiscal 2020 results from anything that we have experienced to date. Of course, we are continuing to monitor the events closely. We are also mindful of those who were impacted by the devastating tornadoes that struck Nashville and surrounding areas last week, and we are actively working to support our people and this community. As I've said before, our business is built on people, and their health and safety will always be top priority. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the fourth quarter and full year, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, and all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.8% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 60 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to higher initial markups on inventory purchases and a lower LIFO provision. These factors were partially offset by increased markdowns as a percentage of sales, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category, sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category and increased distribution costs. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.7%, an increase of 13 basis points. These results were driven by increases in store occupancy costs, repairs and maintenance expenses and advertising costs. These items were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $11.6 million in hurricane and other disaster-related expenses compared to the 2018 fourth quarter. During the quarter, we invested approximately $20 million in SG&A expense attributable to our strategic initiatives. We are very pleased with the progress on each and continue to believe these investments position us well to deliver meaningful benefits to the business over both the intermediate and longer term. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 12.9% to $721 million compared to $639 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 10.1%, an increase of 47 basis points, which reflects another quarter of operating margin expansion despite continued investment in our strategic initiatives. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23% and compares to a rate of 21.2% in the fourth quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the fourth quarter increased 14.1% to $2.10. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong and balanced performance the team delivered during the quarter, which contribute to solid full year GAAP and adjusted EPS growth of 11.2% and 12.7%, respectively. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $4.7 billion at the end of the fiscal year, an increase of 14.2% overall and up 7.8% on a per store basis. We continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in great shape and remain focused over time on driving inventory growth that is in line with or below our total sales growth. For 2019, we once again generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $2.2 billion, an increase of $94 million or 4.4%. As a percentage of sales, operating cash flow was 8.1%. Total capital expenditures for the year were $785 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations; continued investments in construction of our Amsterdam, New York distribution center; and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $415 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $81 million. For the full year, we returned a total of $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments. At the end of the fourth quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.1 billion. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. Moving to our financial guidance for fiscal 2020. We expect another year of solid performance from our core business, fueled by a healthy balance of comparable sales growth and new store development. In addition, we anticipate positive gross profit contribution from our strategic initiatives, specifically our non-consumables initiative or NCI and DG Fresh. That said, we also expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives, in addition to the ongoing expenses associated with each as we continue to lay the foundation for long-term sustainable growth. With all that in mind, we expect the following for fiscal 2020. Net sales growth of 7.5% to 8%, same-store sales growth of 2.5% to 3%, and EPS growth of approximately 11.5% or approximately 10% compared to 2019 adjusted EPS and in line with our long-term goal of delivering double-digit EPS growth on an adjusted basis, while also continuing to invest for the long term. As a reminder, 2019 adjusted EPS excludes a $31 million pretax impact related to significant legal expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2019, as discussed in today's earnings release. Our EPS guidance assumes a fiscal 2020 effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 22.5%. Capital spending is expected to be in the range of $925 million to $975 million as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth.  With regards to shareholder returns, as we outlined in today's press release, our Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.36 per share, which represents an increase of 12.5%. We also plan to repurchase approximately $1.15 billion of our common stock this year. Finally, our 2020 outlook for real estate projects remains unchanged from what we discussed with you on our Q3 2019 earnings call. Let me now provide some additional context to our current expectations. As I noted earlier, we anticipate continued and meaningful investment in our strategic initiatives this year, including ongoing expenses associated with each. We continue to believe these investments will improve operating margin over time, particularly as the benefits to gross margin continue to scale and ultimately outpace the associate expense. NCI and DG Fresh are near-term examples of this dynamic, as we expect both will be accretive to operating margin in 2020. That said, these investments will continue to pressure SG&A rates this year as we accelerate their rollouts. With regard to tariffs, our guidance does not contemplate additional changes to tariff rates for products subject to tariffs beyond those which are currently in effect. Finally, as Todd mentioned, we are closely monitoring events related to the coronavirus, including potential impacts on our business. At present, although we anticipate delays on certain goods originating in China, we do not anticipate a material impact on our business or fiscal 2020 financial results and have not taken any such impact into account in our guidance. In summary, we are very pleased with our 2019 results and excited about our plans for 2020. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thank you, John. I want to take the next few minutes to update you on our 4 operating priorities, including our plan for 2020. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. To that end, the team is executing against a portfolio of initiatives designed to drive continued growth, while keeping the customer at the center of all we do. Let me highlight just a few. Our cooler door expansion program continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. Importantly, in addition to being a great sales and traffic driver, the expansion of our cooler door footprint over the years has provided the scale necessary to enable DG Fresh. In turn, given our DG Fresh learnings and successes to date, we recently began incorporating higher capacity coolers into our stores, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver a wider product selection. We expect to further capitalize on these opportunities with the plans to accelerate our growth of cooler doors in 2020. In fact, we expect to install approximately 55,000 additional cooler doors this year, which is about 10,000 more than we did in 2019, the majority of which will be in higher-capacity coolers as we continue to build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. Turning now to private brands, which continues to be a priority, as we pursue opportunities to further enhance our value proposition while also benefiting gross margin. We are especially pleased with our ongoing rebranding and repositioning efforts, which contributed to our strong results in 2019, including our highest private brand sales increase in 6 years. Standouts in 2019 included both our Studio Selection and Gentle Steps product lines, and we plan to expand each of these brands in 2020. We also believe there is significant opportunity with other brands as well. In fact, our plans this year include the rebranding of several additional product lines, including stationery, laundry, hardware, automotive, pet food and party. Also, in 2020, we plan to execute a redesign of Clover Valley, our largest and most successful private brand, which generated over $1 billion in sales in 2019 as we seek to drive overall category awareness and even greater customer adoption. In short, we're pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing across our portfolio of private brands and believe we are on the right track to deliver even greater value for our customers while continuing to drive profitable sales growth. I also want to highlight our Better For You offering, which continues to resonate with our core customers. As a reminder, this product line consists of a variety of Better For You options at low prices and is now available in approximately 5,600 stores, with plans to expand to more than 8,000 stores by the end of the year. Next, a quick update on our FedEx relationship, which provides customers with convenient access to FedEx package pickup and drop-off services. This service is currently available in more than 2,500 locations, with plans to expand to over 8,500 stores by year end, further advancing our long track record of serving rural communities. Importantly, we continue to explore innovative opportunities to serve our customers and are excited to be able to leverage our unique real estate footprint to provide solutions for them in convenient locations across the country. Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, we continue to focus on enhancing gross margin. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with our NCI, DG Fresh and private brand efforts, foreign sourcing continues to represent a significant opportunity for us. Our goals include increasing penetration and diversifying countries from which we source, and we are pleased with our progress on this front. In fact, we successfully reduced our direct sourcing exposure to China by approximately 7% in 2019 and are targeting a further reduction of an additional 7% in 2020. We are currently sourcing product from over 35 countries, up from 9 countries at the end of 2018 and expect to further increase our countries of origin this year as we continue to lay the foundation for ongoing success in this area. Additionally, while the team has made great progress in recent years, shrink reduction remains an important area of focus and opportunity. During 2019, we added more than 6,000 additional electronic article surveillance units, completing our rollout to the entire chain. Looking ahead, we plan to build on our success with EAS as we increase the number of products tagged, while further leveraging technology to drive even higher levels of in-store execution. We also continue to pursue distribution and transportation efficiencies. Reducing stem miles is an important contributor to these efforts and the successful opening of our Longview, Texas, and Amsterdam, New York distribution centers in 2019 is expected to drive additional efficiencies as we move ahead. Our plans also consist of the continued expansion of our private fleet in 2020 as we look to further reduce our dependency on third-party transportation carriers. Overall, we are pleased with the great work the team is doing across the business to further drive profitable sales growth and are excited about our plans for 2020.  Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk model for real estate growth continues to be a core strength of our business and enhances our ability to bring value and convenience to customers across the country. As a reminder, our real estate model continues to focus on 5 metrics that have served us well for many years in evaluating new real estate opportunities, including new store productivity, actual sales performance, average returns, cannibalization and the payback period. Of note, we continue to see very consistent performance across these metrics. And with average returns of 20% to 22%, we continue to believe new store growth is the best use of our capital. In 2019, we celebrated the grand opening of our 16,000th store and completed a total of 2,099 real estate projects, slightly more than we had initially anticipated. For 2020, we expect to open 1,000 new stores, remodel 1,500 stores and relocate 80 stores, representing nearly 2,600 real estate projects in total, or an average of 7 projects per day as we continue to deploy capital in these high-return investments. Importantly, we expect more than 1,100 of our remodels to be in the higher cooler count DGTP or DGT format, bringing our total number of stores in these formats to approximately 3,500 by year-end. The remainder of our remodels will primarily be in the traditional format, many of which will include the higher capacity coolers I mentioned earlier. We are also accelerating the expansion of our produce offering, which provides the top 20 items typically sold in traditional grocery stores and covers approximately 80% of the overall categories they carry. Our plans now consist of adding produce in approximately 400 stores this year, up from a previous goal of about 250 stores, bringing the total number of stores with produce to more than 1,000 by year-end. I am very proud of the team's ability to execute such high volumes of successful real estate projects, and we are excited about the continued growth opportunities ahead. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost-control mindset. At the store level, our operational initiatives for 2020 consists of building on our recent success with Fast Track, which Todd will discuss in more detail as well as ongoing efforts to simplify our operations by reducing unproductive inventory and operating complexity. As I highlighted earlier, we are also focused on improving distribution and transportation efficiencies, while at the store support center, work simplification and process improvement are ongoing initiatives to take costs out of the business. In addition to generating significant savings to date, this process has also produced other meaningful initiatives such as our 2019 partnerships with Western Union and FedEx and the income associated with these service offerings. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people, as we believe they are a competitive advantage. 2019 was a banner year in many ways, underscored by another record low in store manager turnover, following a record low the previous year. In addition, we continued to be pleased with our strong applicant flows and the length of time it takes to fill open positions, which we believe further demonstrates that our commitment to investing in our people is resonating in the communities we call home. I'm also pleased to announce, for the ninth consecutive year, Dollar General was included in Training magazine's top 125 list, placing #1 overall for the second year in a row. And while we are excited about these accomplishments, the team is already focused on additional opportunities to further develop our people in 2020, including enhancing our store manager training program to include even more hands-on learning, increasing the size of our assistant store manager development program and continuing to grow our private fleet driver training program, including the funding and facilitation of training for employees to obtain their commercial driver's license. In addition, we continually strive to create opportunities for people to grow and develop at Dollar General. As a result, more than 12,000 of our current store managers were promoted from within and internal placement rates remain strong across the organization. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. In summary, we are executing well and making great progress against each of our operating priorities. We have a robust set of initiatives in place for 2020 and are confident in our plans to drive continued growth in the years ahead. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Jeff. I'm very proud of the progress the team has made in advancing our key strategic initiatives. Let me take you through some of the most recent highlights as well as our plans for 2020.  Starting with our non-consumable initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of an enhanced and expanded product offering in key non-consumable categories. The NCI offering was available in approximately 2,400 stores at the end of 2019, and our plans include accelerating the rollout to a total of about 5,000 stores by year's end. We're especially pleased with the sustained positive sales and margin performance we are seeing across our enhanced non-consumable product categories. We also continue to see a positive halo effect in consumable sales. Overall, this performance is contributing an additional 1% to 2% increase in total sales comp compared to a typical remodel as well as a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate in these stores. And while the NCI store count is still relatively small compared to our overall store base, we are realizing additional benefits by leveraging learnings from these stores. Specifically, we are incorporating select NCI products and full planograms throughout the broader store base, resulting in positive sales and margin contributions across the entire chain. Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic multi-phase shift to self-distribution of our frozen and refrigerated goods. These goods currently represent approximately 8% of our total sales. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items by removing the markup paid to third-party distributors, thereby enhancing gross margin. And while, as expected, this cost of goods benefit was more than offset by initial start-up costs and associated operating expenses in 2019, we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. In fact, as John mentioned, we expect DG Fresh will be accretive to operating margin in 2020, as the benefits begin to exceed associated expenses and grow in the years ahead as we continue to scale this transformational initiative. Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories by enabling the accelerated rollout of our higher-capacity coolers, increasing in-stock levels and eventually, expanding our overall assortment offering. This could include a wider selection of both national and private brands as well as an enhanced offering of Better For You items.  And while produce is not included in our initial rollout plans, we believe DG Fresh could eventually provide a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more stores in the future. In total, we are currently self-distributing product to more than 6,000 stores from 5 DG Fresh facilities. Our goal for 2020 is to capture benefits from DG Fresh in approximately 12,000 stores or about double the current store count from up to 10 facilities by year's end. In short, we're very pleased with the results we are seeing from this initiative and excited about the potential long-term benefits it can deliver for our customers and our business. Next, our digital initiative, where our efforts remain focused on deploying and leveraging technology to further enhance the customer in-store experience. Our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem that is specifically tailored to providing our core customer with even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. To date, many of our efforts are centered on further enhancements to the Dollar General mobile app, which now includes digital coupons, a shopping list feature, our car calculator in-app shopping and budgeting tool, and DG GO! mobile checkout, now available in approximately 750 stores, with plans for further expansion as we look to combine this feature with self-checkout in select stores as we move ahead, providing for even more convenient checkout solutions. Our digital offering is clearly resonating as we added 1.5 million users to our monthly active user base on our mobile app, ending the year with 3,000 -- I'm sorry, 3.3 million monthly active users, an 83% increase over prior year. Importantly, we know digitally engaged customers checkout with baskets twice as large as the company average. We also recently launched a pilot of DG Pickup, which is our buy online, pickup in the store offering. DG Pickup is currently available in approximately 30 stores, and we are well positioned to scale quickly, pending the outcome of our pilot results. By leading our channel in digital experiences, we believe we can continue to drive in-store traffic, grow basket size and offer even greater convenience to both new and existing customers within our channel. Moving now to Fast Track, where our goal will include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. The first component of Fast Track is streamlining the stocking process in our stores through rolltainer optimization, which we have now completed at each of our distribution centers with even more shelf-ready packaging. These efforts are designed to reduce the amount of time spent stocking shelves during the truck unloading and restocking process, and we're very pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are already seeing. Importantly, we are also seeing increased sales, higher in-stock levels and lower store manager turnover in the initial stores that received optimized rolltainers, which positions us well to drive additional benefits as we move forward. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which we believe can further improve speed of checkout while also reducing the amount of labor hours devoted to the checkout activity. We are currently testing self-checkout in a small sample of stores and are pleased with the early results, including positive feedback from both customers and employees. We believe this offering will not only further enhance our convenience proposition for customers, but also drive even greater efficiency in the store. To summarize, 2019 was a noteworthy year for Dollar General as we delivered strong results and made significant progress with our strategic initiatives, while further laying the groundwork for further initiatives and long-term sustainable growth. As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are constantly evaluating what lies ahead for our customers and our business and continue to believe we are pursuing the right strategies to capture additional growth opportunities in an evolving retail landscape. In closing, I am proud of the team's performance and our 2019 results, which demonstrates strong and disciplined execution across many fronts, including a multitude of complex projects. And with the plans we have in place, including continued investment, we are excited about our ability to sustain this growth in 2020 and over the long term. I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our approximately 143,000 employees across the company for their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. As a team, we look forward to 2020, as we look to build on our strong performance from 2019. With that, operator, we'd now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Congrats on another strong quarter. So just with the coronavirus, just curious what you guys are seeing related to it in recent days? And what type of changes in consumer behavior are you seeing in store currently? Todd Vasos : Yes, Rupesh, we are, like probably other retailers, seeing a stock-up phenomenon happening over the last 1.5 weeks to 2 weeks, accelerated into this week a little bit more. So we're continuing to watch that closely. I'm really proud of our store teams with the additional volume, how they've taken care of our customers and our supply chain teams making sure that we have stock in the store for those customers that come in. It is our hope, as we move through this, we're able to satisfy the customer need as they continue to shop with us. We're watching it closely as well because like most stock-ups, there's always a backside to this. So we're watching that as we continue to move through the next few weeks with the hope that this virus will diminish over time. And obviously, we'll see the back end. But we'll keep everybody posted as we move forward. Our goal internally here, again, is to ensure we deliver for our core consumer. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then one follow-up question. So you guys, again, very positive commentary on some of the market share gains you're seeing. Just given some of your initiatives with DG Fresh and the non-consumable initiatives, any shift in where you're seeing those share gains coming from versus recent quarters? Todd Vasos : As you take a look at what we've been able to post in 2019 and, let's be honest, even in years prior, we're really taking share from across the board in many respects. Obviously, DG Fresh has accelerated some of that -- those share gains coming from different disciplines as well that are out there. But the great thing is that DG Fresh is scaling exactly where we thought it would. Our teams have done a fabulous job. As you can imagine, this is a very complex project to roll out. But in true DG fashion, we're rolling that out at a very, very high level of execution. So we're looking forward to additional gains in traffic and customer counts as we continue to scale that. And then the NCI piece is another one that we're seeing some very good traction from on our non-consumable side. We posted our best non-consumable sales last year that we've seen in the last 4 to 5 years, and a lot of it has to do with a lot of the work that the team has put in within our non-consumable initiative. And the important thing here is scaling it very quickly up to 2,400 stores and soon to be 5,000 by year's end. But the most important thing is we've been able to take the learnings from that and move it back to the entire chain so that we saw a great benefit as we move through 2019. We expect the same in 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on a really nice quarter. Todd, maybe to take a step back, can you talk to the current health of the low-income consumer, maybe what you're seeing in the competitive environment? And just anything to consider in terms of the anticipated quarterly cadence of comps as we think about the progression of the year? Todd Vasos : Sure. As we see the core customer, as you know, we talk to her each and every quarter. Leading into Q1, so coming out of Q4, our core customer was in really good shape and continues to be in good shape, probably not much -- not very different than what we saw her coming out of Q2 and into Q3. Now, obviously, with the coronavirus setting in, we're watching that very carefully. We'll be talking to our core consumers here in the next couple of weeks to understand exactly how she's feeling as she now moves through our Q1 and dealing with the coronavirus. But I would tell you that everything was all systems go as far as we were concerned leading into this virus. So we anticipate that our core consumer will be in pretty good shape. And I think it really goes to show you the -- some of the stock-up sales that we've seen early on here, as I mentioned earlier, our core consumer is doing a lot of that, and she has the means to do it. And I think that's an important note to take away is that in years past, she might not have had that luxury or that opportunity. From an environment standpoint, I would tell you that the promotional environment is very, very stable, again, very much like we saw it all the way through 2019. And we feel fabulous about where our everyday pricing is on the shelf. We're in very, very good shape. And again, probably some of the best that we've seen in -- really, since I've been here for over 11 years. So we're in very, very good shape there. So right now, we feel good about that customer, we're watching it closely. And John, you may want to talk about the cadence. John Garratt : Yes. In terms of sales, I'll start by saying, we feel as good about this business as I've ever felt, I think Todd would agree. The initiatives are firing on all cylinders. So we expect strength throughout the year. Now, obviously, there's some lapping differences. As you move through the year, the lap gets a little tougher, Q3 in particular. As Todd mentioned, Q1, obviously, over the last 2 weeks, we've seen the stock-up he mentioned. But as he also mentioned, it remains to be seen whether that is just timing or whether that is permanent because we tend to see that average out over time. So more to come on that. But overall, anticipate a really strong year for sales and feel very good about the guidance provided. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow-up, John, maybe on the gross margin. Help us to think about some of the puts and takes to consider in 2020? And any material difference between your first and second half of the year embedded gross margin assumptions? John Garratt : Yes. As you look at gross margin, I'll start by saying we're very pleased with where we're at right now, ending the year with 60 basis points expansion, 14 basis points of expansion in the year, coupled with strong comp in traffic growth. As you look across the year, the things that helped Q4 we expect to continue. The biggest driver in Q4 we've called out with higher initial markups, and DG Fresh was the biggest driver of that. And as Todd mentioned, with DG Fresh and NCI, we're very pleased with what we're seeing there, and we continue to see those benefits grow as we move forward. And NCI has that added benefit of helping the non-consumables across the system as we take the best ideas and implement them elsewhere and again, having the best year this year in non-consumables that we had in 4 or 5 years. We see other opportunities to expand our gross margin. We're very pleased with what we saw in private brands this quarter, with the actions we've put in place. We're getting traction in direct and foreign sourcing, on supply chain as the market has stabilized. We've done a lot of great work there to take advantage of that and driven efficiencies there. In shrink, with the investment we made in the EAS units in the latter part of the year, adding 6,000 units. As we hit those inventories later in the year, that should help. And then, of course, you have just the great relationships we have with our vendors and the scale we have with our low SKU model count. So when you put all these together, we feel good about our ability to enhance our gross margin over the long term. There's a lot of levers here. Now we always reserve the right to invest in price when appropriate to drive share. But currently, we're in a great spot on price and happy with results. So feel good about where we're at. We'll make trade-offs throughout the year, as we mentioned. We are investing some SG&A to drive gross margin, but feel that positions us very well, not only for this year, but to drive that double-digit EPS growth we strive for over the long term. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Todd, I know you don't have a ton of stores in the Pacific Northwest. But if you look at areas that -- where the coronavirus is spreading more rapidly or in areas where you saw that initial stock-up take place, are you starting to see a slowdown in sales in those areas, either because consumers are engaging in social distancing, or because that's stockpiling just pulled forward some sales? And as part of that, you have a unique customer base and a unique value proposition where you're feeding fill-in trips and you have a lot of rural locations. So do you think your customer, given those characteristics, might just -- you'll be less exposed because your customer either needs your store more often or will engage in less social distancing because they live in rural areas? Todd Vasos : Yes, Michael, thanks for the question. As we look at what's transpired over the last couple of weeks, we've seen a pretty good balance of shopping acceleration across the 44 -- 45 states now that we operate in, and really not specific to the Pacific Northwest. Now as you indicated, though, we are less exposed out there just because of really just growing that store count in California, Oregon and Washington, obviously. So we're less exposed out there, but seeing the sales really across the board. As far as the social distancing is concerned, I think it is key to point out, and it's not lost on us, obviously, that we're within 5 to 7 miles of the majority of the United States, over 75%, if you will. We are in all these rural communities. But I think the most important thing here is that we're a small-box shop close to your home. And I think in times like this where people are probably less apt to travel, we believe that we'll get our fair share of that consumer base because they just don't want to travel to the big box or don't want to travel great distances. So we're watching that very closely. And I think that phenomenon, if play out, we'll be probably in the upcoming weeks as we see this virus continue to unfold. Michael Lasser : Okay. Then -- and Todd, I know you have a lot on your plate, if that wasn't enough, one of your competitors has recently talked about being more promotional. So do you expect to respond to this with increased promotional activity? And what are the chances that there could be an extended period of heightened promotions within the small-box value discount retail sector? Todd Vasos : Yes, Michael, we watch all retailers, whether it's directly in our space or in the other areas of drug, grocery or mass retailing. I would tell you, and we track it closely, as you can imagine, we don't see a great deal of promotional activity across the board. There's always a skirmish here or there, if you will, in certain DMAs but that's always there, right? And we're squarely focused on controlling what we can control. And we feel we're in a great spot on everyday price, on our promotional cadence that we have out there, and we continue to distance ourselves from our nearest competitors. And that's really what we're focused on. And I think we're delivering on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : My first question is on implied EBIT margins. They look down a little bit in 2020. Is that fair? And can you walk through some of the puts and takes? And bigger picture, I'm a little surprised given that DG Fresh is going to be accretive, that the overall EBIT margin is going to be down. So we can talk about -- so can we talk about some of the puts and takes, please? John Garratt : Yes. I think when you look at the guidance provided on the top line and the bottom line guiding towards the approximately 10% EPS growth, I think that suggests a pretty healthy operating profit or EBIT growth on top of a very healthy one this year. And I would say, what we're focused on right now is striking a healthy balance between the near-term and the long term. We are investing in SG&A, investing a little bit SG&A to save more gross margin over time. And as we said, Fresh and NCI are going to be accretive this year, but we continue to invest in these initiatives as they scale. But again, we think that's the right trade-off for the long term. And as we come into the year, it's the beginning of the year, there are some uncertainties. You have the uncertainty around coronavirus, election cycle and what that may mean to the macros. But as Todd has said, we believe we're very well positioned in that event -- unfortunate event of a downturn. Delivering 30 straight years of consecutive same-store sales growth, I think, it just shows the resiliency of the model. And I think we're very well positioned to serve our customers, as he mentioned. So feel good about the guidance provided and feel we're striking a healthy balance between the near-term and the long term with our eye on continuing to deliver sustainable double-digit EPS growth over the long term. Simeon Gutman : And my follow-up is also on DG Fresh. If you think about the gross margin drivers for 2020, you're probably not going to quantify it, but does it make sense that DG Fresh would be at the top of the list in terms of initial markups, like it was in the fourth? And then now that you have a little bit more learnings from the initial rollout, can you help or comment on sizing the long-term EBIT margin opportunity from it? John Garratt : Yes, I'll start by saying that you're correct in thinking that DG Fresh is the biggest -- as I mentioned, there's a lot of drivers to help gross margin, but DG Fresh is the biggest one to point to this year. In terms of sizing that, I think a couple of data points we've provided is that it's about 8% of our business and it's a growing piece of our business. And as mentioned, it was the leading driver of the leading item we called out in our gross margin expansion for the quarter. So feel good about where we're at and feel good about what it can contribute, and not just on gross margins, but sales as well. I think that's the other thing to point to is we see it as a sales driver as well. As we remodel stores, add the coolers, that provides a very sizable sales bump. And we think as we can improve the assortment, improve the in-stock, and as we said before, historically, our in-stock on the frozen refrigerated side of the business has lagged dry by 10 points. There's a very strong correlation, as you know, between in-stock and sales. And so we see that as a benefit as we close that gap as well as the ability to improve the assortment in the store, providing more Better For You options along with that, including produce. We think, longer term, this is the unlock for produce. So we think it pencils very well and is delivering exactly what we thought it would in terms of as we convert items in stores is delivering that sizable cost takeout that we targeted. But longer term, we see it as a big sales driver, too. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Mandeville with Jefferies. Chris  Mandeville: John, just to kind of follow-up on the overall guidance here. If I look at your comp guide of 2.5% to 3%, I could simply hold the 2-year or 3-year stack for that matter and come out above that range. So I think you guys are talking about being in a position of strength and receiving momentum. You've got 75 additional stores entering the comp base versus last year, additional cooler expansion, Fast Track and Fresh are already seeing improvements in on-shelf availability, and then you've got some near-term benefit from the coronavirus, so basically the consumables category. Unless maybe we're missing something in terms of a temporary uplift in '19 from maybe competitive closures, can you just help us understand why we should only be looking for a 2.5% to 3% comp? John Garratt : Well, I'll start by saying that we feel great where we're at right now, coming off a year with a 3.9% full year sales comp. As we've said before, this model works very well with sales comps in the range of 2% to 4%. We were at the high end of that. Now obviously, as we come into the year, that's a tough lap, but I can tell you, as I said before, we feel as good as ever about the strength of the business model, the fundamentals and the initiatives. But we also mentioned, there are some near-term uncertainties with what the coronavirus, election cycle may mean to macro impacts, but we're focused on controlling what we can control and delivering profitable sales growth and feel like we have great initiatives in place. And with the guidance provided, we're comfortable with it, and it implies a quite healthy 2-year stack. Chris  Mandeville: Okay. And then I guess my follow-up would be as it relates to just operating expenses. With the strategic initiatives, is there any way of framing up the start-up costs that we should expect in '20 versus '19? And then just on distribution and freight, be it that they're in different line items, just given the notable decline in crude of late, is there any way of also kind of sizing up that potential benefit on the margin? John Garratt : Sure. I'll start with your question on SG&A. And I think that's a fair comment that as we shift into scaling these, the cost shifts from start-up costs to ongoing operating costs. And I think the perfect example of that is DG Fresh. As we scale that, we have to continue to invest a little bit of labor in the stores to save a lot of product cost. So it's a virtual -- it's a virtuous cycle as this grows, and it's accretive. We expect it to be accretive this year and net benefit grows as we get more and more efficient. You still do have some start-up costs and some inefficiencies as you start-up new DCs, as you remodel stores for NCI, as we work on digital. But increasingly, it shifts more toward ongoing expenses, which I would really classify more as geography between gross margin savings and SG&A with gross margin exceeding -- gross margin savings continuing to pull away from the SG&A, providing more and more of a benefit as we move forward. So I think that's the right way to think about that. And it's a healthy trade-off. In terms of distribution and transportation costs, there, too, is a little bit of geography. If you look at our distribution costs, we called that out as a drag this quarter, not a significant one. But really, the reason for that is as we incur additional costs, as we take over the cost of distributing fresh and frozen refrigerated goods. But again, the product cost savings that comes out of that far exceeds the labor and the distribution costs. So if you strip out the impact of taking that additional cost on, as a percent of sales year-over-year, our distribution and transportation costs were lower. And what I would point to on that is several things. The team has done a great job of expanding, diversifying our carrier base and as the market improved, has been able to take advantage of that with better rates. We've also expanded our private fleet, and we'll continue to do so this year, primarily around the new Fresh DCs. We just opened 2 new DCs, which helps the -- reduce the stem miles as well as other efforts to reduce stem miles, load optimization and warehouse efficiencies. So when you strip out that extra cost that we're picking up, that net-net is favorable, the team is doing a great job to drive efficiencies on distribution and transportation. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Great results. A heck of the data report. So let's maybe start with your real estate projects. 1,000 new stores, obviously, you've continued to have really good results out of the new boxes. Maybe just touch a bit more on that. And from your vantage point, how many years of additional 1,000 store openings do you kind of foresee? And then on the remodel front, the majority of your remodels are going into that higher cooler count format. How should we think about the opportunity there. I think you mentioned about 3,500 by year-end. What's the runway? Todd Vasos : Yes, sure, Paul. Yes, we feel very good about our real estate program. It is one of Dollar General's core strengths, and we continue to execute at a very, very high level. As you indicated, we're very pleased with the results we saw in 2019, and it was just another year of adding on to great results, even from past years. We still see an opportunity to -- in the Continental United States to put a Dollar General in about 12,000 locations. And so there's still a lot of runway there. DG Fresh, honestly, opens up some runway for us as well because of being able to scale our cooler counts and associated product sales, including produce, so it opens it up. And we, with all the metrics that we follow on our new stores, continue to run at a very, very high rate on the top of what we see as far as a return of 20% to 22%. So again, very, very strong, and we see that 2020 should be the same. And we've come out of the shoot very strong in the early days here. As it relates to the higher cooler count, this is, again, just a continuation of how we see coolers and the associated sales with that. As I've mentioned before, and I still truly believe, we're still somewhere in that fifth inning of a 9-inning ballgame on cooler counts and be able to really leverage that. And again, DG Fresh will be a big, big unlock as we continue to roll that out. These higher-capacity coolers can contain and will contain 25% more items and it holds, in totality, 44% more product. So the holding power is greater and reduces out of stocks, which increases sales. So again, we're very, very happy with our decisions to move to that, and I believe you'll start to see those benefits in 2020 and beyond. So again, very, very happy. The team has done a great job in executing and we see the same as we go into '20 here. Paul Trussell : My follow-up is just on the Pickup test. How is that working so far in the, I believe you mentioned 30 stores, that it's being tested in? What are you looking for from a metric standpoint? And when you say can scale quickly, what does that potentially equate to? Todd Vasos : Sure. Well, again, early days, Paul. 30 stores up and running. But the great thing here is, our IT team and our operating teams collectively stood this up in less than 1 year. And the app is very, very intuitive. It's great. I use the app myself, and I've seen others -- other competitors that have the app. And I would tell you that ours is as good, if not better, than most of those. Early on, we're seeing about what we thought we would see. We're seeing some conversion from existing customers, but probably some new customers as well. The great thing is our repeat customer, based on this, is at a very high level, much higher than we thought. So that's a very good sign that, one, she enjoyed the experience; and two, in some of these newer customers, we're getting repeat newer customers as well. So we're going to continue to monitor that very closely. We think that's one of the key metrics, are we actually attracting a new customer overall? And so we'll watch that as we go. A couple of points just to think about here is the average items, as running about 7 to 8 to 9 items, somewhere in there, which is not too dissimilar to what a full checkout experience average is for our core consumer. And the dollar amount is running about $3 to $5 more, depending on the transaction than our normal. So again, we're a fill-in, as we've always mentioned, and she's using this DG Pickup, at least so far early on in 30 stores, as additional fill-in. Now as it relates to scaling. We've said this before, we're going to take this slow. But if our consumers continue to resonate the way they have, we're going to be able to turn the dial up as quickly as we believe we should to scale this appropriately with the appropriate return against it. But we're only going to go as fast as the consumer wants us to go, and also only as fast as our execution levels will allow us. We're very disciplined along those lines and we'll continue to be. But the great thing here is, we believe, is a real competitive advantage for us, especially in our channel. Operator : Our final question will come from Karen Short with Barclays Bank. Karen Short : Just one clarification. I know this has kind of been asked in various different ways, but I just want to be clear. You do believe that the gross margin benefit from all these initiatives will build throughout the year, correct? But the idea is we have to keep in mind, SG&A will also be a little elevated, leading to the slightly negative EBIT margins. Is that the right way to think about it? John Garratt : Karen, that is the right way to think about that. As we scale these, we see the benefit of DG Fresh, NCI continue to grow. But again, that is partly as you have the investment cost associated with that. But it continues to be more and more accretive as you move forward and you reach scale. Karen Short : Okay. And then so switching to the virus. I mean obviously, every day is a new day. But it does seem likely we'll be in a much weaker macro for potentially several quarters. Could you maybe discuss how -- I mean, obviously, you are very resilient as a box. And -- but can you maybe discuss how you might perform in a weaker macro today, and how it might differ from '08, '09? I'd say in the context of comps, especially because I think there are many investors who are using '08, '09 as a proxy for how you might be comping in a weaker macro, and I think there's maybe a few issues with that as it relates to the comparability. So anything you could talk to you on that? Todd Vasos : Sure. Obviously, we're watching the virus, as I mentioned earlier, very closely. And if it does lead to a weaker macro environment, we feel we're very well positioned to capture those opportunities as they come. As it relates to 2008 and '09 compared to today, well, we're a much different shop today than we were. In '08 and '09, we were fixing the railroad, raising our gondola heights, doubling our SKU count, a lot of different things that drove those comps, probably to a little bit more of an outstretched comp than what you might see in a downturn in today's environment. But in saying that, we still believe very strongly that we're well positioned in a downturn from the product offering that we have as well as the customer that we serve. And also, we know from '08, '09, which we don't believe this will change is that trade-down customer will come into the box as well. And the great thing about that is maybe she visited us back in '08 and '09, and some, obviously, may not have come back. When she comes back, she's going to see a completely different box that's even more enhanced than she saw before. So we'll watch it carefully, but we think we're well positioned as we move forward here. Karen Short : Okay. And then just my last question is, can you just give an update on the comp waterfall from new units and remodels. Is it still kind of the 200 to 250 in range? Or is it -- maybe just an update there? John Garratt : Yes. Just to clarify, what we've said is actually 150 to 200. Now that is net of cannibalization, which has been very consistent as expected. And so as you think about that 150 to 200 basis point range, we have been running at the high end of that as we've seen, not only great results from the stepped-up new units, but just see -- continue to see great results from the remodels, particularly where we have the extra cooler count presence. So towards the high end of the 150 to 200 is the way to think about that. Operator : This concludes today's conference.

In recognition of the essential work performed by our employees in April, the New York Stock Exchange recognized one of our store managers, Crystal Burroughs, during the #Gratitude campaign, where the exchange join millions of others in honoring the way people on the front lines have responded to the COVID-19 crisis. As one of America's essential retailers, we are committed to being part of the solution during these difficult times, and are continuing to support these efforts through our expansive network of more than 16,000 store locations currently located within 5 miles of more than 75% of the U.S. population. Our convenient small box format, providing for a quick in-and-out access and limited crowds, both of which are conducive to social distancing. Our broad assortment of everyday household essential items, our ongoing commitment to everyday low prices, our flexible supply chain, our growing digital capabilities and recent measures taking to further safeguard the well-being of both our team members and customers and of course, our talented and committed associates.  For more than 80 years, Dollar General has served customers through a unique combination of value and convenience, and we will continue to be there for them in both good and challenging times. Let me now highlight some of the key actions we've taken in response to COVID-19 with 2 key priorities in mind. First is the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities we serve. Second is maintaining the continuity of our business and operations.  For our employees and customers, we took swift and proactive action to keep them safe, while keeping stores open and running with minimal disruption. We closed 1 hour early to allow greater time for stocking and enhanced cleaning protocols, distributed masks and gloves to all employees, implemented social distancing measures in our stores, distribution centers and at-the-store support center, and completed the installation of nearly 40,000 plexiglass barriers at checkout across the entire chain. To further support heightened demand, we have hired over 50,000 people since mid-March, nearly double our normal hiring rate. We are happy to welcome these new employees to our team, and our hiring efforts are continuing. We also invested approximately $60 million in employee appreciation bonuses and provided enhanced benefits and resources, including expanded paid leave and greater access to telehealth services. And we contributed to our employee assistance foundation to assist our coworkers during times of need. All these actions have helped to ensure the continuity of our business at a time when customers need us most. To support our communities, we dedicated the first hour of each day to seniors and provided a discount for first responders, medical personnel and National Guard members. And through the Dollar General Literacy Foundation, Save the Children, an organization working to ensure children in rural America continue to learn and have access to nutritious food during nationwide school closures, will receive a $2 million donation.  Beyond these actions, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we look to further meet the evolving needs of our customers and better position Dollar General to emerge from this crisis even stronger than before.  Turning now to our first quarter performance. The quarter was highlighted by extraordinary growth in both top and bottom lines. These results reflect significant changes in shopping patterns, which began in March as consumers reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the month of February, same-store sales increased 5.5%, driven by broad-based performance across many fronts, which we believe speaks to the continued strength and sustained momentum of the underlying business.  Beginning in March, we experienced a significant surge in demand and sales as consumers began to stock up, and category mix shifted even more than usual to our consumable category. For the month in total, comp sales increased 34.5%. April sales moderated in comparison to March, but remained elevated as consumers continue to replenish household essentials at a rate greater than normal. During April, we also experienced significant growth in our nonconsumable businesses. And our 3 nonconsumable categories delivered a combined comp sales increase in excess of our consumable business. For the month in total, same-store sales increased 21.5%. Overall, first quarter net sales increased 27.6% to $8.4 billion, driven by comp sales growth of 21.7%, including significant growth in average basket size and a meaningful increase in customer traffic.  Once again, this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data. Importantly, our data suggests a meaningful increase in new customers, underscoring the broadening appeal of our value and convenience proposition.  We're particularly pleased that we delivered a significant operating margin expansion this quarter, which contributed to diluted EPS of $2.56, an increase of 73% over prior year. Collectively, these results reflect our commitment to doing everything we can to support our employees, customers and communities during this time and further validates our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to create meaningful long-term shareholder value.  We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and having established an even stronger bond with the existing customers during these unprecedented times. Combined with the actions we've taken to forge new customer relationships, we believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth, even in what's expected to be a challenging economic environment. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to echo Todd's gratitude to our employees and note that my thoughts are with those who've been impacted by this crisis.  Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the first quarter, let me take you through some of the financial details. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year and all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 30.7% in the first quarter, an increase of 49 basis points. The gross profit rate increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales and higher initial markups on inventory purchases. These factors were partially offset by increased distribution costs, which were driven by increased volume and our decision to incur discretionary bonus expense.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 20.5%, a decrease of 204 basis points. Although we incurred certain incremental costs related to COVID-19, these costs were more than offset by the significant increase in sales. Expenses that were lower as a percentage of net sales this quarter include : Occupancy costs, retail labor, utilities, depreciation and amortization and taxes and licenses. These items were partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense.  Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the first quarter increased 69.2% to $867 million compared to $512 million in the first quarter of 2019. As a percentage of net sales, operating profit was 10.3%, an increase of 253 basis points. We believe the impact of COVID-19 significantly benefited operating profit in Q1, primarily through higher sales, partially offset by approximately $80 million of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including approximately $60 million in appreciation bonuses and nearly $20 million in measures taken to further protect the health and safety of our employees and customers, as well as enhanced benefits programs to support our store associates, distribution center employees and private fleet drivers.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% and compares to 20.8% in the first quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted earlier, EPS for the first quarter increased 73% to $2.56.  Turning now to our cash flow and balance sheet, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to better support our customers, employees during these difficult times. The business generated significant cash flow from operations during the quarter, totaling $1.7 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion or 202%. This increase was primarily driven by strong operating performance, combined with lower levels of inventory as we continue to work closely with suppliers to improve in-stocks for high-demand products. Merchandise inventories were $4.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, essentially flat to prior year and a decrease of 5.5% on a per-store basis. Total capital expenditures in the first quarter were $195 million, and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations and spending related to our strategic initiatives.  During the quarter, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock for $63 million, and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $91 million. At the end of Q1, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.1 billion. In light of the COVID-19 uncertainty, and out of an abundance of caution, we proactively took steps during the quarter to further bolster our already strong liquidity position, including the temporary suspension of share repurchases and the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior notes on April 3. These measures, along with our strong cash flow, put us in an even stronger liquidity position with $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion of availability under our undrawn revolving credit facility at the end of Q1.  Importantly, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases when it is prudent to do so and quarterly dividends, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA.  Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2020. Let me start by acknowledging the inherent and significant uncertainty that continues to exist around the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. In addition, the timing, scope and impact of both current and anticipated stimulus legislation and other governmental responses to the pandemic remains to be seen. As a result, it is difficult to predict specific outcomes. And while we expect to exceed our prior guidance for fiscal 2020 net sales, same-store sales and EPS, we are unable to estimate the extent of such upside with reasonable accuracy.  Accordingly, we are withdrawing our sales, earnings and share repurchase guidance for fiscal 2020 that was issued on March 12, 2020, in conjunction with our Q4 earnings call. With regards to share repurchases, we are constantly evaluating our position and intend to resume our share buyback activity when it is prudent and advisable to do so, which may be as early as the 2020 second quarter. Finally, our 2020 outlook for capital spending and real estate projects remain unchanged from what we issued in our Q4 earnings release on March 12, 2020.  Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our full year outlook. Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends, thus far, in May. Since the end of Q1 and through May 26, we have continued to experience elevated consumer demand in our stores, albeit with some intermittent moderation and in particular, over some of the more recent days. Overall, same-store sales have increased by approximately 22% during this time frame. That said, it is important to note that there are a number of factors which suggest that sales will moderate to more normalized levels beginning during the latter part of Q2, including the duration and impact of shelter-in-place restrictions and social distancing measures, the gradual reopening of other retailers, the tapering of benefits included in recent stimulus legislation and managing through what is likely to be a more challenging economic environment for our consumers.  With regards to our strategic initiatives, we continue to anticipate they will positively contribute to gross profit rate this year, specifically our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI and DG Fresh. In addition, we also expect continued and meaningful investment in our initiatives this year, including ongoing expenses associated with each. We continue to believe these investments will improve operating margin over time, particularly as the benefits to gross margin continue to scale and ultimately outpace the associated expense with both NCI and DG Fresh expected to be accretive to operating margin in 2020. However, these investments will continue to pressure SG&A rates this year as we accelerate their rollouts.  In closing, I want to reiterate that we are very proud of the team's execution and service during the quarter. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long term.  With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thank you, John. I'd like to start by also thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication as we navigate this difficult time. I want to take the few -- next few minutes to update you on our 4 operating priorities. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did an outstanding job this quarter executing against a portfolio of growth initiatives despite the challenges surrounding COVID-19. Let me highlight some of our recent efforts.  Starting with our cooler door expansion, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During the quarter, we installed more than 15,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install approximately 55,000 cooler doors in 2020, the majority of which will be in our higher capacity coolers as we continue to build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales.  Turning now to private brands, which continues to be a priority as we pursue opportunities to deliver even greater value for our customers, while also driving profitable sales growth. During the quarter, we made great progress with our rebranding and repositioning efforts, including the relaunch of our laundry brand under the Trueliving label. In addition, our Clover Valley redesign has begun rolling out, with over 250 items now available and more to come as we seek to drive greater category awareness and even higher customer adoption.  Moving to our Better For You offering, which is especially important during a time when more food is being consumed at home. This offering is now available in approximately 6,000 stores, with plans to expand to nearly 7,000 stores by year-end.  Finally, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. This service is currently available in approximately 4,800 locations, with plans to expand to over 8,500 stores by year-end, further advancing our strategy of leveraging our unique real estate footprint to increase customer access to services in convenient and nearby locations.  Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, enhancing gross margin remains a critical area of focus for us. In addition to some of our strategic initiatives, which Todd will discuss later, as well as our private brand efforts, foreign sourcing remains an important gross margin opportunity for us. Our efforts this quarter were focused on supporting the business in a rapidly changing global environment. The team did a tremendous job of working closely with each of our supply partners to ensure product availability, including pursuing product substitutions and shifting production to other countries when warranted. Looking ahead, we continue to see significant opportunity to increase our foreign sourcing penetration, while also further diversifying our countries of origin as we seek to provide even greater value and an enhanced assortment offering for our customers.  We also continue to pursue supply chain efficiencies through the further reduction of stem miles and continued expansion of our private fleet. We're especially proud of the team's efforts during the quarter as we delivered against record volumes, while constantly working with our vendor partners to minimize disruptions to supply. We are also executing against additional opportunities to enhance gross margin, including further improvements in shrink and to our category management process.  Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of the business and enhances our ability to bring value and convenience to even more customers across the country. As one of America's essential retailers, we're committed to providing customers with even greater access to essential goods, especially during these unprecedented times. To that end, in the first quarter, we opened 250 new stores, remodeled 481 stores, including 332 in the higher cooler count, DGTP or DGP formats and relocated 17 stores. We also expanded the number of stores offering fresh produce, bringing the total [indiscernible] produce to approximately 750. And despite the added complexities as a result of COVID-19, our best-in-class real estate team has worked diligently with our communities and business partners to keep our real estate plans on track for 2020. As a result, we are maintaining our real estate outlook for the year as we plan to open 1,000 new stores, remodel 1,500 new store -- excuse me, 1,500 stores, and relocate 80 stores, representing nearly 2,600 real estate projects in total. Overall, I am extremely proud of the team's continued ability to execute such high volumes of real estate projects, which is a testament to their dedication to serving new and existing customers.  Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This save-to-serve approach has served us well in navigating the current environment, while keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. Our ongoing efforts to further supply our -- to simplify our operations have been an important factor in eliminating unnecessary tasks. In turn, this has allowed for our store associates to better serve our customers during this period of heightened demand. Beyond enhancing our ability to serve, this process has also generated significant savings across the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. The strength and dedication of our people was on full display during the quarter as we heard countless stories of our frontline employees going above and beyond the call of duty to serve our customers and communities. As Todd noted earlier, we made a significant investment of approximately $60 million in employee bonuses to demonstrate continued appreciation for their exceptional efforts to serve our customers and fulfill the company's mission of serving others. We believe these bonuses, as well as our other investments and benefits, such as additional paid leave, were well received. In fact, we continue to see record low turnover at the store manager level, as well as lower turnover across our associate base. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with our strong applicant flows, as evidenced by the hiring of more than 50,000 people since mid-March. We also continue to embrace innovative approaches to training and development and have recently transitioned to a virtual training environment, resulting in the continued development of our people despite the inability to travel. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with an innovative and growing retailer is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.  In summary, we are executing well from a position of strength, and these operating priorities continue to provide the foundation from which we can drive continued growth in the years ahead. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Jeff. As I've shared with you over the past several quarters, we're investing in and building momentum behind certain strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position and further support long-term sustainable growth. Importantly, as a result of our efforts and investments to date, we believe we are even better positioned to move quickly alongside our customers as we continue to meet their rapidly evolving needs, further accelerated by COVID-19.  Let me take you through some of the most recent highlights, starting with our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in more than 3,200 stores at the end of the quarter, and we plan to expand the offering to a total of approximately 5,000 stores by the end of 2020. We're especially pleased with the strong sales and margin performance our NCI stores delivered in the quarter. We also continue to realize meaningful benefits from incorporating select NCI products and planograms throughout the broader store base, resulting in positive sales and margin contributions to all of our overall first quarter results. These results reinforce our belief that NCI will continue to be a meaningful sales and margin driver as we move forward, and gives us confidence in our rollout plans for 2020. Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. As a reminder, the preliminary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items by removing the markup paid to third-party distributors, thereby enhancing gross margin, and we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories by enabling the accelerated rollout of our high capacity coolers, increasing in-stock levels and eventually expanding our overall assortment offering. Importantly, we are already seeing evidence of success against these goals, including meaningful increase in perishable sales and higher overall in-stock levels in stores being serviced by DG Fresh. In total, we are now self-distributing to more than 9,000 stores from 6 DG Fresh facilities. Our goal for 2020 is to capture benefits from DG Fresh in approximately 12,000 stores from up to 10 facilities, including our first combination facility co-located with our existing dry goods distribution center in Zanesville, Ohio.  We continue to believe this initiative will be accretive to operating margin in 2020, as the benefits begin to exceed associated expenses and growing in the years ahead as we continue to scale this transformational initiative.  Turning to our digital initiative, where our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem that is specifically tailored to providing our core customer with even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. We believe essential brick-and-mortar retailers continue to serve a critical role, and that has never been more evident than in the past few months. We believe our unique store footprint, combined with our digital efforts, have positioned us well in a challenging and changing retail landscape, particularly as we consider the possibilities in a post COVID-19 environment. More specifically, DG Pickup, which is our buy online and pickup-in-the-store offering, provides an important access point for those seeking a more contactless customer experience. We launched a pilot of this solution at the end of Q4 and are very pleased with the initial results, including positive feedback from both customers and employees. Importantly, we are well positioned to scale quickly with plans for rapid expansion as we move ahead. Beyond DG Pickup, DG GO! mobile checkout is currently available in approximately 750 stores, with plans to further expand as we look to combine this feature with self-checkout, providing an even more convenient and contactless checkout solution.  Moving now to Fast Track, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. We are pleased with the store labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a results of our efforts around rolltainer optimization and even more shelf-ready packaging. These improvements are particularly notable in the quarter as our teams work diligently and efficiently to keep products on the shelf. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which represents added flexibility for consumers who may seek to limit face-to-face interaction, while also driving greater efficiencies in the store for our associates. Self-checkout is currently available in more than 30 stores, and our plans consist of a broader rollout later this year as we look to further enhance our convenience proposition.  Overall, we continue to make great progress with our strategic initiatives, while advancing our goal of further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape. As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives as we are constantly evaluating what lies ahead for our customers and our business. We continue to believe we are pursuing the right strategies to capture additional growth opportunities in a rapidly evolving retail landscape.  In closing, we are proud of our strong start to 2020. Our results are a testament to the strong execution and disciplined approach of our team. And with our unique combination of value and convenience, further enhanced through our initiatives, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current environment and come out the other side stronger together with the communities we serve. Importantly, we are very proud of our people, specifically those serving on the front lines, including our store associates, distribution center employees and those in our private fleet. I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our more than 155,000 employees across the company for their tireless commitment and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.  With that, operator, I'd now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : You mentioned that your confidence have moderated a bit in recent days. What has been the magnitude of the moderation? And has it been more so due to other stores reopening and shelter-in-place restrictions being lifted? Or because you're seeing a fading benefit of those stimulus dollars? John Garratt : Thank you, Michael. This is John. And providing a little more context here, we alluded to in the prepared comments that through Q1, through May 26, our same-store sales have increased by 22% during this time frame and had mentioned some intermittent moderation over recent days. Given the unprecedented environment and the spirit of transparency, I do think it's fair to give more color on the recent trends. What we've seen in some recent days is some days in the mid-teens, but we've seen it bounce back in recent days into the mid-20s. So things have been fluid, but sales are still very healthy and we believe we're very well positioned. We're seeing strength in both sides of the box on the consumables side and the nonconsumables. And I think an interesting stat we've seen floating around is just how much people have their stimulus money still deposited in the banks, which leads you to believe there's some tail to that. But we're still seeing strength in both sides of the business and believe with our unique combination of value and convenience, we're very well positioned. Michael Lasser : That's really helpful. My follow-up question is inevitably, and you mentioned that as part of these very healthy comp trends, you've experienced growth from new customers. Are you -- how can you size that contribution? Is it 1/3, 1/4, maybe 1/2 of the overall growth in comp from these new customers? But do you think these new customers will be sticky than what you've enjoyed in the past? Todd Vasos : Yes, Michael, it's Todd. Thank you. Yes, we have seen an increase in customers. And no surprise, right? When the going gets tough, we know that our customers need us more and we're there for them. But we also know from past recessionary times that -- and in times of these, that we have a customer that also starts to trade into Dollar General. We saw that in a very big way in Q1. We can validate that pretty easily through credit card data that we've seen, but also through, as you know, we do extensive quarterly customer interactions and reach-outs. And we know exactly where our customers stand as well as new customers. And I would tell you, those reach-outs to our customers have told us this quarter that not only did we trade in, we loved what we saw, and we plan to repeat shop, if they haven't already. So we're very, very bullish on that. And I think it's a real testament to the work the team has done on this box to make it the most relevant it's been in many, many years. And I would tell you that just like we probably saw in '08, '09, with new customers coming in, they're delighted to see all the changes that we've made. And just like that, I'm very bullish that we'll continue to hold on to those customers for the long term. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. And congrats on a nice quarter, guys. Todd, maybe could you speak to the overall health of your core consumer today, the push and pull between rising unemployment and your ability to deliver value as we think about the 2008, 2009 playbook. I guess maybe larger, what's the economic sweet spot that you think for your model? And if you had to rank initiatives to take additional market share out of this crisis, what would they be? Todd Vasos : Yes, Michael. Thank you. The customer was feeling very good. I think it was a real testament. She was back to work leading into this crisis. So when you look at our strong comp in the month of February, which really had virtually no COVID-related retail in it, she was very, very -- in a very good shape, probably the best we've seen in many, many years. What that was a -- what that enabled her to be able to do was to stock up with confidence, and we saw that early on. She came in and really stocked up first, starting like with paper goods and moving into food. And then obviously, once stimulus started to rollout, we saw, obviously, like other retailers, a surge in our discretionary type categories.  Right now, what I would tell you, because we do talk to her very frequently, as I mentioned earlier, she has a lot more trepidation, obviously, just because of what's going on. But I would tell you that she still has money in her pocket. It's evidenced by what she's doing. But I think a lot of that extra money right now is driven by stimulus, both the basic stimulus that was sent out starting middle of April. But also for perhaps any unemployment that may be needed for our core customer which, by the way, there's evidence to show maybe our core customer is not having to capitalize yet on that because they're most likely frontline workers like many of America's customers today out there. And so she's got a lot of money still in her pocket. But we're watching it very, very closely because that can turn, and we understand that, and we're watching it. But we also are watching when stimulus starts to taper off. And of course, with additional snap benefits that are out there, that's helping as well. So when you put it all together, we feel that we're very well positioned.  The sweet spot, I would tell you, we do very good in good times and we do fabulous in bad times. But I would rather see our core consumer, they have money in her pocket and be able to spend equally on both our consumable and nonconsumable businesses. But we're very, very bullish on what post-COVID looks like because, again, I think we're very well positioned no matter what this economy does to both our core customer and to the customer overall. Matthew Boss : Great answer. Maybe, John, to follow up on the gross margin. What's the best way to think about markdowns, markups and distribution in the second quarter, in the back half as we think about the drivers behind your first quarter gross margin expansion? And any other accelerating tailwinds to consider as Fresh continues to ramp or opportunity on the freight side? John Garratt : Thanks, Matthew. I'll walk you through the puts and takes. I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the Q1 gross margin expansion of 49 basis points. One of the things we didn't call out as a driver was product mix, not a material impact on margin pressure. That really speaks to the surge we saw in nonconsumables, particularly as the stimulus payments came out. That, coupled with the mix within the mix, within consumables, we saw strength in categories like health and beauty, which has margin rates more akin to nonconsumables. So the combination of those helped balance out the mix pressure from the initial surge in consumables and made it really not a material impact for Q1.  What we did see driving benefit in Q1 is what we have been seeing and calling out in recent quarters. One was lower markdowns as a percentage of net sales was the top one. The team remains very targeted on their promotional spending. And then the second one we called out was initial markups on inventory purchases, and that's really DG Fresh. We are seeing the substantial cost benefit we expected to see as we self-distribute frozen refrigerated goods and seeing a growing benefit from NCI as well. So while it's hard to get very specific around Q2 or the following quarters given the dynamics -- the near-term dynamics, what I would say is that we continue to see opportunities to continue increasing our margins over time with the growing benefit of initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI. And the other levers we have, the team continues to do a fabulous job with category management. Private brands, where we've seen elevated sales in recent quarters, and there's a big opportunity in foreign sourcing.  Supply chain, you asked specifically around supply chain. Obviously, there's a little bit of geography there as we take over self-distribution of frozen refrigerated goods. We take on a little bit more cost there, but we save a lot more on the product cost side. But when you strip that out, it's been doing very well driving efficiencies as the team has been working on reducing transportation rates where they've been successful as we've expanded and diversified our carrier base, expanded our private fleet. We're seeing lower fuel costs and they continue to do an excellent job driving efficiencies through stem mile reduction, load optimization and DC productivity efforts.  And then the other one that we didn't really call out this quarter because it wasn't material with shrink, we continue to see an opportunity for shrink over the long term. We're looking forward to the latter part of the year as we see the benefit -- hope to see the benefit of the EAS units, the 6,000 units we installed, completing the chain at the end of last year, looking to see the continued benefit we've seen in the past from those, as well as increased tagging now that we've completed the system.  So I think when you put all those together, we feel very well positioned. Now we always reserve the right to invest in price if needed. But we believe we're in a great position right now with price, and believe we're making the right investments to drive margin expansion over the long-term and believe we have the levers to do so. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : A little bit of a follow-up to the last one. I mean there's a lot of dollars coming in right now to the business, and I want to ask about reinvestment rate. First, on gross margin. I know, John, you just mentioned you feel good about where pricing is. Can you talk about the price elasticity in general? And if you can measure it in this environment? And whether it makes sense to lean in? And then related to that, any COVID costs or ongoing wage issue -- wage costs that you're contemplating, bonuses or wages, as far as maybe soaking up some of the reinvestment dollars? Todd Vasos : Simeon, it's Todd. I'm going to go answer your first one and then kick it over to John for the second piece.  But the first -- your first question, our pricing is as competitive as it's been in the time that I've been here -- in 11 years that I've been here. We are in very, very good shape against all classes of trade. And again, that's one of the cornerstones, as you know, of this model and what our consumers look for, very close second, the convenient pillar. But I would tell you that right now, we don't really need to -- we don't see a need to lean in any further on price because we're so well priced today against all classes' trade. Now we will continue to watch that if something changes.  The other thing to keep in mind is that we've been very, very vigilant around price, especially during this time. What we don't want to do is to raise prices to our consumers in a time of need, especially in a pandemic. So we've been very, very cautious about that, only raising prices on a few items as you look at milk, eggs and a few that have just rapidly increased. Others that may have increased, we've actually held prices down some, so that we are able to service the customer the way she needs to be right now. And to your point, we're doing very well and making sure we're passing some of that on to our consumers as well. John Garratt : And on the investment side, first, we continue to make meaningful investment to advance our strategic initiatives as well as remodels and new stores as we're seeing great returns as expected from those, and that continues as planned and is on track. In addition, as we go forward, health and safety of our employees and customers is our top priority. And so we will continue to invest some there as needed, making sure there's plenty of masks, gloves, hand sanitizer, thorough cleaning protocols and of course, we just recently finished the installation of the plexiglass shield. So we'll do what's necessary and prudent to ensure their safety. Beyond those things, there's nothing material changes that I see right now. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then the follow-up, can you remind us the percentage of stores that are in rural areas versus, I guess, nonrural? And how did -- I guess, the dispersion or range of performance is tracking? I think it was pretty wide at first. And if that's continuing or you're seeing normalization as states begin to reopen? Todd Vasos : Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes. We're at right around 75% rural, very small town-based. So again, we pride ourselves on serving that underserved customer out there. I would tell you that, that footprint really serves us well, especially during this time and our customer as well. Think about being close to home, we're within 5 miles of 75% of America. You think about that small box that we offer, that 7,200 to 7,400 square foot box, she can shop that with convenience and with confidence that there won't be crowds. And then lastly, we want to make sure that as we make sure that new customers come in that we show her the best that we've got, and that's exactly what we've done through this. She's seeing great products, and we've seen great comments from our current customers as well as our new customers. So we feel that we're well positioned. Obviously, we do very well both in our rural locations and our more metro settings. But again, rural being the major driver, I would tell you, has seen a little larger increase in sales overall. But again, I'm very proud of both sides of the equation, our rural and our city-type stores. Operator : The next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Just wanted to ask if I could, for a little bit of additional color on the traffic versus ticket trend in the quarter. Sorry, if I had missed that. And then also on the geographic side, if there's anything you could call out in terms of different regions of the country and how those trends may have gone. Todd Vasos : Yes. Sure. This is Todd. I would tell you, we're very proud that both traffic and ticket were positive in the quarter. And I think that's a real testament, once again, to the power of the box that we have out there and the ability for the consumer to shop both sides of that. So again, very proud of seeing that. Obviously, the ticket side was the larger driver, but I would tell you, a very nice performance on the front side of that, too, on the traffic side.  As far as geographics, throughout the quarter, there were some puts and takes every -- it changed depending on the severity of COVID outbreaks. So think about areas like the Northeast, think about areas like the Midwest, Michigan, Wisconsin, those type of areas. We saw big early surges, obviously in the Northeast. Things leveled out for a bit and then resurged again and it continues to be elevated. So there was some give and take. But I would tell you when all of the dust settled, all of the operating regions were very close together in their performance overall. Michael Montani : And just for the follow-up, if I could, was on multichannel. Just curious about the pickup efforts that you all have in place. If there's any incremental color there, maybe in terms of the pace that you might lean into it, as well as the mobile app. Todd Vasos : Yes. Again, we're just getting going on, on our buy-online, pickup-in-the-store efforts. But I would tell you, I'll give you a couple of nuggets that we have seen early on. One is, she's been very pleased with the transaction and her ability to get what she needs. The repeat was very, very heavy, meaning once she use it once, the repeat was very good on the other side. And again, very high scores, even on our repeat. We know that the customer, as we start to move post pandemic, and we all hope we get there sooner than later, that though retail is going to change a little bit. And I would tell you those that have a strong brick-and-mortar presence as Dollar General has, but also have a very good presence of the digital side to include buy online, pickup in the store, to include areas like self-checkout, where the customer can feel that if she doesn't want to interact or have contact with another person and/or the actual payment terminals, that she can feel very confident to check out in our stores.  I would tell you that I'm so proud of the team and their efforts over the last couple of years because they have set us up for success during this time and will flourish as we go forward. So more to come as we aggressively roll out buy online, pick up in the store in the upcoming months and quarters ahead because we know that the customer is really looking for that option inside of a brick-and-mortar retailer. Operator : Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : And also congrats on a nice quarter. So I guess I wanted to start with store traffic. So it's very notable -- noticeable in your commentary just about the meaningful increase in store traffic, while many of your competitors actually had declining traffic during the quarter. Is there any more color you can provide in terms of what you think is driving that delta between you and some of your peers? Todd Vasos : Yes. When you look at it, again, it was pretty evenly based in the regions as you look out, and backward now, in hindsight. But I would tell you that our rural locations did outperform a little bit in that area. And I think that's a real testament, again, to the rural nature of our box and the ability for customers to stay close to home and shop with confidence in a small box that doesn't have a lot of customers at any given time. I also would tell you that I think once they got in for the first time, she repeated those purchases as she continued to restock her pantries throughout the quarter. So once she got in, I think she really liked what she saw. And I would tell you, I think we did some of the best, if not the best, in keeping in-stock on many of the core items. We got a lot of customer complaints in -- on not being in-stock on some items, but they were paled in comparison to the compliments that we got in saying things like, \"We found stuff that we haven't found in other places in weeks and/or months.\" And that was great to hear. So I think just the combination of that strong box, and our rural location really helped propel those traffic numbers. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question just on the supply chain out of stock. So your inventory was down, I think, more than 5% on a same-store basis. How long do you think -- or when do you think your supply chain will be back to where it needs to be in terms of getting the stores fully stocked? Jeffery Owen : Well, first of all -- this is Jeff. I'm extremely proud of the way the team responded to the in-stock challenges that all retailers faced. And our merchant team was involved very, very early with our suppliers in partnering with ways to get our fair share of product, but also thinking about creative ways to provide alternative pack sizes or substitute items for our stores. And then also, we were able to stand up even new SKUs during this period of time. So merchant team did an outstanding job and then the supply chain, obviously, you can't do that without the supply chain. So they were able to flex up to our demand. And then also, they're able to deliver the product to our stores on time. And then finally, as Todd mentioned as well, Fast Track earlier is -- was one of our initiatives that really paid off during this because the stores were able to get the product on the shelf. As I think out and when it will end, a lot of that depends on the customer. And it also depends on the way the economy in terms of the shelter in place. So as you know, many of the nation is opened up for business now, so we'll have to wait and see. But I can tell you this, our supply chain is ready to deliver the product to the stores when it's available, and our store teams are ready to get it on the shelf. So we'll be in a great position for the customer once the products are available. Operator : Our next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : I wanted to actually go back to a couple of comments you made in terms of the Fresh. You talked about a meaningful increase in Fresh at the stores that you've rolled the Fresh out to. So wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that.  My second question is just on the DG Pickup. I don't know if there's any color you can provide on what the average ticket looks like. And then I had one other follow-up. Todd Vasos : Sure, Karen. Yes, on DG Fresh, I would tell you that we saw a meaningful difference in our in-stock levels, but also, of course, our sales numbers in the stores that we self-distributed. That's exactly what we're going to see for the long-term here. But it was even more amplified, obviously, during COVID-19 and -- when customers were out and still out looking to fill their pantries or refrigerators and freezers with goods instead of going out to eat. And so I believe that it's reacting exactly what we -- how we thought it would. But it was great to see it actually in person and an action as we -- as our customers needed it the most. So I would say that it gives us even greater confidence that as we continue to move over the next upcoming quarters and years ahead, that this is really going to pay a big dividend for us. Karen Short : Okay. And then in terms of the average ticket with Pickup, is there any meaningful delta or anything to point to that? I know it's still early stage. Todd Vasos : Yes. It is still early stage, but I would tell you that the average basket is not dissimilar to what we would normally see inside of a store, which we thought, right? So 5 to 6 items could be 7 or 8, but let's call it, 5 to 8 in total, but closer to that 6 range, with the basket size being a little larger from a dollar amount, but not meaningful. And again, it's doing exactly what we thought it would do. I don't believe our core customer is going to change her shopping behavior over the long term. I still fully believe that when she comes in, she comes in often and buys 5 to 8 items with a ring of about $12 to $13 basket sizes. And we believe that buy online, pickup in the store will be no different. Karen Short : Okay. And then SNAP recently increased pretty meaningfully, and I think it was about a 40% increase in monthly SNAP benefits. I guess the question is, how sustainable -- well, first of all, did you see that impact in terms of May on sales? And how sustainable do you think that will be in terms of the benefit to the comp? Because obviously, this is similar to an '08, '09 increase in terms of percentage. John Garratt : Karen, this is John. We have seen a benefit from that. As you know, recent legislation has let states make it easier for families to continue participating, has provided emergency supplemental benefits. I think it's up to 2 months as it stands now. And then also, in lieu of the National School Lunch Program, is providing $20.58 -- $20.50 per week per dependent. So the combination of those is helping our customer, and we are seeing enhanced purchasing power and increased EBT sales. So how long that persists, it depends on how long these benefits persist. But what I would tell you is, we have been growing our share with these customers over time as we serve them well, growing EBT share. And we're focused on controlling what we can control, and that's taking care of them, and we'll see how it plays out in terms of the duration of the legislation. But we are seeing the benefit. Operator : Our last question comes from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra : Great quarter. Just wondering as we go forward, do you see potential to be more aggressive in certain initiatives like private label and DG Fresh in this challenged environment? Is there opportunity to do more produce in those stores? You mentioned meaningful investments in your initiatives. Just want to clarify, is this an acceleration in your investments versus when you last spoke about them during 4Q? And is there an opportunity to double down on some of these initiatives in this challenged backdrop? Todd Vasos : Thank you. That's a great question. The numbers that John alluded to, they weren't a very big acceleration, but I would tell you, the one area that we're -- we have accelerated our thinking, as well as our expenditure has been around buy online, pick up in the store. We thought it would be a more gradual rollout. But again, seeing what we have seen now through COVID-19 and what our customers are telling us about wanting an option, if she wants to take advantage of it in that contactless world, I would tell you that buy online, pickup in the store has accelerated and our spending against it as well as the rollout into our stores will be vastly different than what we had thought. And our hope would be we would roll out the majority of the chain by the end of this year as we roll forward.  As you look at the other area that we would anticipate, maybe expanding a little bit faster will be our self-checkout. It would be our goal eventually to help self-checkout in virtually all of our stores. It was going to be a few year rollout. We believe we can accelerate that some as we continue to move forward in 2020, but also accelerate it in '21, for sure, as again, the consumer is looking for more of a contactless experience in some cases.  So those are just a couple, but we're taking a look at DG Fresh as well. We have a very aggressive plan there, as you already know. But the produce side is a great question, and we continue to evaluate our stores to put produce in. And that very well could be an expansion as we move through later this year and into '21 as well.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I'd like to start by thanking our associates for their exceptional work over the past several months as we continue to navigate this challenging and dynamic operating environment. Throughout this period, our team has remained steadfast in its focus on employee and customer safety, while providing affordable, convenient and close to home access to everyday essentials. I could not be more proud of our team's efforts to serve our customers, our communities and each other. For over 80 years, Dollar General has served our customers through a unique combination of value and convenience. But it has never been more evident just how essential our role is as our customers depend on us now more than ever for their everyday household needs. We remain committed to being part of the solution during these difficult times and believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our expansive network of nearly [ 17,000 ] within 5 miles or more than 75% of the U.S. population, our convenient small box format, providing for a quick in and out access, our broad assortment of everyday household essentials -- essential items, our ongoing commitment to everyday low price, our flexible supply chain, our growing digital capabilities and most importantly, our talented and committed associates. Let me now highlight some of the actions we've taken to further protect our employees and customers while keeping our operations running with minimal disruption. As we discussed on last quarter's call, with the onset of COVID-19, we quickly and proactively implemented numerous safety protocols across the company based on recommendations by federal state and local government agencies. We continue to monitor CDC and other government guidelines regarding COVID-19 and are adapting our protocols and policies as that guideline evolves. As announced in today's release, we invested approximately $13 million in employee appreciation bonuses during the quarter, bringing our total incremental investment and appreciation bonuses to about $73 million through the end of Q2. Additionally, we expect to invest up to $50 million in additional financial incentives in the second half of the year. Overall, these actions have helped to further ensure the continuity of our business at a time when our customers need us most, while recognizing our employees for their extraordinary efforts. While navigating the challenging times of COVID-19, our country has simultaneously entered a period of deep reflection on its societal values, including racial equality and other matters of social justice. Our mission at Dollar General is serving others and our core values include respecting the dignity and differences of others. We are committed to ensuring these values are evident in all we do, including working to promote racial equality and social justice across our communities. To further advance these efforts, we recently expanded our diversity and inclusion team and announced the combined $5 million pledge with the Dollar General Literacy Foundation to support racial and social justice and education. Additionally, during the quarter, we published our most recent Serving Others report, which highlights many of our efforts on the ESG front. We first published this report in 2019 and expect that it will evolve and expand as we move into the future. Beyond these efforts, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and better position Dollar General for continued long-term growth. To that end, and from a position of strength, we are pleased to announce the acceleration of several value-creating initiatives, including DG Pickup, DG Fresh and our nonconsumable initiatives. We are also increasing our expectation for remodels and relocations in 2020. We will discuss each of these updates in more detail later in the call. Turning now to our second quarter performance. The quarter was once again highlighted by extraordinary growth on both the top and bottom lines as some of the consumer trends we experienced in Q1 related to the pandemic continued in Q2. More specifically, and as we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we experienced significant growth in our nonconsumable business in the month of April and through May 26. These trends continued through the end of Q2, and we're pleased to note that for the second quarter, our 3 nonconsumable product categories in total delivered a combined comp sales percentage increase well in excess of our consumable businesses.  In terms of our monthly comp cadence, sales increased 21.5% in May, 17.9% in June and 17.2% in July. While we do not typically disclose monthly comp sales, we believe it's helpful in this environment. Overall, second quarter net sales increased 24.4% to $8.7 billion, driven by comp sales growth of 18.8%. These results include significant growth in average basket size, particularly -- partially, excuse me, offset by a decline in customer traffic, as we believe customers consolidated trips in an effort to limit social contact. During the quarter, our highly consumable market share trends, as measured by syndicated data, continued to exhibit strength, including strong double-digit increases in both units and dollars over the 4, 12, 24 and 52-week periods ending July 25, 2020. Importantly, our data suggests another meaningful increase in new customers this quarter compared to Q2 2019, underscoring the broadening appeal of our value and convenience proposition. We are very focused on retaining these new customers and the incremental spend of current customers through the acceleration of several key initiatives, which I noted earlier. We're particularly pleased that we once again delivered significant operating margin expansion, which contributed to second quarter diluted EPS of $3.12, an increase of 89% over the prior year. Collectively, we view these results as further validation that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable balance and sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value. We continue to operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And with the plans and initiatives we have in place, we believe we are well positioned to serve an even broader set of consumers, even in a challenging economic environment. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year and all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share. In addition, please note that Q2 2019 adjusted results exclude a $31 million pretax impact related to significant legal expenses recorded in the quarter, as discussed in today's earnings release. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.5% in the second quarter, an increase of 167 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from nonconsumable categories and a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs, which were driven by increased volume and our decision to incur employee appreciation bonus expense. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 20.4%, a decrease of 205 basis points or 161 basis points compared to Q2 2019 adjusted SG&A. Although we incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19, these costs were more than offset by the significant increase in sales. Expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales in the quarter include retail labor, occupancy costs, utilities, employee benefits, depreciation and amortization and taxes and licenses. These items were partially offset by increased incentive compensation and charitable giving expenses. As I mentioned, we also recorded expenses of $31 million in Q2 2019, reflecting  estimate the settlement of certain legal matters. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter was $1 billion, an increase of 80.5% or 71.3% compared to Q2 2019 adjusted operating profit. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 12%, an increase of 373 basis points or 329 basis points compared to Q2 2019 adjusted operating profit. Operating profit in the second quarter was positively impacted by COVID-19, primarily through higher sales. The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately $38 million of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers and approximately $13 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5% and compares to 22.9% in the second quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted earlier, EPS for the second quarter was $3.12, which represents an increase of 89% or 79% compared to Q2 2019 adjusted EPS. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers' employees during these challenging times while continuing to invest for the long term. Merchandise inventories were $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, essentially flat overall and down 6% on a per-store basis. Year-to-date through Q2, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $2.9 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion or 157%. This increase was primarily driven by strong operating performance combined with lower levels of inventory as our supply chain teams continue to work closely with our vendor partners to improve in-stock levels for high demand products. Total capital expenditures through the first half were $424 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations and spending related to our strategic initiatives. Moving on to liquidity and capital structure. We continue to have ample liquidity as a result of the measures we took earlier in the year to further bolster our liquidity position, coupled with our extremely strong cash flow in the quarter. As a result, we finished the quarter with $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion of availability under our undrawn revolving credit facility. As one of the measures to preserve liquidity at the onset of COVID-19, we temporarily suspended share repurchases during Q1. We continue to evaluate business conditions and our liquidity, and as a result of this evaluation, we resumed share repurchases in the second quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of our common stock for $602 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $90 million. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization, we have remaining authorization of approximately $2.5 billion under the repurchase program. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2020. We continue to operate in a time of significant uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. As a result, we are not providing guidance for fiscal 2020 sales or EPS at this time. With regards to share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our strong liquidity position and confidence about the long-term growth opportunity for our business. As Todd noted earlier, we are increasing our expectations for remodels and relocations in 2020. Overall, we now expect to open 1,000 new stores, remodel 1,670 stores and relocate 110 stores, representing 2,780 real estate projects in total. Finally, we are increasing our expectations for capital spending in 2020 to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion as we accelerate key initiatives and continue to invest in our core business to support and drive future growth. Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our full year outlook. Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in August. Since the end of Q2 and through August 25, we have continued to experience elevated same-store sales, which have increased by approximately 15% during this time frame. That said, we remain cautious in our sales outlook and recognize the significant uncertainty that still exists concerning the duration of the positive operating environment. In particular, we can't speculate as to whether there will be additional government stimulus, or if so, to what degree our business would benefit. Ultimately, we expect to see our comp sales trends moderate as we move through the back half, but believe we are very well positioned to deliver positive sales growth for the balance of the year, even if broader economic conditions deteriorate. With regards to our strategic initiatives, we continue to anticipate they will improve operating margin over time, particularly as benefits to gross margin continue to scale and outpace the associated expense with both NCI and DG Fresh expected to be accretive to operating margin in 2020. However, our investment in these initiatives will pressure SG&A rates in the back half, particularly as we further accelerate their rollouts. Finally, we expect to make additional investments in the second half as a result of COVID-19, including up to $50 million in employee appreciation bonuses, which Todd mentioned, as well as investments in additional safety measures. In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and service, which resulted in another quarter of exceptional results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our 4 operating priorities. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did an outstanding job this quarter, executing against a portfolio of growth initiatives, while keeping the customer at the center of all we do. Let me highlight a few of our recent efforts, starting with our cooler door expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative.  During the first half, we added more than 30,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we now expect to install more than 60,000 cooler doors this year compared to our previous target of 55,000 cooler doors in 2020. Notably, the majority of these doors will be in high capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection.  Turning now to private brands, which remains a priority as we pursue opportunities to further enhance our value proposition. During the quarter, we made great progress with our rebranding and repositioning efforts, including the recent relaunch of our office products brand. Looking ahead, our plans include the continued expansion of existing brands as well as the rebranding of several additional product lines as we seek to drive greater category awareness and even higher customer adoption.  Moving to our Better For You offering, which is especially important for our customers as more food continues to be consumed at home. This offering is now available in approximately 6,400 stores, with plans to expand more than 7,000 stores by year-end.  Finally, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. This convenient package pickup and drop-off service is now available in over 8,000 locations. We now expect to complete our initial rollout to more than 8,500 stores by the end of Q3, further advancing our long track record of serving rural communities.  Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, enhancing gross margin remains a key focus area for us. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with our NCI, DG Fresh and private brand efforts, foreign sourcing remains an important gross margin opportunity for us. During the quarter, the team once again did a phenomenal job working with our global supply partners to ensure product availability. Looking ahead, we continue to see opportunities to increase our foreign sourcing penetration while further diversifying our countries of origin.  We also continue to pursue supply chain efficiencies through the further reduction of stem miles and accelerated expansion of our private fleet. To this end, we recently announced the purchase of our 18th traditional distribution center in Walton, Kentucky. We anticipate this facility will begin shipping early next year, enabling us to drive additional efficiencies as we move ahead.  Finally, shrink remains an opportunity as we continue to build on our success with the electronic article surveillance. Over the past year, we've increased the number of items tagged by more than 40%, and we continue to focus on leveraging technology to drive even higher levels of in-store execution.  Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. During the first half, we opened 500 new stores; remodeled 973 stores, including 704 in the higher cooler count DGTP or DGP formats; and relocated 43 stores. We also added produce in more than 120 stores, bringing the total number of stores which carry produce to more than 870. As John noted, we now expect 2,780 real estate projects in total this year as we continue to deploy capital in these high-return investments while delivering an expanded assortment offering to an additional 200 communities in 2020. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and I am very proud of the team's ability to execute such high volumes of real estate product -- projects despite the added complexities as a result of COVID-19.  Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as save to serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our operational initiatives consist of building on our success with Fast Track, which Todd will discuss in more detail. As a result of our efforts to date, our store associates are able to better serve our customers during this period of heightened demand, as evidenced by recent customer survey results, which we are seeing overall satisfaction at all-time highs. Beyond enhancing our ability to serve, this process has also generated significant savings across the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. In total, for fiscal 2020, we now expect to invest up to $123 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees to provide them with further support and demonstrate our continued appreciation for their exceptional efforts during these difficult times. As a reminder, these bonuses follow our 2017 investment of nearly $70 million in store manager compensation and training as well as prior and continued investments in employee training, benefits and wages. Importantly, these investments continue to yield positive results across our store base, including continued record low store manager turnover, strong applicant flows and a robust internal promotion pipeline as well as record staffing levels over the first half of the year. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. We also held our annual leadership meeting earlier this month, and I was amazed by the team's ability to seamlessly transition to a virtual event, resulting in continued development for more than 1,500 leaders of our company. This meeting was once again a testament to how our people truly embrace the Serving Others culture.  In summary, we are executing well from a position of strength, and our operating priorities continue to provide a strong foundation from which we can continue to provide continued growth in years ahead.  And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Jeff. I'm very proud of the progress the team has made in advancing our key strategic initiatives, which we believe better positions us for long-term sustainable growth. Let me take you through some of the most recent highlights.  Starting with our nonconsumable initiative or NCI, as a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in approximately 4,300 stores at the end of Q2 and we continue to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across our NCI product categories. In fact, this performance is contributing to an incremental 8% comp sales increase in total nonconsumable sales compared to stores without the NCI offering as well as a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate in these stores.  We also continue to realize meaningful benefits from incorporating select NCI products and planograms throughout the broader store base, resulting in positive sales and margin contributions across the chain. As a result of our strong performance and learnings to date, our plans now include accelerating the rollout of our NCI offering to more than 5,400 stores by the end of 2020, by incorporating a light version of this initiative into approximately 400 stores. The light version provides for a more streamlined approach as the full NCI assortment is incorporated into space already dedicated to nonconsumable products, resulting in less disruption to the stores and the ability to more aggressively scale this initiative as we move ahead. We believe NCI will continue to be a meaningful sales and margin driver as we move forward. And I'm very excited about the additional opportunities to further leverage our success and learnings with this important initiative.  Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. As a reminder, the primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items by removing the markup paid to third party distributors, thereby enhancing gross margin. And we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. In fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are seeing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases, which John noted earlier, and we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative. Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories. We are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of more than 55 additional new items, including both national and private brands in select stores being serviced by DG Fresh. In total, we were self-distributing to more than 12,000 stores from 8 -- excuse me, from 8 DG Fresh facilities at the end of Q2. Given our success and strong execution to date, we now expect to capture benefits from DG Fresh in approximately 14,000 stores from at least 10 facilities by the end of this year. This compares to our previous expectation of approximately 12,000 stores by year's end. Turning to our digital initiative, where our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, all of which have become even more important as a result of COVID-19. Today, customers are seeking safe, familiar and convenient experiences in many aspects of their lives. And in that regard, we believe our unique store footprint, combined with our digital assets, are a distinct competitive advantage.  During the quarter, we accelerated the rollout of DG Pickup, our buy online, pick up in the store offering to more than 2,500 stores compared to about 40 stores at the end of Q1, with plans for even more aggressive expansion as we move ahead. In fact, we now expect to introduce this offering into essentially all of our stores by the end of Q3. In addition to DG Pickup, our plans include the further expansion of DG GO! mobile checkout as we look to combine this feature with self-checkout, providing an even more convenient and contactless shopping experience.  Moving now to Fast Track, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on shelf availability. We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity investments we are seeing as a result of our efforts around rolltainer optimization and even more shelf-ready packaging.  The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which represents added flexibility for customers who may seek to limit face-to-face interactions while also driving greater efficiencies in the store for our associates. Self-checkout is currently available in approximately 400 stores compared to more than 30 stores at the end of Q1. And our plans consist of a broader rollout later this year as we look to further enhance our convenience proposition.  Overall, we are focused on controlling what we can control, while taking action, including the acceleration of our strategic initiatives, to further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.  As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives as we are constantly evaluating what lies ahead for our customers and our business. We continue to believe we are pursuing the right strategies to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating value for our shareholders.  In closing, we are excited about our position midway through the year. Our extraordinary first half results are a testament to the strong execution and disciplined approach of our team. We are very proud of our people, especially those serving on the front lines, and I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our approximately 157,000 employees across the company for their tireless dedication of fulfilling our mission of serving others.  With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : My first question is, any way you can parse through thinking about the trade-down effect and -- which is bringing more customers to your store, what you mentioned, versus the timing of stimulus? And so I don't know how you sort through both of those factors. Todd Vasos : Sure. Yes. We obviously talk to our customers each and every quarter. So we've got real good data from that. But also through our credit card data, we can see that we're getting a trade down at a pretty good clip. And we saw that in Q1, and that continued into Q2. And of course, as we just talked about the first period up to just here in Q3.  So as we continue to watch this evolve, what we see is very reminiscent to what we saw during the Great Recession, even though it was more of a financial recession versus where we are today. This one is starting to turn more into and look a little bit like that recession. And during that time, obviously, we saw a pretty good trade down. And we've got a nice track record and the playbook to hopefully be able to retain those customers as we continue to move through COVID and hopefully, post COVID.  But we're really focused on servicing those customers right now that are coming in. And I would tell you that the information we're getting back through our customer work, our proprietary custom work, really speaks to the additional stuff that we've done inside of our store over the last 18 months to 2 years, DG Fresh being the big one, our cooler expansions, and obviously, our NCI, in our nonconsumable initiatives over the last 18 months to 2 years have been very, very fruitful for this customer. So we're very optimistic that we'll continue to see that trade down, and we're as optimistic that we'll be able to keep a great deal of them as we continue to move forward. Simeon Gutman : And related to it, can you talk about how you saw the discretionary mix of product evolve during the quarter? And then if you can, into the third quarter? John Garratt : Sure. As we mentioned in the previous call, it started with consumables stock up at the beginning of the pandemic. Then in April, as we saw the stimulus money in play and people sheltered in place, we saw a pretty significant shift into discretionary categories like home doing phenomenally, toys seasonal. And that continued all the way through Q2, and it's continued to remain very strong.  I think it's important to note our discretionary business was doing very well coming into this. We've had 9 straight quarters of nonconsumable growth, and I think it really is a testament to what we've done with NCI. Stimulus certainly helped as well as the changing in shopping patterns where people were sheltered in place. But I think what we've done to make this part of the store more relevant than ever with the rotation of goods, the greater variety and aspirational products has really made it relevant and really helped us capture this additional business. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : And congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe first on the margin side, how best to think about the drivers of gross margin as we think about the third quarter or the back half of the year? As we think about IMU, nonconsumables and markdowns, which drove outsized expansion in the second quarter? John Garratt : Thanks, Matt. Good question. I'll maybe start by talking about the drivers of Q2, and that may help inform the balance of the year. We're not giving specific guidance on Q3, but I think it gives you an idea. And I'll start by saying how pleased we are with the performance, 167 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q2 was phenomenal, and that marks our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion.  The initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI, in particular, are really contributing. If you look at the drivers, the top 3 drivers in Q2, #1 was higher initial markups, and that was driven primarily by DG Fresh. And that's a benefit. We expect to continue to grow as we scale. The second one was mix. We saw the benefit, of course, of stimulus and the changes to shopping behavior I mentioned, but I also believe that, as I said, NCI is playing a meaningful contributor to getting more of that nonconsumable business. And with that higher nonconsumable mix, that was a big driver of the favorable mix as well as we saw a good mix within the mix with categories like health and beauty doing very well within our consumables. And then the third one was higher initial markups -- I'm sorry, rather, the third one was lower promotional activity. We've been talking about it for a few quarters now. We've been more and more targeted with the tools we've put in place to get more bang for the buck with our promotional activity in this environment. It wasn't as necessary. So that was the 3 key drivers. As you look ahead, obviously, we got some extra benefit from a pretty -- a very significant shift into nonconsumables, so I wouldn't expect that kind of shift every quarter. That gave us some extra juice. But as you look at the initiatives we have in place, we expect to see a growing benefit from DG Fresh and NCI. And we have a lot of other opportunities to leverage. The team did a great job on category management. We have more opportunity with private brands in foreign sourcing penetration, supply chain efficiencies. There is some near-term pressure from distribution and transportation costs : one, keeping up with the volume; two, the additional bonuses that we've put in place; and then three, there is some carrier rate pressure, but the team is doing a phenomenal job mitigating that with the actions they have in place.  So -- and then the last thing is we'll always watch price but we feel very good about where we're priced now. So not commenting specifically on Q3, but just in general, we feel very good about what we've done to drive this continued growth and gross margin expansion. And over the long term, I think we're very well positioned in making the right investments to drive gross margin expansion over the long term and have a lot of levers. Matthew Boss : That's great. And then a follow-up on unit growth from here. So with the consolidation of brick-and-mortar retailers laterally, and then tying this to the acceleration of real estate projects that you guys cited for this year. Maybe, Todd, what are you seeing from new store productivity or metrics out of your new stores? And how best to think about the expansion opportunity or long-term saturation, just given the market share in the white space opportunity that this current crisis seems to be opening up. Todd Vasos : Yes, Matt, that's a great question. And I would tell you that we're very pleased with the continued improvements that we continue to make each and every quarter in our store, in the box, making it more relevant to a broad-based amount of consumers in many different type of settings, all the way from our rule, which is our bread and butter, all the way into vertical living with our DGX box. And I would tell you that we still believe we got 12,000-or-so opportunities to place a Dollar General out there across the Continental United States. And obviously, with some of the recent COVID activity and some of the displacement that we've seen, that opportunity continues to expand as far as I'm concerned, and we continue to watch that very carefully. And we have actually done a lot of work into -- we're not ready yet to talk about '21, but we've done a lot of work into our '21 pipeline as well. So we feel good about where we are. We feel good about that ability to continue to build stores and attract and retain those customers. Operator : Our next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Just a couple of things to elaborate on. So first of all, within the NCI, that 8%, I just want to clarify. So those stores that were currently comping 27%, is that how I'm interpreting that statement? And then I guess what I was wondering is, could you talk a little bit about how that's trended over time? And then also how those stores are looking into August? And then I had another separate question. Todd Vasos : Yes. So Karen, I think that your back of the envelope is pretty close because we're seeing an outsized benefit in our NCI stores. And the great thing is not only that top line, but of course, that margin line. And the lines will get more and more blurred as we go. And the reason being is that we're moving a lot of the great learnings from NCI into the bulk of the chain as well, which is great because then we're getting benefit in the rest of the chain at the same time that we're growing the NCI piece. And we're taking the best of the best there. So we really like what we see and we continue to be very bullish, and that's the reason why we're expanding that extra 400 stores and doing it in that light version and that light version will give all the items that you see in NCI without all the movement inside the store for that disruption. And we believe that, that may be the unlock as we move into next year to do more of these remodels. Karen Short : Okay. And then in terms of the buy online, pick up in store, I mean, that seems like, obviously, a pretty -- being at all stores by year-end is a massive acceleration from, what, the 40 that you're at, at 1Q. So I'm actually wondering if you could talk to what the impact is on the comps for the stores that currently have buy online. And then maybe any color you could give in terms of what the basket looks like at those stores, with the specifically the buy online, pick up in store. Todd Vasos : Sure, sure. Well, first of all, we have to say we're at the very start of this journey, right? So football field, we're on our own 10-yard line so we've got a ways to go here. But again, because of the acceleration, you can imagine, we like what we've seen in the early data. But again, it's so early to draw any large or broad-based conclusions. But I would tell you that what we've seen early on in a couple of anecdotes is that the consumer is enjoying the experience, rating the app very high.  What we're seeing, we saw a little bit in the test stores, and we're seeing it even in the expanded stores now that we're up to over a couple of thousand and soon to roll out to the chain, is that we're seeing -- when the customer comes in to pick up her order, she's actually buying additional items inside the store, which then is increasing that basket size to above where we normally would see our basket size. So we like what we see early on, but we're just -- what we like to say, we're running water through the pipes right now to make sure everything is working, make sure the customer experience is right. And then we'll really start to market it heavy as we move to the backside of this quarter and into Q4, but also into next year to really start to drive some awareness into it.  We -- lastly, we believe this will be a very big benefit for that trade-down customer I talked about earlier. Because that trade-down customer that we've seen is a little -- skewed a little younger, more digitally savvy with families. And we believe that this will be right up her alley as well as she continues to learn about Dollar General and grow with Dollar General. Operator : Our next question is from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Peter Keith : Great quarter. I was wondering just if you could comment on the geography of the store base with the urban versus rural exposure, if you saw any meaningful differences between the 2? Todd Vasos : Yes. This is Todd again. Actually, what we experienced, which was great to see, is pretty even performance across our rural store base and more of our city setting store base. So once again, we've done a lot of work around our city and/or more urban settings, with much work being done around those type of stores, including our DGX stores. But in saying that, we were very pleased with the overall sales and margin performance was very, very similar in both sides of that. So it was great to see. Peter Keith : Okay. Helpful. And then it might be the wrong time to ask, but I do want to kind of circle back on your long-term guidance, and it's been a couple of years since you put out that 10% to 15% EPS growth range that you wanted to achieve annually. How are you thinking about that today? Because it seems like you have a number of initiatives that are all working in conjunction. And perhaps, if anything, that range at this point, looks a bit conservative. John Garratt : Great question. I'm not going to comment specifically on 2021 or give you any specific predictions. But what I will tell you is we are extremely excited about the fundamentals of the business. We are extremely well positioned. We continue to see ourselves as 10%-plus EPS growers over the long term as you look at the unit growth opportunity we have and the long runway there and the type of performance we're seeing from these new units. It's the best performance we've seen in years. When you look at our sales with all the levers that we have, all the initiatives, really clicking to drive the top line and meaningfully the bottom line when you look at our strategic initiatives and the momentum on the comps. And when you look at gross margin, all the levers that we have and the initiatives going after that. Obviously, with the cash we generate, substantial cash flow we've been producing, that allows us to reinvest in what we announced was accelerating these initiatives. So we really believe we're extremely well positioned with the initiatives. We really believe what we've been doing to the box has made it more relevant than ever and believe that we're now providing a fuller fill in trip for customers coming in. So as we look to make these larger baskets stick to the extent possible, as we look to keep these new customers that we've attracted coming back, we think we're very well positioned with the initiatives we've put in place and more relevant than ever and very excited about the future. Operator : Our next question is from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Kelly Bania : Was hoping you could maybe just help quantify. You called out a little bit of SG&A pressures as you accelerate some of your initiatives in the back half. I think that was separate from the $50 million in COVID-related costs. So maybe you can just give us a little color, if you can, in just in terms of dollars that you're thinking in the second half there? John Garratt : We didn't divulge the exact dollar amount. What we did do is we gave new guidance around capital, and so you can kind of extrapolate. That's where a lot of that capital was going toward was these new -- accelerating the initiatives as well as accelerating real estate. On the expense side, I would look at it more as an acceleration of money we were already going to spend as opposed to additional investments. And so you could kind of think about the proportionality of what we're doing in terms of advancing these. So Todd mentioned the 400 additional NCI stores we're doing, we're going to be serving more fresh stores as we going to be serving 14,000 at the end of the year instead of 12,000 stores. We're going to be scaling DG Pickup across the chain in Q3 and adding 200 more projects. So I would really look at it more in terms of just proportionately pulling those expenses forward, not additional expenses. And again, all these things we do are aimed at high-return projects where we're really focused on pulling that benefit forward. So there is some front-end pressure of cost with the start-up and the initial costs associated with that, but the benefits far outpace that, and that's really what we're focused on, is pulling more of that benefit forward. Kelly Bania : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just another quick one on margins. Obviously, DG Fresh going really well. And in order of magnitude, it sounds like the gross margin benefit from that is larger than mix, which is quite incredible. So just was curious if you could just talk about, as you look at your supply chain today, how much more opportunity is there to bring more in-house versus what you have at third parties? You gave some metrics on stores, but maybe just talk about it a little bit bigger picture. Todd Vasos : As we continue to always look to be a low-cost operator, we're always looking at opportunities. While we're still working DG Fresh, our goal is still by the end of next year to be essentially fully self-distributed on our perishable side of the business. But there are some other areas in nonconsumables that we'll be looking at. But also DG Fresh unlocks even greater opportunity down the road of ensuring that our dry network is efficient as possible.  And that may look like some goods coming out of our traditional DCs and moving into Fresh, leaving more room for other goods in our main DCs. So think of things like candy and water. Some of the things that we can move into our Fresh facilities that makes a lot of sense. And those areas will loosen up a lot of other areas inside of our DCs to make room for other type of goods. So we're looking at all that right now. But as you can imagine, we're squarely focused on ensuring we roll out Fresh at the highest level of execution we can.  And I can't be more prouder of the team, especially through a very, very dynamic first half, I think, would be the best way to put it, especially with COVID and everything going on. They have executed at a very high level to include our stores and our operators to ensure that we're servicing the customer at a very high level. So couldn't be more happy with DG Fresh, but there's always more room for opportunity as we continue to move forward in distribution. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Todd, when you make the analogy from the current environment to '08, '09, do you see any major differences? And the reason why I asked the question is in '08, '09, you saw a big spike of sales initially after the recession set in. And then you saw a really healthy comp growth for years even after that. So to use that parallel, wouldn't you expect similar growth in the years ahead even after you've anniversary-ed some of the really big comp growth that you've seen recently? Todd Vasos : It's a great question, Michael. And I want to frame it up to make sure we all remember, and I was the merchant at that time back in '08, '09, '10. And then there, we did a lot of other work to the box, right, to start to really make it very relevant to the consumer. So at the same time we were seeing a trade in, we were also growing the amount of SKUs. We doubled the amount of SKUs from 2009 to 2011 as an example, right, going from 5,700 to 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs, pretty much where we sit today. But I think it's important to also note, we continue to refine that box, and that box is even more relevant today. Now we don't expect to see probably the same amount of outside sales comps for that long of a time, just because of the initiatives that we had then versus now. But the important thing here is we've got some great initiatives that will, in my opinion, make her much more stickier today than she would have been even in '08, '09 because of DG Fresh, because of our digital initiatives, because of NCI and really showing her a real treasure hunt opportunity on the nonconsumable side of the business.  So very bullish on being able to keep that consumer, probably at a higher rate. We'll just have to see if we get as many of those consumers over the long haul. I'd say we're probably, what, who knows how far we're into COVID. So we'll have to wait until we get to the backside of COVID before we know exactly how many customers we have received or gotten into the brand. And then we're going to do everything possible to continue to keep as many as we can. Michael Lasser : Hopefully, we get to the other side soon. Todd Vasos : I'm with you. Michael Lasser : Yes, right? My follow-up question is on -- speaking of these new customers, as you look at your credit card data, are you seeing more of the growth in the nonconsumable, in the discretionary area coming from those new customers? Because the core DG customer historically has really lived in a tight budget. It doesn't have the excess funds necessarily to buy those nondiscretionary goods -- or those discretionary goods, I should say. And is that the way we should read it? So more of the growth coming in the discretionary categories from those new customers? Todd Vasos : Yes. I would tell you that we were very pleased with our core customers' ability to buy nonconsumables. I would tell you that's more the driver. And now some of that was stimulus related. But again, I believe a lot of it had to do with our ability to attract new customers as well, but also showing her something different because of our nonconsumable initiatives that we've got moving.  Now as we all know, some of the stimulus has started to wane but as you can tell by our numbers that we've posted through Q2 and into the -- just about the full force period of Q3, that we continue to see a pretty robust customer on both sides of the equation. So she's liking what she sees. She has a little bit of money in her pocket. I think we're seeing a good trade down, which is helping. But our core customer is spending there as well. And I think it really goes to, again, the amount of work we've done. But plus, she's at home a little bit more. She has a little bit more probably disposable income because she's not doing other things. And with that, she really likes what she sees and buying a lot of our products. Operator : Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So obviously, overall sales trends were strong through the quarter, remains strong right now, but really being driven by ticket rather than transactions. So how should we think about the concept of gaining market share and the new customers that you've referenced versus lower overall transaction levels? Todd Vasos : Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes, our traffic was down, and I'll give you a little anecdote. It was low single digits, so not dramatically down, but down. And we like to see that up, and we strive for that, obviously, all the time. Now in saying that the -- between our core customer having money to be able to do a fuller shop and the trade down that we've got will offset any of that. So we like what we see from the customer base we have. And she is just consolidating her trips, not as much at Dollar General as we may see in other places, but yet, she's consolidating. And so we continue to offer her more and more so that when she's in, she can do a fuller shop and she doesn't feel compelled to have to go elsewhere. So I think that's really what you're seeing from our brand. And we'll continue to show her products that she wants and needs, but also products that may be a surprise and delight. Scot Ciccarelli : Todd, should we think about the surge that you've seen in discretionary sales as really a function of that fuller shop then? Again, I think a lot of us are trying to get our arms around you always had consumables not outpace discretionary and first time in 10-plus years, you saw that kind of reverse this quarter. So I guess I'm just trying to figure out what drove that and maybe it's the fuller shop, maybe it's something else. Todd Vasos : No. When you look at it, and I don't want anybody to take the opinion that our consumable business wasn't very healthy, it was very healthy. It was just outpaced by our nonconsumable or discretionary side of the equation.  I would tell you, I believe fully that it's a couple of things. One, we are seeing that trade down, and she likes what she sees. And we're seeing repeat in the trade down. We can see it in the credit card data. So not only is she shopping at Schwan's, she has shopped us multiple times during this COVID outbreak and pandemic that we've seen. So it tells us that she likes what she sees, and she's coming back. So she's helping drive and propel that nonconsumable business. But also our core consumer likes what she sees. And she was buying some of that product possibly elsewhere. And I think she now sees the benefit of shopping Dollar General there from all the work that we've done.  So I'm very bullish on what that looks like as we get to the backside of the pandemic because of all the work we've done. But we are continuing to ensure that working both sides of the equation, meaning the new customer as well as our existing customer. Operator : Our last question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So Todd, I guess, to start out. So as you look at the COVID crisis, how is your team thinking about some of the permanent benefits that's coming out of this for DG? Todd Vasos : Well, we're taking it one day at a time, as you can imagine, just like most people. We're hoping that the pandemic winds down sooner than later. But in saying that, we have seen that new customer. So we believe that's paramount is to keep her and continue to work that. But also, we're seeing real opportunity on a few other fronts. One is to enable us to accelerate our strategic initiatives, which you heard from both myself and John on as well as Jeff.  And we're very excited about that because, first of all, these initiatives were working well prior to COVID. Now they're working very well, and we know that the consumer is looking both for the goods that we are offering through these initiatives. But also because of being on the forefront of this, not that we knew COVID was coming, but knew that the customer is always looking for more of a convenient and frictionless shopping experience. And we were well out in front of this, right, 18 -- 12 to 18 months ago to create what we've created around our digital efforts and our NCI products and many other things.  So we see real opportunities there. Karen talked to -- asked about real estate. We see opportunities there, that there'll be some real estate opportunities opened up, we believe, because of this that we'll take advantage of as well. So there's a lot of areas where we know we can take advantage of. But where we're squarely focused on right now is servicing those customers that are coming in because she still really needs us because of this raging pandemic that we hope, again, winds down soon. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And one follow-up question, just on the supply chain. So one of your competitors called out some challenges with out of stocks during their quarter. So just curious where you guys are from a supply chain, especially in categories like home, where you just had really stellar growth during the quarter. Jeffery Owen : Rupesh, thank you. This is Jeff. First of all, we've said this before, but our teams are out in front of this very early. So I think it's a testament to the collaboration of our merchant team, supply chain and the operators and also the great relationships we have with our vendor partners. So we're seeing steady progress. And we still have, obviously, work to do, but what I can tell you is that the team has been very creative in finding solutions to get product on the shelf for the customer.  You've heard us say before, we've stood up new SKUs during this, items we never carried before. We've looked at different pack sizes. And so real pleased with the progress of the team. And as we look forward, and we're still suffering from some constraints. But as we look forward, we see that the supply chain that we have is incredibly nimble. And many of the initiatives we have in place have allowed us to get products in and out of the supply chain and distribution center fast. So we'll be ready for that customer when that -- when the inventory is ready for us to distribute to them. So we're pleased with the progress. Operator : This concludes Dollar General Corporation's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I'd like to start by thanking our associates for their tireless work over the past several months in helping our customers and communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite continued significant uncertainty in the operating environment, our team members have been unwavering in their commitment to fulfilling our mission of serving others by providing affordable, convenient and close-to-home access to everyday essentials, at a time when our customers need them most. I could not be more proud of their efforts. As always, the health and safety of our employees and customer continues to be our top priority. We continue to closely monitor CDC and other governmental guidelines regarding COVID-19 and are evaluating and adapting our safety protocols as that guidance evolves. As one of America's essential retailers, we remain committed to being part of the solution during these difficult times. And we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, including our expansive network of more than 17,000 stores located within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. At the same time, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth. To that end, and from a position of strength, I'm excited to share an update on some of our more recent plans. First, as you saw in our release, we plan to further accelerate our pace of new store openings and remodels in 2021. In total, we expect to execute 2,900 real estate projects next year as we continue to lay and strengthen the foundation for future growth. As previously announced, we recently introduced our newest store concept, POP SHELF, further building on our proven track record of store format innovation. We opened our first 2 locations during the quarter, and while still early, we are encouraged by their initial results. Finally, one of our core values is representing and respecting the dignity and differences of others. Building on this core value, along with our commitment to diversity and inclusion, we recently updated our fourth operating priority to better capture and express our intent. We will discuss each of these updates in more detail later in the call. But first, let's recap some of the results for the third quarter. The quarter was once again highlighted by exceptional growth on both the top and bottom lines. We're particularly pleased that, for the quarter, our 3 nonconsumable categories once again delivered a combined sales increase well in excess of our consumable business. Of note, this represents our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year comp sales growth in our nonconsumable business, which speaks to the strong and sustained momentum in these product categories.  From a multicadence perspective, comp sales for Q3 periods range from the low double digits to mid-teens, with the best performance in August, followed by modest moderation as we move through the quarter. Overall, third quarter net sales increased 17.3% to $8.2 billion, driven by comp sales growth of 12.2%. These results include significant growth in average basket size, partially offset by a decline in customer traffic, as we believe customers continue to consolidate shopping trips in an effort to limit social contact. Once again, this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales, as measured by syndicated data, driven by double-digit increases in both units and dollars. Importantly, our data suggests an increase in new customers this quarter as compared to Q3 of 2019. These new customers skew younger, higher income and more ethnically diverse, further underscoring the broadened appeal of our value and convenience proposition. We are also encouraged by the repurchase rates of new customers and are working hard to retain them with more targeted marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives. We're particularly pleased with the -- in how we delivered significant operating margin expansion, which contributed to third quarter diluted EPS of $2.31, an increase of 63% over the prior year. Collectively, our Q3 results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to create meaningful long-term shareholder value.  We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And with our unique combination of value and convenience, further enhanced through our initiatives, we believe we are well positioned to successfully navigate the current environment and emerge even stronger than before. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year and all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share.  As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a meaningful increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.3% in the third quarter, an increase of 178 basis points and represents our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from nonconsumables categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs, which were driven by increased volume and our decision to incur employee appreciation bonus expense. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.9%, a decrease of 62 basis points. Although we incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19, these costs were more than offset by the significant increase in sales. Expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales this quarter include : occupancy costs, utilities, retail labor, depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance and employee benefits. These items were partially offset by increases in incentive compensation expense and hurricane-related expenses. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter increased 57.3% to $773 million compared to $491 million in the third quarter of 2019. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.4%, an increase of 240 basis points. Operating profit in the third quarter was positively impacted by COVID-19, primarily through higher sales. The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately $38 million of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers and approximately $25 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we have invested approximately $153 million in COVID-19 related expenses, including about $99 million in appreciation bonuses for our frontline employees. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% and compares to 21.7% in the third quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted earlier, EPS for the third quarter increased 62.7% to $2.31. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers and employees during these unprecedented times, while continuing to invest for the long term. We finished the quarter with $2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $760 million compared to Q2, and an increase of $1.9 billion over the prior year. Merchandise inventories were $5 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 11.8% overall and 5.9% on a per-store basis. While out-of-stocks remain higher than normal for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with our overall inventory levels. Year-to-date through Q3, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $3.4 billion, an increase of 103.7%.  Total capital expenditures through the first 3 quarters were $698 million and included our planned investments in remodels and relocations, new stores and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares of our common stock for $902 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $88 million. At the end of Q3, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.6 billion. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2020, we continue to operate in a time of significant uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. As a result, we are not providing guidance for fiscal 2020 sales or EPS at this time and are unlikely to resume issuing guidance to the extent such uncertainties persist. With regards to share repurchases, capital spending and real estate projects, our outlook for the year remains unchanged from what we stated in our Q2 earnings release on August 27, 2020.  Let me now provide some context as to what we expect in the fourth quarter. Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in Q4. From the end of Q3 through December 1, comp sales accelerated, increasing approximately 14% during this time frame, reflecting increased demand in our consumables business. And while we remain cautious in our sales outlook, we are encouraged with our sales trends, particularly as we move farther past government stimulus payments and the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits under the CARES Act. That said, significant uncertainty still exists concerning the duration of the positive sales environment, including external factors related to the ongoing health crisis and their potential impact on our business. Beyond these macro factors, there are a number of more specific considerations as it relates to the fourth quarter. First, we anticipate higher transportation and distribution costs in Q4. Like other retailers, our business is seeing the effect of higher transportation costs due to a tight carrier market, as a result of driver shortages and a greater demand for services at third party carriers. In addition, we are in the process of building, expanding or opening a number of distribution centers across our Dry and DG Fresh networks. And while we expect these investments will enable us to drive even greater efficiencies going forward and further support future growth, these investments will pressure gross margin rates in Q4. Also, please keep in mind that the fourth quarter represents our most challenging lap of the year from a gross margin perspective, following 60 basis points of rate improvement in Q4 2019. With regards to our strategic initiatives, we continue to anticipate they will positively contribute to operating margin over time as the benefit to gross margin continues to scale and outpace the associated expense with both NCI and DG Fresh on pace to be accretive to operating margin in 2020. However, our investment in these initiatives will pressure SG&A rates in the fourth quarter, as we further accelerate their rollouts. Finally, we expect to make additional investments in the fourth quarter as a result of COVID-19, including up to $75 million in employee appreciation bonuses, which includes our recent announcement to award approximately $50 million in additional bonuses, bringing our full year investment and appreciation bonuses to approximately $173 million as well as continued investments in health and safety measures. In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and service, resulting in another quarter of exceptional results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our 4 operating priorities. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team once again did a fantastic job in Q3, executing against the portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me highlight some of our recent efforts. Starting with our cooler door expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During the first 3 quarters, we added approximately 49,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install more than 60,000 cooler doors this year, the majority of which will be in our higher capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection. Turning now to private brands, which remain a priority as we look to drive overall category awareness and even greater customer adoption through rebranding, repositioning and expansion of select brands, as well as the introduction of new product lines. We're very pleased with the continued progress across these fronts, including the successful rebranding of 6 product lines and the introduction of 2 new brands so far this year, and we're excited about the continued momentum we're seeing across the portfolio. Finally, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. During the quarter, we completed our initial rollout of this convenient customer package pickup and drop off service, which is now available in more than 8,500 stores. We're very pleased with the reception this offering is receiving from our customers, and we continue to explore innovative opportunities to further leverage our unique real estate footprint to provide even more solutions for our customers in convenient and nearby locations. Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, enhancing gross margin remains a key area of focus for us. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with our NCI, DG Fresh and private brand efforts, foreign sourcing remains an important gross margin opportunity for us.  The team, once again, did a great job during the quarter, working with our supply partners to ensure product availability. Looking ahead, we continue to pursue opportunities to increase our foreign sourcing penetration, while further diversifying our countries of origin. We also continue to pursue supply chain efficiencies, including the continued expansion of our private fleet, the opening of additional DG Fresh facilities and the recent purchase of our future Walton, Kentucky dry distribution center, which should contribute to a further reduction in stem miles beginning early next year.  In addition, we recently began construction on our first ever ground up combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Blair, Nebraska. We anticipate this facility will be completed in early 2022, enabling us to drive even greater efficiencies as we move ahead.  The team is also executing against additional opportunities to enhance gross margin, including further improvements in shrink, as we continue to build on our success with Electronic Article Surveillance. Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. As previously announced, we recently celebrated a significant milestone with the opening of our 17,000th store. This is a testament to the fantastic work of our best-in-class real estate team, as we continue to expand our footprint and enhance our ability to serve even more customers. As a reminder, our real estate model continues to focus on 5 metrics that have served us well for many years in evaluating new real estate opportunities. These metrics include new store productivity, actual sales performance, average  returns,  cannibalization and the payback period. Of note, we continue to see strong performance across these metrics. For 2020, we remained on track to open 1,000 new stores, remodel 1,670 stores and relocate 110 stores. Through the first 3 quarters, we opened 780 new stores, remodeled 1,425 stores, including more than 1,000 in the higher cooler count DGTP or DGP formats  and we relocated 76 stores. We also added produce in more than 140 stores, bringing the total number of stores which carry produce to more than 1,000. As Todd noted, for fiscal 2021, we plan to execute 2,900 real estate projects in total, including 1,050 new stores, 1,750 remodels and 100 store relocations. Additionally, we plan to add produce in approximately 600 stores. Notably, we expect approximately 50% of our new unit openings and about 75% of our remodels to be in the DGTP or DGP format. The remainder of our new store openings and remodels will primarily be in the traditional format with higher capacity coolers. Our plans also include having approximately 30 stores in our new POP SHELF concept, which Todd will discuss in more detail by the end of fiscal 2021, up from 2 locations today. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains extremely robust, and we are excited about the significant growth opportunities ahead. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we've established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as save to serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. We continue to build on our success with Fast Track, which Todd will discuss in more detail later. As a result of our efforts to date, our store associates are able to better serve our customers during this period of heightened demand as evidenced by our recent customer survey results, where we continue to see overall satisfaction scores at all-time highs. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. We have 3 business operating priorities but at the heart of them is our foundational fourth operating priority. This priority is anchored in our people, and is truly foundational to everything we do at Dollar General. Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion.  As Todd noted, this updated language more fully expresses our values and core beliefs and more closely aligns with the investments we continue to make in the development of our people. Importantly, we believe these investments continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by continued record low store manager turnover, record staffing levels, healthy applicant flows and a robust internal promotion pipeline. As a growing retailer, we also continue to create new jobs and opportunities for career advancement. In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes,  and we continue to innovate on the development opportunities we can offer our teams. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. We also so recently completed our annual community giving campaign where employees across the organization come together to raise funds for a variety of important causes. I was once again humbled by the generosity and compassion of our people. This event truly embodies the serving others culture that is so deeply embedded at Dollar General. In summary, we are executing well from a position of strength and our operating priorities continue to provide a strong foundation from which we can drive continued growth in the years ahead. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Jeff. I'm proud of the great progress the team has made in advancing our strategic initiatives. Let me take you through some of the most recent highlights. Starting with our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in 5,200 stores at the end of Q3. And given our strong execution to date, we now expect to expand the offering to more than 5,600 stores by the end of 2020, including approximately 400 stores in our NCI Light version. This compares to our prior expectation of more than 5,400 stores at year-end. We're especially pleased with the strong sales and margin performance our NCI stores, once again, delivered in the quarter. We also continue to benefit from incorporating select NCI products and planograms throughout the broader store base, and we are pleased with the performance of our light stores, which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment but through a more streamlined approach. As noted earlier, we are also excited about the recent introduction of  POP SHELF and the opening of our first 2 locations, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. POP SHELF aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience, delivered through : first, continually refreshed merchandise, primarily in targeted nonconsumable product categories; second, a differentiated in-store experience, including impactful displays of our offering, designed to create a highly visual, fun and easy shopping experience; and third, exceptional value with approximately 95% of our items priced at $5 or less. Importantly, while POP SHELF delivers many of Dollar General's core strengths, including customer insights, merchandise innovation, operational excellence, digital capabilities and real estate expertise, it is specifically tailored to a different shopping occasion, will primarily be located in suburban communities and initially targets a higher-income customer, potentially unlocking additional and incremental growth opportunities going forward. We're proud of all of the incredible work the team has done in standing up this concept. And with the initial work now behind us, we look forward to welcoming additional customers to POP SHELF as we moved forward our goal of approximately 30 stores by the end of 2021. Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. As a reminder, the primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs in our frozen and refrigerated items by removing the markup paid to third party distributors, thereby enhancing gross margin. And we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. In fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases. Importantly, we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative. Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories. We're pleased with the success we are already seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of more than 55 additional items, including both national and private brands in select stores being serviced by DG Fresh. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout plans, we plan and continue to believe DG Fresh could provide a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to even more stores in the future. In total, we were self-distributing to more than 13,000 stores from 8 DG fresh facilities at the end of Q3. We expect to capture benefits from this initiative in more than 14,000 stores from 10 facilities by the end of this year and are well on track to complete our initial rollout across the chain in 2021.  Next, our digital initiative, where our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. In an environment where customers continue to seek safe, familiar and convenient experiences, we believe our unique footprint, combined with our digital assets, provides a distinct competitive advantage. More specifically, I'm pleased to note that during the quarter, we expanded DG Pickup, our buy online, pickup in the store offering to nearly 17,000 stores compared to more than 2,500 stores at the end of Q2, providing another convenient access point for those seeking a more contactless customer experience. In addition to DG Pickup, our plans include further expansion of DG GO! checkout, as we look to make this feature available in select stores that include self-checkout, further enhancing our convenience proposition. By leading our channel in digital tools and experiences, we believe we are well positioned to drive more in-store traffic, grow basket size and offer even greater convenience to new and existing customers. Moving now to Fast Track, where our goals, including increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a result of our efforts around rolltainer optimization and even more shelf-ready packaging. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. During the quarter, we accelerated the rollout of self-checkout to more than 900 stores compared to approximately 400 stores at the end of Q2, with plans for further expansion as we move forward. And while still early, we are pleased with the initial results, including our customer adoption rates as well as positive feedback from both customers and employees. Overall, we remain focused on controlling what we can control, while taking actions, including the continued execution of our key initiatives to further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape. As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, and continue to believe we are pursuing the right strategies to capture additional growth opportunities in a rapidly changing retail landscape. In closing, we are very proud of the team's performance and our results through the first 3 quarters of 2020, which further demonstrate that our unique combination of value and convenience continues to resonate with our customers and positions us well going forward. As we are in the midst of a busy and extended holiday season, I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our more than 157,000 employees across the company for their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.  With that, operator, we'd now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. And congrats on another nice quarter. Todd, so clearly, the company is hitting on all cylinders today. What do you think DG takes from this pandemic following a vaccine? Meaning any categories that you believe the company is taking multiyear market share. What are you seeing from new customer acquisition? Just kind of thinking about the after versus, obviously, the clear momentum that you're seeing today? Todd Vasos : Thank you, Matt. That's a great question because I here at Dollar General, we're always focused on that long term, right? And we believe that through the initiatives that we have in place, including DG Fresh, including our digital assets and Fast Track, including our cooler initiatives that we continue to benefit from and feel that we are still in the early innings of the ballgame on, we feel that those will serve us very well post pandemic. And let's hope that post pandemic comes sooner than later. But as we continue to look forward, we also are encouraged on some of the early initiatives we have around POP SHELF and that concept. Because we believe that there's a fair amount of white space out there for a discretionary format, like POP SHELF. And again, I think we're encouraged as we look at the first 2 stores on what that customer response has been. On the customer acquisition side of the equation, we're very pleased with the amount of new customers that we've seen. And what really encourages us is that, that's a little different customer, one that is very adjacent to our core customer, but as I said, skews a little younger, more digital savvy and a little bit more ethnically diverse. And that really gives us the opportunity to speak to her a little differently. And I'm happy to say that, toward the end of Q3, we actually launched our new customer acquisition platform through social media and a few other means that we won't talk about exactly, we don't want to give away too much. But suffice it to say, we're happy with some of the early response that we've even seen from that. So more to come. We're doing everything that we believe is appropriate right now while we're in the midst of the pandemic to retain and keep those customers as we move into 2021. Matthew Boss : Great, and then a follow-up maybe for John. On gross margins, if I look at expansion in the last 2 quarters, you've shown 150 basis points plus relative to multi-year second and third quarter historical level. So maybe could you just elaborate on the fourth quarter factors that you mentioned and is the point that we should expect moderation in growth margin expansion? Or do you actually see these headwinds outpacing the tailwind? John Garratt : Great question, Matt. First, I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the gross margin expansion we've seen with 6 consecutive quarters of year-over-year expansion. As you mentioned, 178 this quarter. I'll  maybe start by talking about the drivers this quarter and that can help inform as we look ahead. I think it's important to note that the initiatives, like DG Fresh and NCI, are really contributing and impactful to the 3 biggest drivers we saw this quarter. First, lower markdowns. With the strong sell through on nonconsumables, we didn't have to take as much clearance markdowns as well as, as we've been talking about for a number of quarters now, we're just -- continue to be more and more targeted on promotional activity and have less promotional activity necessary. Secondly, when you look at higher initial markups, that was primarily driven by DG Fresh. We continue to see that same substantial cost takeout and that only grows as we scale. And then third, the mix benefit. Again, the key driver there was nonconsumables. Obviously, there's been a shift in wallet, but I would say that we really positioned ourselves very well with what we've done to that part of the box with the impact of NCI and spreading the learnings from that, as evidenced by the 10 consecutive quarters of noncon comps. In addition to that, we did have lower shrink, which we were pleased to see as a percent of sales. Now partly offsetting that was higher distribution and transportation costs. So as we look ahead, as you alluded to in Q4, we are not providing specific guidance given the uncertainty of the environment. But I think factors to consider, as you look ahead, consider first that we expect -- anticipate higher transportation and distribution costs in Q4 to continue with the tight carrier market and the DC startups. Also, Q2 and Q3, it certainly was enhanced by the mix shift into nonconsumables, which it's hard to say but -- when, but it's likely to moderate somewhat over time from those heightened levels. And then I think, in Q4, it's also important to note that it is the most challenging lap of the year, as we mentioned, as we're lapping 60 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q4. So while there are some uncertainties and some near-term headwinds, we continue to believe there's opportunities to increase our gross margin and operating margin over time. We continue to see a growing benefit from initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI, as I mentioned. And those will only grow as they scale. We continue to see opportunities in the levers that we talk about : category management, private brand penetration, foreign sourcing penetration, supply chain efficiencies and shrink. And while we always reserve the right to invest in price where needed, where appropriate, we're currently in a great spot on price and don't see the need to make any investments there right now. So believe we're making the right investments and have the levers to continue to improve gross margins and operating margins over the long term. Operator : Next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : And congratulations from me as well. Thinking -- and I hate to focus on 2021, but I think that's what everyone is kind of concerned about as it relates to the tough compares.  And -- so I wanted to ask a couple of questions. I appreciate there's a lot of unknowns. But is there any way to kind of provide a framework with respect to puts and takes? And I would ask that in the context of while I understand you definitely can't predict sales, how are you thinking about freight into 2021 year-over-year? And then how are you thinking about wages specifically? Because you outlined, I guess, $173 million in bonuses, but you also probably will have around $53 million in COVID expenses. But once you've offered these bonuses, how do you think about taking them away? Maybe a little color on both of those would be great. Todd Vasos : Karen, let me start, and then I'll have John chime in as well here. As we look out to 2021, again, we're really squarely focused on is controlling what we can control. And that is really in our key initiatives, ensuring that we execute at a high level, retain as many of these new customers as we possibly can through the means that we have talked about and also, again, with our key initiatives being a nice backdrop to that new consumer.  She can do a much fuller shop inside of our store than she ever has been able to do in the past. As you start to think about 2021 and the labor side, to your point, wages, again, we don't have a crystal ball, so we don't know exactly what the pandemic is going to look like in the first part of the year, or how fast this vaccine will be given.  We've got some hints, obviously, from the CDC and through the government. But the one thing I think just to take away is that, we are going to do what's right by our employees first, right? And so we'll continue to watch that. We'll continue to keep them safe through this pandemic until a vaccine is widely available. And if we do need to pay additional bonuses to reward our frontline workers for taking care of the customers, then we'll do that. But again, I think it's too early to tell in Q1 exactly what's going to happen at this point. John Garratt : Yes. I think the only thing I'll add to that, as you mentioned, it's challenging in this uncertain environment, given the fluid nature of the pandemic and the impact that can have on the economy and the consumer to say what sales look like. But to Todd's point, what we're focused on is controlling what we can control, and that's accelerating virtually all our strategic initiatives, which we feel great about and are really pleased with what we're seeing them contribute to the top line and the bottom line. And again, those will continue to have an increased impact as we scale those. And so we're focused on that as well as, as Todd alluded to, doing whatever we can to take care of those customers, those new customers trading in, to keep them coming back as they've indicated they intend to and also keeping those baskets gets bigger. And I think what we've done to make the box more relevant than ever providing that fuller fill in trip positions us well. So focused on controlling what we can control. In terms of puts and takes, we feel great about, I'll tell you, the fundamentals of the business, the strength of the business model, the initiatives and having a model that performs well in all cycles of the economy. In terms of a couple of specific things you mentioned. You mentioned freight, and it remains to be seen. I think a big part of freight is the capacity constraint right now and the heightened volume. So it remains to be seen. That's something that -- this is the time of the year with the holiday seasons, it's usually at its peak. And certainly, all the volume is straining that now. Hopefully, that is something that would normalize over time. And certainly, we have a lot of mitigating efforts to go after that in terms of further scaling our private fleet, continuing to expand and diversify our carrier base and then ongoing efforts around stem mile reduction, load optimization and DC productivity efforts.  And then the other thing I pointed to in Q4 around gross margin is, we have, over the last 2 quarters, gotten additional benefit from that mix shift into nonconsumables. We feel fantastic about the nonconsumables business as we continue to scale NCI, as we continue to import the best ideas from that to the rest of the chain. So we feel great about that piece of the business, but it remains to be seen if you can continue to get that kind of mix shift and would imagine that, that would, over time, moderate somewhat. And so I think that's just some of the considerations for next year, but I feel fantastic about the fundamentals of the business. Karen Short : Okay. If I could just ask one more. Is there any pattern or anything you could point to on performance of rural versus urban stores? And then -- in the quarter, but then also with the acceleration that you saw into the quarter-to-date? Any pattern to point out there other than consumables accelerating in 4Q? Jeffery Owen : Karen, this is Jeff. In terms of the rural versus urban, the nice thing about our model is consistency really across the store base. But specifically to rural, we did see our rural stores perform well and outperformed our urban stores. So we're pleased with that performance and continue to be real pleased with our remodel program, our new store development program and the fact that we're within 75 -- 75% of the U.S. population is within 5 miles of our store network. So that unique footprint continues to serve us well.  You mentioned about the trends in terms of the sales piece. We did mention, as John said earlier in our prepared remarks around the sales. And so we're pleased, we're ready for the fourth quarter. I can tell you that in terms of the team's ability to set holiday. We've made great improvements in our in-stock position and the inventory side. So we are certainly ready to serve that customer and excited about the remaining parts of the fourth quarter. Operator : Next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : A little bit along the lines of Karen's question, maybe unanswerable around 2021. I want to ask through the lens of the top line. And in the past, you've been fairly deliberate around some of your sales drivers, like bottoms-up, new store remodels, sales initiatives. I think we talked about a recession uplift. And all of this is on top of, I think, normally, some inflation. Are you still thinking about '21 in this way? Can you share your thoughts on any of these items? And then I don't know how you think about stimulus, if that's part of a sales plan or not for next year? Todd Vasos : Yes, Simeon, as we look at the sales number for '21, again, way early. We're not giving any guidance here yet by any means. But I would tell you that a lot of the long-term algorithms are still well intact. Our new store algorithm is still very strong. As you saw, we're going to be opening more stores next year at the same and accelerated pace. And I think that should show you that we're very, very pleased with our store performance -- our new store performance. And quite frankly, our remodel program accelerating next year is also a great sign that we're seeing tremendous value, and our consumers are seeing tremendous value coming out of those remodels. So all of the fundamentals around the top line, including our initiative drivers, are well intact. Stimulus, we'll have to wait and see. We don't want to guess what may or may not come. But any stimulus that does come would be a tailwind for us, and I'm sure many retailers. But we'll watch and see what happens there. We're not betting on that right now until we see it. What we are big on here, and I'll keep saying it, is controlling what we can control, and that is driving that top line through our long-term strategic initiatives.  And I think they have served us well over the many years and are set up to serve us well for many years to come. Simeon Gutman : My follow-up, it's related to margin. The second call out in the release, the initial higher markups. I think we presume that's the DG Fresh. And Todd, I think in your prepared comments, you said it's building, and that's my question. I wanted to ask if you could talk about the rate of, I guess, sequential momentum there because, I think, it was initially called out in last year's fourth quarter. And so trying to think about how that ramps into '21, is it ratably, or is there some step change that we should expect from that item alone next year? Todd Vasos : Yes. I think the way to think about that is -- and you're exactly right that, that is the primary driver of that initial markup benefit that we've been talking about for a number of quarters now. It's already accretive to the business. And to your point, it will grow over time, not only literally as you add more stores, but you have economies of scale as you serve more stores from existing DCs, as you get the efficiencies of operating that -- the team, it's been amazing how quickly we've gotten this up and running and gotten quite efficient at this. So you get both benefits. So it continues to grow as it scales, both in terms of the gross margin benefit, that substantial cost take out. But then the other thing we've talked about is, is the sales benefit. We are already seeing in those stores served by our self-distribution, better in-stocks, better sales, and that's -- we expect that to grow -- that benefit to grow. And then the other thing is now we're free to improve the assortment.  We had agreements before, which precluded us from carrying certain competing brands in private label. This opened that up, and as we mentioned, we're already adding new SKUs there. And then longer term, it unlock -- we see the opportunity to unlock further expansion of produce to more stores. And so we think it's the gift that keeps on giving, both in terms of cost and margin, but also in terms of sales. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : So Dollar General reported a 17.5% comp year-to-date. If you had to guess or maybe put some analysis behind it, how much of that 17.5% is due to market share gains? And then how much is due to other factors like wallet share gains? Todd Vasos : Yes. We're not going to probably, Michael, get into too much of that due to competitive reasons, obviously. But I would tell you that we're really happy with the share gains that we've seen. Those share gains are -- continue to come from a multitude of different disciplines that are out there. Drug continues to be the largest share donor that we've seen. But some new emerging trends that we've seen and have some evidence of is that in the discretionary areas, we're taking some share at a rapid rate as well. And in many cases, that's probably from some of the consolidation that has happened on that side of the equation recently. And so couple that with our initiatives around NCI and now POP SHELF, I believe we're well positioned as we move into '21 to capitalize and keep those customers that we're seeing there in the share gains that we've already gotten in 2020. Michael Lasser : Got it. And then my follow-up question is around your expectations, your initial thoughts on as there is a slower environment for consumable retail, presumably the promotional environment is going to increase. And would you use price and all the good margin expansion potential that you have and reinvest that back in price to gain a disproportionate amount of market share in a softer consumer -- consumable environment overall? Todd Vasos : Well, we always say we always reserve the right to lower price to ensure that we keep those footsteps coming into Dollar General, and more importantly, service that consumer. As we sit right now, though, Michael, we don't see any evidence and/or need to pull a price lever. The promotional activity, the everyday price activity across retail right now seems to be pretty tame and about the same as it has been for many quarters now. But as we continue to watch the environment, we'll do whatever we have to do to ensure that we're priced right. But I think it's also important to note, in the 12 years that I've been here, this is the best competitive positioning we've ever been in on price, the very best. So from a position of strength, we've already lowered price, got it where it needs to be and is in -- and are in very good shape as we move into 2021. Operator : The next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Curious if you could talk about some of the new customers that you've acquired earlier in the year. And if there are any retention metrics that you might have that you can share? And then second, just going back to your comments about lower markdowns. Just curious if that was true across both consumables and nonconsumables? And if you could talk about the gross margins within each of those businesses relative to themselves a year ago? Jeffery Owen : Sure. This is Jeff. First, on the new customer retention metrics you asked about, as Todd earlier stated, we're really pleased with the launch of our retention strategy that we did at the tail end of Q3. So first, I got to tell you, it's a little early, but one of the things here at Dollar General that we do very well is, we measure everything, and we are very focused on monitoring our efforts so that we can pivot if we need to or we can accelerate if we need to.  And so what I can tell you is, is that initially, we're pleased with what we're seeing from the new customer retention strategy that we put in place. We think it's the right time to do that. When you think about that, not only from when we started acquiring new customers, call it, 6 months or so ago, and then also thinking about that as it relates to 2021 and our desire to try to retain as many as we can. So very pleased with the surgical digital approach that we're taking. Rest assured, we are measuring that. And I think, at a future your date, we'll be able to talk more about that. But right now, it's a little bit early. And then I'll toss it to John on the margin question. John Garratt : Yes. On the markdowns, it really is both. We've been talking about lower markdowns as a percent of sales for a number of quarters. And the driver of that has been lower promotional activity. The team has gotten very targeted and got very sophisticated in the tools we've put in place and the processes to really go after what gives us the biggest bang for the buck, what really moves the needle on true incrementality of traffic and profitability. And so that's been throughout. But with the strength -- growing strength of nonconsumables and the better sell-through there, we have then, more recently, seen a reduction in the amount of clearance activity required to clear those goods. So it really is both consumables and nonconsumables. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I want to go back to the launch of the POP SHELF concept. I am just curious in terms of the decision to launch the new concept right now during the pandemic, is that driven by maybe more real estate opportunities, or just any more color you can provide there? Todd Vasos : Sure. As you can imagine, any concept of this magnitude, the work had begun long before COVID, the pandemic, or any of that. Probably, as you really dial the clock back about 18 months or so ago, really started that process. And I would tell you that the plan all along was to launch about this time that we launched it. So we were very much right on track to our initial launch times. Now, obviously, we didn't anticipate the pandemic that -- what we didn't anticipate either was the abundance of available real estate that would be out there. And that's been a real positive for us with some of the consolidation that we've seen from discretionary retailers that may no longer be in business at this point. We've seen some real opportunity to grab some very good real estate that we're able to open up this concept in. And that's why we're pretty bullish on the 30 by the end of 2021, both from a real estate perspective, but also the initial sales of this concept, at least in the first 2 stores, has been very, very strong and exceeding our expectations. So again, hitting on all cylinders on the initiative so far, but again, it's early. But rest assured, we are -- we'll do what we do best here at Dollar General, and that's executed at a high level and continue to refine this new concept to make it the best it can be. Rupesh Parikh : Great. Maybe just one follow-up question. Any thoughts you can share in terms of what you guys are seeing thus far in the holiday season and how it's performing versus expectations? And I know your quarter-to-date trends accelerated, if you're to be driven by the consumables category. I was just curious if you think that the November -- almost the November performance was -- represented any pull forward of demand? Todd Vasos : Sure. I think it's a little early to talk about what Q4 is going to look like in totality, a lot of selling left, month of December for retail, obviously, is very big. I don't have to mention that, but I will. But when you start to look at our numbers, the great thing that we saw was, our traffic numbers in November started to rebound pretty nicely, really came back to where we saw some of those traffic numbers in Q2. And so that was a great sign for us that the consumer was out shopping, not only the consumable side of the business, but the nonconsumable or discretionary side of that equation as well.  The other thing, and Jeff alluded to it in part of his comments earlier, we really leaned in on inventory for Q4 around holiday. We knew it was going to be a good holiday season for Dollar General. We went in, bought more inventory from the closeout market mainly, and we are in some of our best inventory positions in holiday that we've been in, in many years and are very encouraged by the early sell-through of what we've seen in holiday. So encouraged, but a lot of selling left to go. Operator : Thank you. And thank you to everyone who's joined us today. This will conclude today's teleconference.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our strong finish to fiscal 2020, and I thank all of our associates for their extraordinary efforts over the past year to support our customers, our communities and each other. Despite a challenging operating environment, our team remains steadfast in their dedication to fulfilling our mission of Serving Others by providing affordable, convenient and close to home access to everyday essentials. And I could not be more proud of their efforts. Throughout the pandemic, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees and customers while meeting the critical needs of the communities we serve as an essential retailer. In response to the COVID pandemic, we implemented several safety protocols; enhanced our benefits and leave policies; invested in personnel and personnel protective equipment; dedicated certain store hours for the most vulnerable members of our communities; and most recently, removed barriers for our frontline associates to receive the vaccine. In total, we invested approximately $248 million in response to the pandemic in 2020, including about $167 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees to demonstrate our appreciation for their exceptional performance during an incredibly challenging year. At Dollar General, we remain committed to being part of the solution and believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our network of more than 17,000 stores located within 5 miles of approximately 75% of U.S. population. At the same time, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth. To that end, we're excited to share an update on some of our plans for 2021. First, we plan to further the rollout of several value-creating initiatives, including our nonconsumables initiative, Fast Track and the completion of our initial rollout of DG Fresh. In addition, while still early, we are very pleased with the results of our POP SHELF stores, which have far exceeded our initial expectations for both sales and gross margin. As a result, we plan to accelerate our pace of new store openings for POP SHELF in 2021 and expect to incorporate this concept into a number of our larger-format Dollar General locations as we look to capitalize on the significant growth opportunity we see for this differentiated concept. We are also pleased to highlight key changes to our development strategy, including plans to build on the success of our Dollar General Plus store, or DGP, and the introduction of 2 new store formats, which we began testing in 2020. Similar to our larger-footprint DGP concept, the first new format has a selling space of approximately 8,500 square feet, which compares to about 7,300 square feet of selling space for our traditional store. Beginning later this year, this new format, along with our DGP concept, will become our base prototype for nearly all new stores, replacing both our traditional and higher cooler count DGTP formats, allowing for a more optimized assortment and room to accommodate future growth. Our second new format is even larger with approximately 9,500 square selling feet and will be deployed opportunistically across new store, relocation and remodel opportunities. Notably, on average, our DGP and new store formats are outperforming the chain on a comp sales basis and have considerably higher sales volumes compared to both the traditional and DGTP store, which bodes well for the future as we look to increase their unit counts in the years ahead. Finally, we are pleased to provide an update on a number of our new small box store opportunities we see available in the continental United States, which represents an increase compared to our prior estimate. Jeff will discuss these updates in more detail later in the call. But first, let's recap some of the highlights for the fourth quarter and full year. The quarter was once again highlighted by strong growth on both the top and bottom lines. We're pleased that for the quarter, our 3 nonconsumable categories once again delivered a combined comp sales increase well in excess of our consumable business. Of note, this represents our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year comp sales growth in our combined nonconsumable categories, which we believe speaks to the strong and sustained momentum in these product categories. From a multi-cadence perspective, comp sales in December increased in the high single-digit range, with similar mid-teens growth in both November and January. In total, fourth quarter net sales increased 17.6% to $8.4 billion, primarily driven by comp sales growth of 12.7%. These results include significant growth in average basket size and units in particular, partially offset by a decline in customer traffic. And while customers continue to consolidate trips, on average, they are spending more with us compared to last year. Once again, this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data driven by a meaningful increase in both units and dollars. Importantly, our data suggests an increase in new customers this quarter as compared to Q4 of 2019. These new customers continue to skew younger, higher income and more ethnically diverse, underscoring the broadened appeal of our value and convenience proposition. We continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers, and we are working to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives. We're particularly pleased that we delivered significant operating margin expansion, which contributed to fourth quarter diluted EPS of $2.62, an increase of 24.8% over the prior year. For the full year, net sales increased 21.6% to $33.7 billion, including net sales growth of 28.1% in our combined nonconsumable categories. Comp sales for the year increased 16.3%, representing our 31st consecutive year of same-store sales growth. In 2020, we celebrated the opening of our 17,000th store and the launch of our newest store concept, POP SHELF. In total, we completed a record 2,780 real estate projects during the year, exceeding our initial target of 2,580 projects as we continue to build and strengthen the foundation for future growth. From a position of strength, we also made targeted investments in other key areas, including the acceleration of certain strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position and further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape. Collectively, our fourth quarter and full year results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value. As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock additional growth opportunities as we move forward. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And in an environment where customers continue to seek safe and convenient experiences, we believe our unique store footprint, further enhanced through our multiyear initiatives, provides a distinct competitive advantage and positions us well for continued success. Overall, I am proud of our associates and all that we've achieved over the past year. We feel very good about the underlying business and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.5% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 77 basis points, which represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to : a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from nonconsumable categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by : increased transportation and distribution costs, which were impacted by increased volume, some of which is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher transportation rates and discretionary employee bonus expense for our distribution center and private fleet employees. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.2%, an increase of 48 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by incremental costs related to COVID-19, including appreciation bonuses paid to our frontline retail employees and health and safety-related expenses as well as increased incentive compensation expense and hurricane-related expenses. These items were partially offset by certain expenses, which were lower as a percentage of sales, including occupancy costs, retail labor and depreciation and amortization. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $872 million. As a percent of sales, operating profit was 10.4%, an increase of 30 basis points. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was positively impacted by COVID-19, primarily through higher sales. The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately $96 million or 110 basis points of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including approximately $69 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees and additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% and compares to 23% in the fourth quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted earlier, EPS for the fourth quarter increased 24.8% to $2.62, which contributed to full year EPS of $10.62, an increase of 59.9%. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers and employees during these unprecedented times while continuing to invest for the long term and provide meaningful returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $5.2 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 12.2% overall and 6.3% on a per-store basis. While a lot of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with our overall inventory levels. In 2020, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $3.9 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion or 73.2%. Total capital expenditures for the year were $1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock for $900 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $87 million. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization, we have remaining authorization of approximately $2.4 billion under the repurchase program. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. Moving to our financial outlook for 2021. We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. Despite continued uncertainty, we are providing select annual guidance in an effort to provide the best view we reasonably can, based on what we currently know. That said, there could be a number of potential headwinds and tailwinds this year, which are not incorporated into our guidance as the timing, degree and potential impacts on our business are currently unclear, including, but not limited to : the recently approved government stimulus package, other unknown external factors related to the ongoing health crisis, including its impact on consumer behavior and additional changes to minimum wage rates. With this in mind, we currently expect the following for 2021 : net sales in the range of a 2% decline to flat; a same-store sales decline of 4% to 6% but which reflects growth of approximately 10% to 12% on a 2-year stack basis; and EPS in the range of $8.80 to $9.50, which reflects a compound annual growth rate between 15% and 20%, or between 14% and 19% on an adjusted basis over a 2-year period, which is well above our long-term goal of delivering at least 10% annual EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%. Capital spending is expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth. With regards to shareholder returns, as outlined in today's press release, our Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.42 per share, which represents an increase of 16.7%. We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $1.8 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our strong liquidity position and confidence about the long-term growth opportunity for our business. Finally, as noted in today's press release, our outlook for 2021 real estate projects remains unchanged from what we stated in our Q3 earnings release on December 3, 2020. Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our expectations. Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in Q1. Despite approximately 8,400 lost store operating days as a result of closures due to winter weather across the country, same-store sales for the month of February increased 5.7%, reflecting a healthy comp sales increase of 11.2% on a 2-year stack basis. From the end of February through March 16, comp sales decreased approximately 16% as we are in the midst of lapping our most difficult monthly comp sales comparison of the year. As a reminder, comp sales growth for the month of March in 2020 was 34.5%. Looking ahead, we remain cautious in our 2021 sales outlook, given the continued significant uncertainty that still exists as well as the unique comparisons against last year. That said, as you think about the sales cadence of 2021, our performance is expected to be stronger in the second half, given a more difficult sales comparison in the first half and particularly in Q1. Turning to gross margin. In 2020, gross margins benefited from a greater proportion of sales coming from our higher-margin nonconsumable categories, driven by a full year net sales percentage increase of these categories well in excess of our consumables business. We expect our sales mix will ultimately shift towards our consumables categories in 2021, resulting in pressure on our rate. However, the timing of when this dynamic may occur and its corresponding impact to gross margin are currently uncertain. Gross margins in 2020 also benefited from a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rates as a result of significant customer demand in seasonal and other clearance-sensitive nonconsumable categories. In 2021, we expect our markdown rates will increase somewhat from the abnormally low levels we saw in 2020, which likely will create some gross margin pressure compared to last year. In addition, while we continue to see the effect of higher carrier rates and fuel costs, our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce expenses, including further expansion of our private fleet, are expected to help partially mitigate these cost pressures in 2021. Also, please keep in mind that the second and third quarters represent the most challenging laps of the year from a gross profit rate perspective, following improvements of 167 basis points in Q2 2020 and 178 basis points in Q3 2020. In terms of SG&A, while we expect to incur ongoing expenses related to the pandemic in 2021, overall, we anticipate a meaningful reduction in COVID-19-related costs compared to last year. However, the leverage from these reduced costs is expected to be offset by deleverage associated with lower comp sales and approximately $60 million to $70 million in incremental year-over-year investments related to our strategic initiatives as we further the rollouts. With regard to our strategic initiatives, in aggregate, we anticipate they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associate expense. Finally, we estimate operating profit will be negatively impacted by approximately $35 million to $40 million in Q1 as a result of lost sales from storage closures and expenses related to the widespread winter weather that we experienced in February. In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and performance, which resulted in exceptional fourth quarter and full year results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities, including our strategic initiatives and plans for 2021. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did a fantastic job in 2020, executing against our portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me highlight some of our more recent efforts as we look to further build on our progress in 2021.  Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in more than 5,800 stores at the end of 2020, including nearly 400 stores in our light version. This compares to our prior expectation of more than 5,600 stores at year-end. Given our strong performance to date, we plan to expand this offering to about 5,700 additional stores this year, bringing the total number of NCI stores to more than 11,000 by year-end. This total includes over 2,100 stores in our light version, which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment but through a more streamlined approach. Moving to our newest concept, POP SHELF, which further builds on our success in learnings with NCI. POP SHELF aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience, delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with about 95% of our items priced at $5 or less. We opened our first 5 locations in 2020. And as Todd mentioned, given our strong results to date, we plan to accelerate the rollout of POP SHELF in 2021. In fact, we are now targeting to have a total of up to 50 POP SHELF stores opened by year-end compared to our previous goal of about 30 total locations. In addition to these stores, we also plan to incorporate this concept in up to 25 Dollar General stores in 2021. In terms of our store-within-a-store concept, a smaller footprint POP SHELF shop will be prominently positioned in the center of the store, and we will display both Dollar General and POP SHELF branding on exterior entrances to build and maximize awareness. From these initial stores, our goal is to test, learn and ultimately expand to more locations over time as we look to leverage the unique strengths of these complementary formats and build on our early success with POP SHELF by making it more available to a broader range of customers. Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. In fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases, and we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative. Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories. We are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of new products in select stores being serviced by DG Fresh. Given our success to date, we are further accelerating the rollout of additional offerings with the recent introduction of even more products, including both national and private brands as we look to further optimize our assortment while increasing our relevance with customers. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout plans, we believe DG fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time as we look to further capitalize on our extensive self-distribution capabilities. In total, we were self-distributing to more than 16,000 stores from 10 facilities at the end of 2020. This compares to our previous expectation of over 14,000 stores at year-end. Overall, we remain well on track to complete our initial rollout across the chain in 2021. Moving to our cooler expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During 2020, we added more than 62,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2021 as we continue to build on our multiyear track record for growth in cooler doors and associated sales. As a reminder, in 2019, we began incorporating high-capacity coolers into the majority of our new, remodeled and relocated stores, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver a wider product selection, all enabled by DG Fresh. Next, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. This convenient customer package pickup and dropoff service is now available in over 8,500 stores, with plans to be in a total of over 9,500 stores by year-end, further advancing our long track record of serving rural communities. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI and DG Fresh, we continue to pursue additional opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing and supply chain efficiencies. With regards to our supply chain, our plans for 2021 include further expansion of our private fleet, which accounted for more than 20% of our outbound fleet at the end of 2020. Reducing stem miles is also an important contributor to these efforts, and the recent opening of our Walton, Kentucky dry distribution center is expected to drive additional efficiencies as we move ahead. We also plan to open 2 additional DG Fresh facilities in 2021 as we look to further optimize our fresh network and support future growth. In addition, we anticipate our combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Blair, Nebraska will be completed in late 2022,  which should contribute to a further reduction in stem miles over time. Finally, while we are very pleased with our progress in 2020, shrink reduction remains an important area of opportunity. We continue to build on our success with electronic article surveillance by increasing the number of items tagged while further leveraging technology to drive even higher levels of in-store execution. Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. In 2020, we completed a total of 2,780 real estate projects, including 1,000 new stores, 1,670 remodels and 110 relocations. Additionally, we now have produce in more than 1,100 stores. For 2021, we expect to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores, representing 2,900 real estate projects in total. We also plan to add produce in approximately 700 stores, bringing the total number of stores that carry produce to more than 1,800. In addition, as Todd noted earlier, we continue to advance the evolution of our store base with plans to build on the success of our DGP format, including the introduction of 2 new format types. With about 8,500 square feet of selling space, both our first new format and DGP concept allow for expanded higher capacity cooler counts, an extended queue line and a broader product assortment, including NCI, a larger health and beauty section and produce in select stores. In total, we expect more than 550 of our overall real estate projects this year to be in one of these format types as we look to further enhance our value and convenience proposition, particularly in rural America. The second new format consists of about 9,500 square feet of selling space. In addition to an extended queue line and broader assortment, this larger layout also includes nearly 50 high-capacity coolers and expanded produce offering, fresh meat and additional checkout lanes, including a self-checkout bullpen with multiple stations. We believe this even larger format better positions us to meet the growing needs of our customers, particularly in highly underserved markets, and we are targeting more than 100 locations by year-end. Overall, these larger formats allow us to incorporate our best and most impactful initiatives and are designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format all while continuing to drive strong returns. Moving to an update on the number of new store opportunities. Through a combination of our growing relevance with customers, format innovation, an evolving retail landscape and leveraging new technologies, we estimate there are now approximately 13,000 additional small-box store opportunities in the continental U.S. which are available for a Dollar General store. This compares to our prior estimate of nearly 12,000 opportunities and is inclusive of our 2021 new unit pipeline. Although these opportunities are available to all small-box retailers, as a leader in small-box retail, combined with our proven track record of new unit development and format innovation, we believe we are well positioned to capture a disproportionate share as we move ahead. And while we continue to evaluate, we are currently -- we currently estimate POP SHELF could add approximately 3,000 additional store opportunities in the Continental U.S., with about another 1,000 additional opportunities available for our smaller footprint DGX format. When taken together, we estimate there are a total of approximately 17,000 new store opportunities available across our format types, which we believe represents a long runway for new unit growth. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and we are excited about the significant new store opportunities ahead. Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our brick-and-mortar footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance the customer in-store experience. Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem that is specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. We made significant progress in 2020, highlighted by the accelerated rollout of DG Pickup, our Buy Online Pick Up In-store offering to more than 17,000 stores, providing another convenient access point for those seeking a more contactless shopping experience. During the year, we also saw continued growth in customer engagement across our digital ecosystem, including our digital coupon offering, shopping list feature, cart calculator shopping and budgeting tool, e-commerce site, DG GO! mobile checkout and our mobile app, which ended the year with nearly 4 million monthly active users. Looking ahead, our plans include providing more relevant, meaningful and personalized offerings, with the goal of driving even higher levels of customer engagement and loyalty. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we've established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a result of our efforts around both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which have led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 1,600 stores at the end of 2020, with plans for an aggressive expansion as we move ahead. In fact, we expect to introduce this offering into the vast majority of our stores by the end of 2022. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs in the communities we serve. And for those associates already on our team, this growth is resulting in numerous opportunities for career advancement. In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes, and we continue to innovate on the development opportunities we can offer our teams, including continued expansion of our private fleet and those associated with DG Fresh as well as POP SHELF. In addition, we transitioned to a virtual learning environment in 2020, resulting in the continued development of our people, including nearly 3 million training hours for our employees, all supported by our award-winning training and development programs. Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by continued record low store manager turnover, record staffing levels, healthy applicant flows and a robust internal promotion pipeline. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. Overall, we are making great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. We have a robust set of initiatives in place for 2021 and are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating meaningful value for our shareholders. In closing, I am proud of our team's performance and our 2020 results, which further demonstrate our unique combination of value and convenience, continues to resonate with customers and positions us well going forward. I want to offer my heartfelt thank you to each of our more than 157,000 employees across the company for the incredible work they do every day to fulfill our mission of serving others. I look forward to all that we can accomplish together in the year ahead. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Lasser : So it looks like you're guiding to about 60 basis points of operating margin expansion between 2019 and 2021. Why wouldn't it be more than that? Given you're comping better than your algorithm would suggest on a 2-year stack basis, plus you're benefiting from all these margin-enhancing initiatives like DG Fresh, Fast Track, NCI and others. And how -- within that, how would you expect your gross margin to shake out this year versus 2019? John Garratt : Yes, so I'll tackle both those questions, Michael. This is John. First of all, I'd say we're really pleased with what we did in 2020, expanding our operating margin 223 basis points. We didn't give specific guidance on operating margin or the components. But we did call out that some of the headwinds, the biggest headwind being the SG&A deleverage that goes along with lower comp sales this year. We also talked about anticipating a mix shift back toward consumables, which does have a margin impact to both the sales mix as well as markdowns, as we would be lapping unusually low clearance markdowns last year. And then we also mentioned higher carrier rates and fuel costs. So these are all costs that pressure operating margin overall. Now you also asked about gross margin. As you think about gross margin, again, we feel great about what we did this year, delivering 77 basis points of gross margin expansion. This is our seventh consecutive quarter doing that, 117 basis points for the year. And to your point, initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI are really contributing and impactful to the biggest drivers that we called out. The 3 biggest drivers we called out were lower markdowns, higher initial markups and the mix benefit in NCI and DG Fresh were significant contributors to those. But we also, as I mentioned, are seeing, in the near term, higher distribution and transportation costs. So as we look ahead in the near term, these will weigh in the near term. But as you look at the longer term, we do feel like we're well positioned to continue expanding -- resume expanding gross margin and operating margin over the longer term for the reasons you mentioned, the scaling of these initiatives that are the gifts that keep on giving and all the levers we've talked about before within gross margin and within SG&A. But at the same time, it's noted that we continue to invest in the business. And so to make sure we sustain our ambition of being 10% double-digit EPS growers over the long term, we are continuing, as we called out, to reinvest in the business. We mentioned $60 million to $70 million that's hitting SG&A next year. And then the other thing I'll mention is in terms of COVID expenses, we will continue to have some COVID expenses associated with protecting and ensuring the health and safety of our employees and customers. How much that is going to be varies on what the situation dictates. But we've captured all our best estimates in the guidance for these drivers. Michael Lasser : Understood. That's very helpful. And my second question is very myopic. And we're all just trying to figure out what's going to happen as we get through the next several months. And if we just take the math of down 16% versus the 34.5% in March of last year, it would imply a high teens 2-year stack. So can you give us some flavor for how March unfolded last year? Have you -- are you just now entering the toughest compares within the month such that a high teens 2-year stack would be kind of a false positive indication on what to expect over the next few months? John Garratt : Yes. I can help you there, Michael. I'll start by saying it's bumpy, right? There's a lot of noise. You had the storm in February. And then in March, you're extrapolating over a very short period of time, which was pretty bumpy last year. But to help you out here, we called out, yes, as you mentioned, the negative 16% month-to-date from the end of February through March 16 this year. If you look at the corresponding period of time last year, it was not dissimilar to the 34.5% comp where we ended the period, so fairly representative. But again, there's a fair bit of noise within this so I'd be cautious in extrapolating too much based on that. But hopefully, that helps you understand where we were at this point. Michael Lasser : That certainly does. Good luck. Operator : Our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : A couple of questions. I guess, first, on the comps. The 10% to 12% that you mentioned in the release on a 2-year stack, it actually felt like that's a doable number going forward if you take all the initiatives. And so -- yet you're still going to have stimulus, at least in the first part of the year, probably now and for a little while longer. And so I guess the top line feels a little conservative in that regard. Just can you talk about that? Any thoughts around it? Why -- if the 10% to 12%, in our view, is doable, why couldn't the top line end up being a little bit stronger? John Garratt : Sure. Let me unpack that for you. And again, just dialing the clock back a little bit, we've said historically that this model works really well at a 2% to 4% comp. That's the engine of the 10%-plus EPS growth algorithm. So with a 2-year comp stack of 10% to 12% over 2 years, that represents a pretty meaningful step-change improvement over that. And I tell you, we feel great about the fundamentals of the business. As you said, the relevance of the brand, the broadening appeal, the new customers we've brought in, the bigger baskets we're enjoying, I'd say the business model has never been stronger. And as noted, the initiatives are really clicking and contributing to this relevance. So we feel good about the guidance that we've provided. But we did note that -- and it's based on what we know, but what we did note was that we didn't include the impact of stimulus because it's really relatively unknown what impact it will have, to what degree it might help. So that's not taken into consideration in the guidance. It could be an upside. I hope it is. But there's just a lot of uncertainty when you think about : one, compared to the previous stimulus rounds, which helped us, the economy is opening up now more. And so we are competing with other segments of the economy outside of retail for that share of wallet. So how much we get is uncertain. And then the other piece is surveys of consumers have said that they plan to save more this time. They plan to spend more paying off bills. Now a lot of times, what people say and do is 2 different things and so it remains to be seen if that's the case. So we're cautiously optimistic. We didn't build it in. It could be an upside, but it's just very difficult to say if it will be upside and to what degree. Simeon Gutman : Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up, and maybe take another shot at something Michael just asked. If you look at the gross margins versus 2019, and John, you mentioned some transportation costs, is there any reason why they shouldn't be higher than 2019? John Garratt : Yes. Again, I don't want to get into the specifics of guidance around operating margin for this year. We wanted to give -- there's a high degree of uncertainty, we wanted to give some guidance that we gave the top line and the bottom line. I'll just say that we're really pleased with the performance we've been delivering over the last few years, growing our gross margin and the operating margin again over 2 points this year. But again, there's a lot of unknown this year, a lot of potential pressures. With that comp that we mentioned, when you look at this year, that does create some deleverage. And again, we are investing in the business. Now again, that investment piece is accretive, but then you do have other pressures such as carrier rates, and then obviously, you do have other inflationary pressures. Operator : Our next question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So Todd or John, maybe on the same-store sales acceleration to the mid -- that we've seen so far, what have you seen from discretionary versus consumables? And then on the double-digit 2-year stack that you forecasted for this year, how much of the acceleration, relative to the past 2 years, do you believe is driven by new customer acquisition or market share gains? Trying to get a sense for that 2-year stack of double digits relative to mid- to high single digits, the trailing 2 years. How much of this acceleration do you believe is sustainable? Todd Vasos : Yes. This is Todd. Yes, I would tell you, let me take the second part first. I would tell you that, that comp, we believe that we are retaining a nice portion of the new customers that we saw come in. We can see that with our data at a pretty good real-time rate. And the great thing is, we've seen them continue to come back, so repeat as well. So we feel good about that going into '21. We see them still here in '21, which is really good to see. And again, with all of our initiatives that we've got put together, I would tell you that it gives her a lot of confidence to continue to shop with us. So I know I'm not going to give you exactly what you're looking for, but I would tell you that it plays a portion of it. But I would also say that all of our initiatives also really come into play here. And then what we've seen so far, just to give you a little bit more color, nonconsumables or that discretionary side of the business continues to do very well for us into the early part of Q1 here. And as we move through March, it will become even more meaningful because as you recall, the stock-up trip from last year, with the pandemic, with paper and cleaning and many of the consumable, food, perishable areas really took off last year and nonconsumables were a little soft, quite frankly. And we're seeing the opposite, quite frankly, right now. So that's great to see. But what we can also see is that our initiatives around nonconsumables has really helped because our baskets seem to be a little higher with those nonconsumables in them as well. So they're spending at a good rate there, and we believe that she'll continue to do that as we move into the middle part of the year. Matthew Boss : Great. And then maybe just to follow up, John, on the SG&A front. Could you just help quantify what you've embedded in the guidance from a COVID expense perspective, just so we can baseline it? And then ex the strategic investments, is there any change to 2.5% to 3%? I think that's roughly been the underlying comp leverage point in the model. Any change to that? John Garratt : Yes. I'll tackle both of those. First, in terms of the COVID spend, obviously, we're going to do what's necessary to ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers. The guidance captures the best guess of the spending needs associated with that. That's, of course, going to vary based on the severity and duration of the pandemic. But safe to say, we've built in a considerable reduction of that, assuming an improvement of the situation there. And that's what's captured in the guidance. We didn't give a specific number on that, but it is a considerable step down. As you think about SG&A and the 2.5% to 3% leverage point, we've kind of dissuaded people from sticking to that because there is that geography that you noted. One, we are investing in SG&A to drive overall operating margin expansion, particularly gross margin. And so as you look at things like DG Fresh, as we're taking over self-distribution NCI, you spend a little bit on SG&A to save a lot more and drive a lot more benefit on gross margin, so it's very beneficial, overall. But it does throw off the math on that. And then there are some other initiatives like POP SHELF and others that are more -- have more of a start-up cost nature. So it pressures that. And then the other thing we've done is we've really stepped up the remodels, and so that puts a little bit of pressure on the front end of that. So if you strip all those out, that's a lot to strip out, that, as well as the COVID expenses, yes, we're still looking at that 2.5% to 3% leverage point. Nothing has structurally changed. And our -- certainly, our focus on cost containment is sharper than ever. But that's really the only change to that. But for the next few years, as we scale those and we operationalize DG Fresh, you have to put a little bit of labor in the stores, for instance, and a little bit of contract labor to remodel the stores. That's really the big driver of that. But overall, it's accretive from a dollar perspective and a rate perspective. Operator : Our next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So I apologize upfront about another sales-related question. But we do know that the stack comps start to get distorted when we deal with bigger numbers and bigger swings. So if we were to basically dollarize your comps, for lack of a better term, it looks like there really wasn't much of a change in your sales run rate, like from a sales per store perspective between March -- February and March. So 2 questions : first, is that a fair assumption? And then related to that, assuming you maintain a pretty steady -- are you assuming that you're going to maintain a pretty steady sales per store cadence for the balance of the year? Or are you expecting a deceleration in kind of sales per store during the course of the year as we hopefully enter a more normalized environment? John Garratt : Yes. That's a good question. I'll start with the second question. As you look at the guidance we provided this year, we do -- a key element of that is assuming that we retain a considerable portion of the new customers that came in and the bigger baskets that came in. A big piece of that is the initiatives we've put in place, like NCI that position us so well to get a piece of that share of wallet as people came into the brand and like what they saw as well as the coolers that provided a fuller fill in trip when people are looking for groceries. So we've assumed a pretty considerable retention of that. But as we've looked at it throughout the year, we've also said that the share of wallet probably will shift a little bit. Right now, there is, concurrent with the pandemic, there is a consolidation of trips and we're benefiting from that as well as, again, benefiting from that share of wallet. So as you go through the year, we assume you do lose a little bit of that tailwind as you're competing with other segments of the economy for that share of wallet. But still very positive on how much we can retain and, again, the fundamentals of the business and the relevance of the brand as people have come in. And again, as we said, I don't want to dissect February and March too much because again, it was pretty bumpy with the storms in February and a lot of puts and takes in March. And again, you're extrapolating over a pretty short period of time. So when you strip out all the noise, I would tell you that, again, with the guidance we provided, that contemplates what we've seen up to this point. And I think the wildcard is, again, stimulus, and we just didn't put anything in for that because we just don't know what that benefit will be and to what degree. Scot Ciccarelli : But John, just to be clear, like in terms of sales per store, maybe a different way to look at it, did you see much of a change between February and March? John Garratt : No. I would say, as you strip out some of the noise I mentioned, we think the core business is performing similar and performing very well when you look at those stacks. Operator : Our next question is coming from Karen Short of Barclays. Karen Short : I just wanted to get a little bit of color in terms of how we should think about kind of the composition of traffic versus ticket as we go into calendar '21? I mean, obviously, you saw a pretty meaningful, I think, deceleration in traffic in February, but that's off of a pretty high number in February of the prior year. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about that just broadly. And then I wanted to talk a little bit more about '22 as it relates to gross margins. So the question I have on that is, how should we think about the base level of gross margin for '22? Because it seems like you are at a much more permanently elevated base on the gross margin front. And I know '21 is just so hard to talk through because there are so many moving parts, but I wanted to kind of pivot the conversation to '22 on the gross margin front. Todd Vasos : Thanks for the question, Karen. I'll take the first part and then kick it over to John for the '22 gross margin discussion. So on the traffic side, again, February was pretty choppy. You had the storms that, quite frankly, we -- you saw in the release, 8,500 store hours of lost time. But the bigger thing is we -- for a day to almost 2 days, we had anywhere from 20% to 30% of our store base close for that time. So it's a little choppy to be able to talk about traffic in February and then what's happened in March. But I think the way to look at it is we feel really good about that traffic number overall, where we see it. It was very similar to where it had been coming out of Q4. As John said, as you start to pull away some of these puts and takes, I think it's important. We saw a little bit of an uptick in traffic when that stimulus came out, the second round of stimulus. And with only a couple of days to measure, we've seen an uptick in traffic and overall sales with this recent stimulus. But again, I caution, it's still very early to tell what's going to happen here. But I think the bigger picture is we're retaining a lot of those customers, as I mentioned earlier, that we got during the pandemic. And we're still working very hard to keep Dollar General top of mind to those customers, so that when she continues to consider where to shop for her everyday needs and many of these new nonconsumable type items that we've got in our stores, she still comes to us. So we believe we're seeing that repeat customer. And there's no reason why -- we deserve and have the right to keep that customer based on our service of her in the past as well as what we believe we can do in the future for her. John? John Garratt : Yes. And then to the second part of the question, and I agree with you, there's just a lot of noise in 2021. I think one thing I would point to, as you look at over that 2-year period, lots of puts and takes. But when you get to the bottom line, a 2-year CAGR of 15% to 20%, I think, really speaks to the step-change performance in the top line and the flow-through. It makes you feel good about the future. Now I don't want to give specific guidance around 2022. It's premature for that. But as you unpack the drivers of gross margin in Q4 and for the full year, as I mentioned, it's the strategic initiatives which are the core drivers of that. And those still have a lot of tentacles and legs to those that help us going forward. And we're reloading with other initiatives to help drive gross margin. Now the one thing that, we mentioned, [ juiced ] 2020 a little bit was the mix. So that's why we cautioned that we expect the mix to normalize or move back toward consumables somewhat, which is a bit of a drag. But the thing -- the other items driving that gross margin expansion, we expect to continue. And so that's why I mentioned that as we get through the noise of this year and would encourage people to look at that 2-year stack and push forward, the same drivers are there, that makes you feel good about our ability to continue to grow gross margin over the long term, not only the scaling of the existing initiatives in new ones but really pleased what we've seen with the shrink improvement, the supply chain efficiencies, a lot of opportunities still around private brands, penetration expansion for in-sourcing expansion. The team continues to do a great job with category management. Again, when you look at our scale and our growing scale as a limited SKU shop, it really puts us in a very favorable position to get best pricing there and protect our margins while also being well priced. And on the price front, we'll always reserve the right to invest as needed. But as we look at now and as we've seen for quite a while now, we feel like we're in the best position on pricing we've been in and don't see, at least the foreseeable future, the need to invest there. So we feel good about the long-term ability to continue to grow gross margin while also driving traffic and sales. Todd Vasos : Yes. Karen, I would also just say real quick and then get to the next question, is that I feel as good about this business than I have the 12, almost 13 years that I've been here. And the long-term outlook of this business is stronger than ever. And as John indicated, I think once we get through the noise of '21, I believe that algorithm is very much intact. And as you have seen, even prior to COVID, we were running at the top end of that algorithm and many of the components of it. And there's no reason why that shouldn't continue as we can -- as we go long term. Karen Short : No, I complete -- I just want to clarify, on the 8,400 lost days, I get that to be -- it's about 180 basis points to the comp. Is that fair? John Garratt : Well, I think the way to -- yes, I think the way to look at this is, I think we did quantify the impact of the storm on operating profit, and a meaningful piece of that was the sales impact. So if you look at the overall dollars we quantified, about half of that was sales flow-through. So maybe that's the way to dimensionalize that. Operator : Our next question is coming from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I guess, John, first, starting with guidance. I was curious what your team is assuming for the promotional backdrop. And as your trends have turned negative and a number of other players are also starting to turn negative, I was just curious if you have seen any shifts in the promotional backdrop lately. John Garratt : Yes. As you look at the promotional backdrop, we think it remains rational. It's been that way for the last about 1.5 years, so things have been pretty consistent. And so as we look forward, we're not assuming any major changes there because we feel like we're very well positioned on price. And Todd, do you want to add anything? Todd Vasos : Yes, Rupesh, I would tell you, from a position of strength last year, we've positioned ourselves to be in the best position in pricing than we've been in many, many years. And so if you take a look at our everyday pricing, we are better than we've been across all channels of trade. And as John indicated, the promotional environment has been pretty stable and tame, and quite frankly, has been that way for 1.5 years. So we feel pretty good about where we are but always reserve the right if we need to help our consumer out, we'll do that. But right now, we don't see that in the near future. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So Todd, just curious on your latest thoughts on what you're seeing from your consumer base on your service. Because it does appear to us, I mean, it is a fairly strong consumer out there, stimulus is coming. So I just want to get your thoughts there. Todd Vasos : Yes. I would tell you the consumer -- our core consumers always stretch, as you know, but I have to repeat that each time because she really is. And I would tell you that in the last 6 to 8 months, she's felt the stress of this pandemic probably a little bit more than she was feeling in the early part of the pandemic. And in some cases, because again, lack of work or not working that full 40-hour shift to that full-time that she was doing in many cases. And our core consumer is probably a little bit more stretched at this point. In saying that, what we have also seen, though, is her ability to spend when she needs to and stimulus has really helped that. So we're in round 3, and as I indicated, it's very early on in that third round. We're bullish on her ability to have some extra money to spend. And we're also bullish, when we think about the back half of the year, the child tax credit piece that will be coming out for children from July through December should also benefit our core consumer. And then obviously, the extension of the SNAP benefit piece also helps. So there is a lot of tailwind. We just, in our guidance, didn't contemplate any of that because, again, it's so -- first of all, it's so new, we just don't know how to dimensionalize it. But I think the important thing, Rupesh, to keep in mind is that we're well positioned to capture a large portion of that if she's outspending it. And I believe she will spend it. That is who our core consumer is. But as John said, there are other -- we're not as concerned about retail. We believe we will get our -- more than our fair share at retail. It's just some of these other areas that are now open, whether it be dining out, whether it be travel, to some degree, that will be competed against. But we still feel good about being able to service her with that extra money. Operator : Our next question is coming from Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra : I wanted to talk about these new banners that you spoke of today. And especially with POP SHELF, you mentioned doing a store-within-a-store concept with signage for both POP SHELF and the Dollar General banner outside. As you think about your core customer, what gives you confidence that the customers will not feel an alienation to the core banner with this double signage outside in a store-within-a-store concept? How do you think about that? Todd Vasos : Yes, that's a great question. And I would tell you, first of all, our core consumer is a little bit of a different consumer than the POP SHELF consumer. But in the areas that we're looking to put these store-within-the-store concepts, it is a little higher demographic than our core. So just to give you some color, in these areas, the demographics are more in the $50,000 to $75,000 income range versus our true Dollar General of $35,000 to $40,000 range, somewhere in there. So it's not quite the POP SHELF, where it's $75,000-plus. But I believe that the crossover, there's enough there to entice the consumer to come in. The second piece of it is that we believe that -- and we've already proven it with some cross-pollination of items within Dollar General that were in POP SHELF and how well they sold within the box of just a true Dollar General without even having any signage up with POP SHELF. So we know those same items will resonate with even our core consumers. So we believe we can capture both sides of that equation, higher end as well as continue to service the lower-end consumer with this new box. It is a test, right? So just keep that in mind. It will be 25 stores this year. But if it works, and we believe it will, there could be some additional ones that we do in '22 and many more as we continue to move forward. Chandni Luthra : Got it. And my follow-up is around new customer retention strategy that you mentioned during your third quarter call around -- some strategy around basically retaining those new customers. Could you give an update on that as to what you're doing to retain new customers that you gained during this time? Todd Vasos : Yes. Thank you. Well, we started that retention effort back in September. We thought it was the right time to start launching it because we knew, because of the way we were doing it, this wasn't a pricing item retention strategy. This was a retention strategy to keep Dollar General top of mind with these newer customers. And when the pandemic starts to wane, we would keep -- Dollar General would still be in the consideration set. So to be able to do that, it takes months to be able to instill that piece into the customer's mindset. And so we've been working it hard, now for the better part of 5 months, coming on 6 months. And we believe that we've seen the benefit of that already. When we saw the benefits of stimulus start to wane in November and even early December before the second wave came out, we were still seeing that repeat customer come into the store. So that gave us confidence that what we were doing was working. And now even into Q1, as I mentioned earlier, we're still seeing that core customer -- or I'm sorry, that new customer show up within our stores. Even though the pandemic is starting to wane even a little bit more, we're still seeing that customer. We will not leave the foot off the accelerator here. We believe that we'll continue to do everything we can to drive that consumer in. And as John indicated, a large part of that comp this year is predicated on retaining a good portion of those consumers, which, again, we believe we have the right to service that consumer based on what we've seen so far. Operator : We're showing time for one final question today. Our last question will be coming from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : You've shared a lot today. I guess maybe I'd be looking for just additional details on where you are on some of your initiatives and what we should be thinking about over the course of the next 12 months. Specifically DG Fresh, would love for you to elaborate there in addition to DG GO! and other ways that you are just overall kind of attacking to keep market share. Jeffery Owen : Paul, this is Jeff. Thank you for that question, and we are very proud of our accomplishments with DG Fresh. The team has done a fantastic job of accelerating that rollout and the capabilities that it's providing for us. So to be in 16,000 stores-plus is really an accomplishment. And originally, as we talked about, DG Fresh was all about reducing product costs, improving in-stocks and a broader assortment and we've hit on all 3. So that is performing very well. The other thing that we're excited about is the future and what it can potentially provide for us as we continue to grow. When you think back for a second on the formats that we've also introduced, the reason we're able to build larger stores with more coolers is really dependent on our strategic planning process that started several years ago, and DG Fresh is a certain core to all of that. And so when you think about the future and our new format prototype that we're going to be moving to in the mid part of '21, DG Fresh is going to play a key role in being able to continue to broaden that assortment for the customer. And then as you look to the future, we also believe that DG Fresh plays a key role in unlocking our ability to do produce in over 10,000 stores as we look ahead. So DG Fresh, again, complicated initiative that the team did a phenomenal job of implementing but is going to set us up for the future in a big way. On the digital side, I would say, remember, on DG Pickup, 17,000 stores-plus going from pilot to full rollout in less than a year is, again, a tremendous accomplishment of the team. But I will say we continue to make great progress there and expanding the assortment. We've optimized our substitution technology. And one thing you got to keep in mind is we're providing optionality for this customer. But our store itself is an incredibly convenient proposition. And when you combine being 5 miles within 75% of the population and self-checkout that we've got in 1,600 stores right now, the convenience bar continues to rise. But we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far there. And then finally, I would tell you, in terms of engagement with the customer, that's the other thing on the digital side she's asking for. And with 4 million active users and growing, we feel real good about what we're doing there as well. So 2 key initiatives that we look to continue to contribute to our future success. Paul Trussell : Just lastly, John, I appreciate the CapEx and kind of share buyback guidance. Maybe just talk about your approach to cash kind of priorities overall and how to think about that even beyond 2021. John Garratt : Yes. I'll start by saying our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. And the first priority remains investing in high-return growth opportunities like new store growth, remodels and the strategic initiatives that just provide fantastic returns. Then it's still continuing to pay a competitive dividend, which we recently increased 16.7%. And then it's buying back shares with the excess cash and debt capacity. But as we've always noted, we want to protect our current investment-grade credit rating, so we keep the leverage ratio around 3. So we bought back this year. I mean, we're able to do all and buy back $2.5 billion of shares with the extra cash. Next year, we're targeting $1.8 billion. And then I think also, meaningfully, what you saw last year is we accelerated virtually every strategic initiative with the extra cash, which is again our first priority, investing in the business. So that served us very well and remains unchanged. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. Thank you for your interest in Dollar General. You may disconnect your lines and log off the webcast, and have a wonderful day.",

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our strong start to fiscal 2021, and I want to thank our associates for their unwavering commitment to supporting our customers, communities and each other. As a testament to their efforts, our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, reflecting strong underlying performance across the business, which we believe was enhanced by the most recent round of government stimulus payments.  The quarter was highlighted by net sales growth of 16% in our combined nonconsumable categories, a 208 basis point increase in gross margin rate and double-digit growth in diluted EPS. Despite what continues to be a challenging operating environment, we are increasing our sales and diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2021 to reflect our strong first quarter performance. John will provide additional details on our outlook during his remarks.  As always, the health and safety of our employees and customers continue to be a top priority while meeting the critical needs of the communities we serve. And we believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, including our network of more than 17,000 stores located within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. Overall, we are executing well against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth. Now let's recap some of the top line results for the first quarter. As we lapped our most difficult quarterly comp sales comparison of the year, net sales decreased 0.6% to $8.4 billion, driven by a comp sales decline of 4.6%. Notably, comp sales on a 2-year stack basis increased a robust 17.1%, which compares to the 15.9% 2-year stack we delivered last quarter. Our first quarter sales results include a decline in customer traffic, which was partially offset by growth in average basket size. And while customers continue to consolidate trips, on average, they continue to spend more with us compared to last year. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales increased 5.7% in February despite a headwind from inclement weather across the country. For the month of March, which represents our most difficult monthly sales comparison of the year, comp sales declined 11.2%. Importantly, beginning in mid-March and in line with the timing of stimulus payments, we saw a meaningful acceleration in sales relative to the first 2 weeks of the month, especially in our nonconsumable categories. Comp sales declined 4.3% in April. And while year-over-year growth in nonconsumable sales moderated in comparison to March, they were positive overall despite a more challenging lap. Overall, each of our 3 nonconsumable categories delivered a comp sales increase for the quarter. Of note, comp sales growth of 11.3% in our combined nonconsumable categories and 29.8% on a comparable 2-year stack basis significantly exceeded our expectation and speaks to the continued strength and sustained momentum in these product categories, enhanced by the benefit from stimulus. Once again this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data.  Importantly, we continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers acquired over the past several quarters and are working hard to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives. In addition, we recently published our third annual Serving Others report, which provides context related to our ongoing ESG efforts as well as new and updated performance metrics, and we look forward to continued progress on our journey as we move ahead. Collectively, our first quarter results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and believe we are well positioned to continue advancing our goal of further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.  As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock even more growth opportunities as we move forward. In short, I feel very good about the underlying business, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.  As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which we believe was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant benefit to sales, particularly in our nonconsumables categories from the most recent round of government stimulus payments.  Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.8% in the first quarter. As Todd noted, this was an increase of 208 basis points and represents our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to : higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, a greater proportion of sales coming from our nonconsumables categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by increased transportation costs, which were primarily driven by higher rates.  SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22%, an increase of 152 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of net sales, the most significant of which were store occupancy costs, disaster expenses related to Winter Storm Uri, retail labor and depreciation and amortization. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the first quarter increased 4.9% to $908.9 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 10.8%, an increase of 56 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% and compares to 22.2% in the first quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the first quarter increased 10.2% to $2.82, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 38% over a 2-year period. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $5.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 24.2% overall and a 17.6% increase on a per store basis as we cycled a 5.5% decline in inventory on a per store basis, driven by extremely strong sales volumes in Q1 2020.  In anticipation of a more challenging supply environment, we strategically pulled forward certain inventory purchases during the quarter, particularly in select nonconsumable categories to better support the sales momentum we were seeing in the business. And while out of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with the overall quality of our inventory.  The business generated significant cash flow from operations during the quarter totaling $703 million, a decrease of 60% but which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 11% over a 2-year period. This decrease was primarily driven by higher levels of inventory as a result of improving inventory positions, including the pull forward of certain inventory purchases I mentioned earlier.  Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $278 million and included : our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations; distribution and transportation projects; and spending related to our strategic initiatives.  During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares of our common stock for $1 billion and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $100 million. At the end of Q1, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.7 billion.  Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA.  Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. Despite continued uncertainty, as Todd mentioned, we are increasing our full year guidance for sales and EPS due to our strong Q1 outperformance, which we believe was aided by the latest round of stimulus. For 2021, we now expect the following : net sales in the range of a 1% decline to an increase of 1%; a same-store sales decline of 5% to 3% but which reflects growth of approximately 11% to 13% on a 2-year stack basis; and EPS in the range of $9.50 to $10.20, which reflects a compound annual growth rate in the range of approximately 20% to 24% or in the range of approximately 19% to 23% compared to the 2019 adjusted diluted EPS over a 2-year period, which is well above our long-term goal of delivering at least 10% annual EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Our EPS guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%.  With regards to share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase approximately $2.2 billion of our common stock this year compared to our previous expectation of about $1.8 billion. Finally, our 2021 outlook for capital spending and real estate projects remains unchanged from what we stated in our Q4 2020 earnings release on March 18, 2021.  Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our full year outlook. First, there could be additional headwinds and tailwinds this year, the timing, degree and potential impacts on our business of which are currently unclear, including but not limited to the potential impacts from legislation and regulatory agency actions. Given the unusual situation, I will now elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in May.  From the end of Q1 through May 23, comp sales declined by approximately 7% as we continue to cycle extremely difficult prior year comparisons. As a reminder, comp sales growth for the month of May in 2020 was 21.5%. And while we are nonetheless encouraged with our sales trends, we remain cautious in our 2021 sales outlook, given the continued uncertainty that still exists, the unique comparisons against last year and the anticipation of fading tailwinds from the most recent round of government stimulus. That said, as you think about the comp sales cadence of 2021, we continue to expect our performance to be better in the second half, given a more difficult comp sales comparison in the first half.  Turning to gross margin. As a reminder, gross margin in 2020 benefited from a favorable sales mix and a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rates in more clear and sensitive nonconsumables categories. As we move through 2021, we expect pressure in our gross margin rate as we anticipate a less favorable sales mix, an increase in markdown rates as we cycle abnormally low levels we saw in 2020 and higher fuel and transportation costs. Also, please keep in mind, the second and third quarters represent our most challenging laps of the year from a gross margin rate perspective, following improvements of 167 basis points in Q2 2020 and 178 basis points in Q3 2020. With regards to SG&A, while we continue to expect ongoing expenses related to the pandemic in 2021, overall, we currently anticipate a significant reduction in COVID-19-related costs compared to the prior year. Additionally, we continue to expect about $60 million to $70 million incremental year-over-year investments in our strategic initiatives this year as we further their rollouts. This amount includes approximately $23 million in incremental investments made during the first quarter. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect our strategic initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense.  In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and performance, which resulted in another quarter of exceptional results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.  With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We are off to a great start to the year as our team continues to drive strong execution across our portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me take you through some of the more recent highlights. Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in over 7,300 stores at the end of Q1, and we remain on track to expand this offering to a total of more than 11,000 stores by year-end, including over 2,100 stores in our light version, which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment but through a more streamlined approach.  We're especially pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we continue to see across our NCI product categories. Notably, this performance is contributing to an incremental comp sales increase in nonconsumable sales of 8% in our NCI stores and 3% in our NCI light stores as compared to stores without the NCI offering. Given our strong performance to date, coupled with the added flexibility of a more streamlined approach, our plans now include completing the rollout of NCI across nearly all of the chain by year-end 2022.  Moving to our newest concept, pOpshelf, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 3 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 8. And while still early, we continue to be very pleased with the initial results, which have far exceeded our expectations for both sales and gross margin.  In fact, year 1 annualized sales volumes for our first 8 locations are trending between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, with an average gross margin rate of about 40% which we expect will climb as we continue to scale this exciting initiative. As a reminder, this compares to year 1 sales volumes of about $1.4 million for a traditional Dollar General store and a gross margin rate of about 32% for the overall chain in 2020. For 2021, we remain on track to have a total of up to 50 pOpshelf locations by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop into one of our larger-format Dollar General market stores. Importantly, we currently estimate there are about 3,000 pOpshelf store opportunities potentially available in the Continental United States. And when combined with pOpshelf's compelling unit economics, we remain very excited about the significant and incremental growth opportunities we see available for this unique and differentiated concept.  Turning now to DG Fresh, which is the strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated products. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs on these items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. In fact, DC Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases. And we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to optimize our network and further leverage our scale.  Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories, and we are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the continued rollout of additional products, including both national and private brands. In total, at the end of Q1, we were delivering to more than 17,000 stores from 10 facilities and now expect to complete our initial rollout across the chain by the end of Q2, which is ahead of our previous expectation of year-end as communicated on our Q4 call.  Moving to our cooler expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During the quarter, we added nearly 18,000 cooler doors across our store base and are on track to install approximately 65,000 cooler doors this year. Notably, the majority of these doors will be in high-capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection, all enabled by DG Fresh.  In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI and DG Fresh, we continue to pursue other gross margin enhancing opportunities, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink.  Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. In the first quarter, we completed a total of 836 real estate projects, including 260 new stores, 543 remodels and 33 relocations. In addition, we now have produce in more than 1,300 stores.  For 2021, we remain on track to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores, representing 2,900 real estate projects in total. We also now plan to add produce in more than 1,000 stores, which compares to our previous expectation of approximately 700 stores. As a reminder, we recently made key changes to our development strategy, including establishing 2 of our larger footprint formats, which each comprise about 8,500 square feet of selling space as our base prototypes for nearly all new stores going forward. With about 1,200 square feet of additional selling space compared to a traditional store, these larger formats allow for expanded high-capacity cooler counts, an extended queue line and a broader product assortment, including NCI, a larger health and beauty section with about 30% more feet of selling space and produce in select stores.  We are especially pleased with the sales productivity of these larger formats as average sales per square foot are currently trending about 15% above an average traditional store, which bodes well for the future as we look to grow these unit counts in the years ahead. In total, we expect more than 550 of our real estate projects this year will be in these formats as we look to further enhance our value and convenience proposition while driving additional growth.  Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our brick-and-mortar footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. One such example is contactless payment, which is now available in the vast majority of the chain, further extending our convenience proposition, particularly for those seeking a more contactless shopping experience. Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. Going forward, our plans include providing more relevant, meaningful and personalized offerings, with the goal of driving even higher levels of digital engagement and customer loyalty.  Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach where our goals include : increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a result of our efforts, both around rolltainer and case pack optimization, which have led to even more efficient stocking of our stores.  The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 3,400 stores at the end of Q1, which represents more than double the store count at the end of Q4. And we are pleased with our results, including customer adoption rates as well as positive feedback both from customers and employees.  Our plans consist of a broader rollout this year, and we are focused on introducing this offering into the vast majority of our stores by the end of 2022 as we look to further enhance our convenience proposition while extending our position as an innovative leader in small-box discount retail. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for career advancement. In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes, and we continue to pursue innovative opportunities to further develop our teams, including our recent announcement to partner with a leading training provider to deliver more personalized training solutions to our employees. Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our organization and are an important driver of our consistent and strong execution.  At the store level, we continue to be pleased with our robust internal promotion pipeline and store manager turnover, which continues to trend below historic levels. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.  Overall, we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, and we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating meaningful value for our shareholders. In closing, I am proud of our team's performance, and we are pleased with our strong first quarter results, which further demonstrate that our unique combination of value and convenience continues to resonate with customers and positions us well going forward. I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our approximately 157,000 employees across the company for their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.  With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : My first question is on the business, a look maybe 1 year later or 1 year after this COVID started. Can you talk about the traffic? I know the rural store bases across retail seem to do well. Can you talk about how you're doing on the lap? And then anything changing in the basket that you're seeing, whether you're doing well and still in the consumables or how the basket may be evolving? Todd Vasos : Yes. Simeon, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're very happy with what we're seeing [indiscernible] now a year out of the pandemic or again, lapping the pandemic, maybe a better term. When you look at it, what we've seen is those customers that we were able to bring in during the COVID crisis or the heat of it, we have retained a very large portion, better than what we had anticipated doing. As you may recall, we launched a very aggressive, back in that August-September time frame, an aggressive campaign to not only retain but keep her engaged at Dollar General. And that seems to be working very, very nicely.  But as we've indicated in the past, when we see that our core consumer has more money to spend and stimulus has given her some of that tailwind, if you will, what she tends to do is contract on the number of visits but spends a lot more, and that's exactly what we saw. We saw our basket size increase very nicely with our core consumer as well as with these trade-in consumers that we saw during the heat of the battle of COVID that we've been able to retain. So it really sets us up nicely as we continue to move through this year. We feel very good about what we're seeing. And we're staying squarely focused on what we can control here and that's driving profitable sales growth. Simeon Gutman : And the 2-year stack, I think if I did the math right, or if I heard the numbers right, I think it's running now 14 in May, if that's right. What are the puts and takes to that? I think there's a little more stimulus coming. Do you think this could be the run rate that you can hold going forward? John Garratt : Yes. In terms of -- you're right in terms of the stack in terms of the cadence. If you look at the cadence of the quarter, it picked up nicely with the onset of the stimulus, where we're very well positioned to get more than our fair share of that. You did see sequentially on a 2-year stack basis, it moderates somewhat but remain very strong and very strong across the board when you look at 2-year stacks, both on the nonconsumables as well as the consumables but particularly when you look at the nonconsumables, just a fantastic 2-year stack as we shared.  And I think that really speaks to the strength of what we've done with the initiatives on both the consumable side of the business to provide that fuller fill-in trip grocery shop as well as on the nonconsumable side to get a fair share of these folks coming in as we take share from specialty retail. As we look ahead, the laps get actually easier in the back half of the year from a comp standpoint but we just feel fantastic about the fundamentals of the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on the performance. So Todd, maybe just take a step back. Could you speak to new customer acquisition that you're seeing in market share that you see driving the performance continuing? And maybe on that taking a step back, how would you compare what you're seeing today to maybe the time at which we were exiting the financial crisis as we think about customer acquisition, new households shopping Dollar General? And then if you were to rank, where do you see market share opportunities by category from here? Todd Vasos : Yes, Matt, I'll try to weave all that in. But I would tell you that we're very happy with what we see on that customer acquisition side. Let me try to go to one part of your question, that is financial crisis coming out of that compared to what we are seeing now on the back side of COVID. Very similar from the standpoint that, that consumer is still very engaged. I think the biggest difference here is the amount of stimulus that is in the system right now.  So our core shopper continues to be -- have a lot more money than she normally would, and she's spending a great deal of that with us, which is great to see. And I think the other side of the equation is that, that trade-in shopper is financially doing pretty well as the economy opens back up. As we can see, it's opening up in a very robust manner. And I think the difference of '08 and now is that, that consumer has more money to spend. And the great thing is she continues to come back to Dollar General, that higher-income shopper and shop with us. And that's exactly what we saw in '08 but in a way, she didn't have a lot of money. This time, she does have money but still continues to shop.  So I think that just speaks to the relevancy that we've built in this box since that '08 crisis. This box, as you know, has transformed tremendously since then. So we feel good about those trends and our core shopper trends.  As it relates to market share, we're seeing gains across the board. Drug continues to be our #1 donor share. Grocery is donating as well as, I think, consumers start to go back to some normal shopping patterns as it relates to food at home. And we're seeing those come back to Dollar General in a nice way. And then even in our own space, we're taking share, which is great to see.  So it's really across the board. And I think it's a real testament to the initiatives that we put in place years ago. This isn't a -- just because of COVID, this underlying business, as I've said before, is as strong as I've ever seen it. Matthew Boss : Todd, maybe as a follow-up to that, what inning would you characterize those key initiatives? If we think about DG Fresh, NCI, private label, I think you have a laundry list that you've walked through. But what inning would you characterize overall these initiatives as we think going forward? Todd Vasos : Yes, you heard Jeff's prepared remarks. But if I step back and take a look at NCI as an example, we'll be completely rolled out by the end of '22. So I would tell you, we're probably halfway through the game as we go through this year and then into next, which feels really good.  In our cooler initiative and DG Fresh just in general, I would tell you that we're in the -- we're still in the fourth inning, maybe closer to the bottom of the fourth inning but still in the fourth inning. We've got a lot of runway ahead of us there. And that's been the largest contributor on our initiative side that we've seen both on the top line and bottom line. And the great thing is that we've got a lot of runway yet to go there. pOpshelf, I mean we're just coming up to bat. We're really happy with what we're seeing there. And we supplied a little more color. Hopefully, it was helpful on what we're seeing early on in our sales and margin coming out of there. And we're very, very encouraged there. And I would tell you, as you know Dollar General pretty well, as we start to see more evidence that this is a very good initiative, we can go very quickly. So stay tuned on that.  And our digital side, this will be an ongoing initiative. But I would tell you, we're in the infancy stages, very early innings on our initiatives there in and around digital. So a tremendous amount of opportunity, both top line and bottom line because these initiatives are aimed at both. And that's the -- I think that's the important aspect here is that we're controlling every line of that P&L. Matthew Boss : Great. It sounds like a lot of balls still to play. Best of luck. Todd Vasos : Absolutely. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : I wanted to see if you could give a little color in terms of the May sales trends with respect to discretionary versus consumables. And I do have a question related to how you answer that from a bigger picture perspective. John Garratt : Yes. So if you look at May, we gave the May -- through the 23rd, comp sales were down 7%, but obviously, as we mentioned, a pretty strong 2-year stack in the 14th. There was a question also in terms of did that month-to-date differ from the full month, and it didn't change much at all. So strong performance continued and we saw continued strength in our nonconsumables, but also the consumables when you look at a 2-year stack, so very strong performance from both sides of the box. Karen Short : Okay. So just bigger picture, when I look at your mix in discretionary, you're up almost 200 basis points -- well, 200 basis points since 2018 in terms of mix shift in discretionary. So -- and I guess, when you look at your overall gross margins, it seems -- and you've talked to the fact that there is significant opportunity on the gross margin front. So I guess what I'm wondering is looking maybe a year or 2 out, what do you think the discretionary mix could be within your sales? And then how should we think about gross margins as we look into 2022? I mean, I realize '21 has some very tough compares than 2022. John Garratt : Karen, I think as you look at the nonconsumables business, obviously, there's some tailwind that you got from -- during the pandemic and from the stimulus. But I would just point to the ongoing strength that we've shown there. We've delivered comp growth in nonconsumables for 12 consecutive quarters, and I think that just really speaks to the relevance we've put into that piece of the box. And as you continue to see the share we're taking, how we're outperforming others. We have noted that the lap does get tougher as we get into Q2. You're lapping sales growth in the nonconsumables category of 40.8% last year. So that's a tough lap, puts pressure on that. But I would tell you, we feel great about the nonconsumables business as we look forward and as we continue to scale that, almost doubling that this year and then taking the best of the best from that, importing that across the chain and then taking the learnings from that and putting that into pOpshelf and then cross-pollinating the best ideas between the 2. We feel fantastic about that business. Karen Short : And any thoughts on how -- what would be a normalized -- or not normalized, but how that -- how we should think about gross margins going into 2022? John Garratt : Yes. Obviously, we're not giving '22 guidance just yet. But what I'd tell you is this, is you look at the performance in gross margin. We've delivered 8 consecutive quarters of gross margin growth, up 208 basis points this quarter, lapping 49 basis points this quarter last year. And when you look at the drivers of that, again, there was some tailwind from nonconsumables from the stimulus. But when you look at the drivers, it's the strategic initiatives driving that. The top 3, we've been talking about these top 3 for several quarters now. It's higher initial markups, that's DG Fresh driving that. And that is a gift that keeps on giving as we scale that, complete that across the chain and then drive efficiency than that.  The next 2 we talked about were lower markdowns and the mix benefit. And again, you got some extra tailwind from the stimulus, but it's nonconsumables driving that and that's been a consistent driver for some time now. And then you look at shrink, shrink was another benefit. Now as you look at the near term, as I mentioned, we hit a very difficult lap around nonconsumables, which will pressure that year-over-year mix even though we feel great about the nonconsumables.  And then as others have talked about it, we do see pressures this year associated with transportation costs, but we do believe that's more of a near-term pressure, not something structural that will last forever. And so as we push through those 2 pressure points, we feel good about what we've been doing in terms of driving gross margin and operating margin expansion and our ability to keep doing so, not only with these strategic initiatives I mentioned but then all the other drivers we talk about, not just shrink but private brand penetration, foreign sourcing penetration, supply chain efficiencies we continue to drive to mitigate the pressures that others are seeing and so it's not as impactful to us. And then we always talk about our buying power. And then last but not least, we will invest in price if needed, if warranted. But I can tell you, we feel like we're in a great pricing position right now and don't see the need to. So we feel good about our ability to drive it higher over time, both gross margin and operating margin overall. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Nice quarter. Maybe the first one turns out to be a little bit of a follow-up now. But as it relates to product cost inflation, can you just talk about what you are seeing and what you're expecting from product cost inflation standpoint, especially in consumables? And then what are your expectations for pass-through? And to what extent are you in the driver seat? To what extent do you kind of need to follow what Walmart does? Are you seeing anything out there to suggest that you wouldn't be able to pass through higher product cost inflation if that happens? Jeffery Owen : Ed, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. Certainly, on the product cost, on the first part of that question, what I would tell you is that our merchants have done a fantastic job of partnering with our suppliers. And this is where the model at Dollar General really performs well in the sense that our scale and our limited SKU assortment allows us the opportunity to really find innovative ways to protect that underserved customer and certainly find ways that we can mitigate the cost pressures. But certainly, as many retailers have talked about, we have seen that.  But again, real pleased with our pricing position. We feel really good about where we are. We talked about this before. We've made some strategic decisions last year to get in some of the best pricing position we've been. And so feel good about where we are. We'll continue to fight for that customer every day. As you know, here at Dollar General, price and value are so important to her and we're here to serve her. So I'm really pleased with where they are. We'll continue to monitor that but feel good about the team's performance to date on that front. Edward Kelly : Okay. And then just one on labor cost here. Can you just provide some color on what you're seeing out there? I mean, obviously, a lot of companies have talked about challenges. You grow a lot, so you're adding a lot of employees. Has it caused you to rethink wage levels at all? Do you see this as transitory? Just how do we think about the pressure there and how that's changing? Jeffery Owen : Ed, we have seen some pressure as many retailers have said. But you know what, I'm so proud of what our team has done to respond. And certainly, in April, we announced our national hiring event with a goal to hire up to 20,000 additional employees. And I'm very pleased that already we have beaten that goal by 50%. So I think it points to the thing we've said all along, and that is Dollar General is such an amazing place to start a career. And so again, we feel real good about the opportunity we can provide with over 12,000 store managers internally promoted. We've got a robust internal pipeline. We still be -- we're still able to attract, so we feel real good there. And certainly, as we have always talked here at Dollar General, we're surgical in the way that we respond to different challenges. So the comments you've mentioned, we're not seeing it widespread. There are pockets, and so we'll certainly tailor our solution to where it makes sense.  We always pay competitive wages. We have and we will continue to. And still very pleased at our turnover rates that point to this opportunity here at Dollar General to attract folks, provide a great growth opportunity. And so right now, we are certainly making progress mitigating these challenges, and I'm really pleased with the progress I'm seeing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Your 2-year compound annual growth for consumables grew 12% in the fourth quarter -- 12% in the third and fourth quarter last year. You grew [ 11% ] in the first quarter [indiscernible] only by 100 basis points. How much of that slowdown would you attribute to consumers going back out to eat and so they don't need to visit Dollar General as often for those [ same ] interests? Or how much is it your expectation that some of that is due to consumers got a $1,400 check at least. And so they might be going to Walmart or Target or some other discretionary retailer and rolling up on a big-ticket item, and while they're there, purchasing other goods that's taking away a trip from Dollar General? Todd Vasos : Yes. It was very difficult, Michael, to understand you and the question. But if I got some of the sense of it, yes, we feel good about our consumable and nonconsumable businesses where they're at. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to take share from all different classes of trade out there. So I feel better than I ever have on being able to continue to drive the top line on both our consumables and nonconsumables side of the business. And if I missed that question or if you like to ask it again, I'm happy to answer it. Michael Lasser : The question is your 2-year compound annual growth rate for your consumables business slowed modestly from 4Q to 1Q. How much do you attribute that to the people going back out to eat so they don't need to fill in [indiscernible]? Or they got a $1,400 check, so now they're going to Walmart to buy a TV and while they're there, they're filling up their basket, which may also be taking away a fill-in trip from DG. Todd Vasos : Yes. I apologize, Michael. Thank you for repeating that. Yes, I would tell you, it's definitely not the latter that we've seen. It's probably more -- the little slowdown that we have seen there was one, such a robust last year and even into the fourth quarter. The economy is opening up a little bit. So that consumer has the ability to go do some other things.  And food away from home, I'm sure, like yourself, a lot of people wanted to get out and get out of the house, so I think that definitely played into Q1. What we're already seeing though in early Q2 is that some of that food at home is being -- it looks like it's pretty sticky. And while I'm not ready to talk about Q2 right now, I can tell you that especially in those areas like DG Fresh, our perishable areas, we're seeing very, very nice sales, robust sales in there. So it really shows that, that consumer still has a propensity to have food at home.  And I would tell you, just like anything, when things last more than a quarter or 2 or half a year, they become pretty ingrained. And I think food at home has become pretty ingrained. Now that doesn't mean that they won't go out to eat, but I think they're going to be doing more food at home than they had prior to the pandemic. And we're already seeing that, as I mentioned, start to materialize here in Q2. Michael Lasser : Got it. On the gross margin, 200-plus basis points, John. You did provide the order of magnitude. But could you put a quantification around how much of the gross margin was due to factors that have been driven by your initiatives like DG Fresh, NCI, which should continue? Is it 100 basis points over the next couple of quarters versus other factors that might be temporary such as mix or lack of promotions within the environment? And are you already starting to see more promotions come back such that, that could be a risk factor to offset those factors that you have within your control over the next few quarters? John Garratt : Yes, Michael. So as you look -- as you pointed out, those are in the order of importance and the #1 called out, and it was a good bit higher than the other 2, although all were quite impactful, was higher initial markups, and that was DG Fresh. And that is something I would say continues and actually improves as we scale that across the system and get the efficiencies.  As you get to the next 2, the lower markdowns, certainly a big piece of that was the higher sell-through on the nonconsumables. But if you recall, we were calling out lower markdowns even before that as we got tighter and tighter around promotional activity, and we've stayed tight on promotional activity. While I would say compared to last year, it's up a little bit because last year there was virtually no promotional activity. If you compare to 2019, it's down. So we're not seeing that much more promotional activity. We're actually seeing a little bit less. If you go back to 2019, there just was none last year. And so things remain pretty tame that way.  And then on the mix benefit, again, certainly got some extra juice from the stimulus. But again, 12 consecutive quarters of nonconsumable comp growth. And when we're virtually doubling that initiative and putting the best of the best across the chain, we think that continues to help us. And again, shrink, that was a benefit not related to the current environment. So it's certainly a mix. It's hard to when you look at nonconsumables to untangle what was stimulus and what was just what we did to make that piece of the box more relevant. I'd say we set ourselves up very well in that regard. And then again, I would like to think that the higher carry rates is more -- is not something structural. It's more of a supply and demand imbalance that should sort itself out later. One of the things I'll mention that is a wildcard that's not in our guidance, and that is what impact the child tax credits will have. And so while there's -- we've not assumed any more stimulus, we've not assumed any more child tax credits, just given the number of potential macro puts and takes, including the child tax credits, but then conversely, what happens when the -- some of the enhanced benefits are removed. So that's another wildcard in the back portion of the year.  But as you look at the gross margin, I would tell you, a big chunk of this is structural as evidenced by the strong fundamentals driving it and the track record we've delivered. But as we mentioned, there's just some near-term pressures over the next few quarters. Michael Lasser : That's very helpful. Could I just clarify what you -- one point you made that you're not -- you're seeing promotions better today than they were in 2019? So you're not seeing conventional grocery stores promote more because their sales are under -- on decline as consumers go out to eat more? Todd Vasos : Yes. We watch this very closely, Michael. And I would tell you, John hit it right on the head, and that is we're seeing a little bit more promotional activity than we did last year because it was absolutely none last year. But it is substantially, substantially lower than it was in 2019. And so I would tell you that, that tame promotional environment that we've been talking about even prior to the pandemic and through the pandemic still persists. We have not seen that whatsoever. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer & Co. Rupesh Parikh : So my first question is with the comp guide. I was curious how you guys are thinking about traffic for the balance of the year. John Garratt : Yes. I think the way you think about traffic, we've been talking about this, there's been quite a bit of trip consolidation. So people have been coming in a little less frequently. They've been putting a lot more in their basket. Now what I would tell you is we looked across recent periods, we've seen the traffic start to pick up. And so what we would expect as the mobility picks up, the traffic will pick up. The baskets will come down somewhat, but our goal is to hold as much of that bigger basket that we gained.  It's pretty impressive when you look at the 2-year stacks on the growing basket on top of basket growth last year, again, as we provide -- position ourselves to that fuller fill-in trip. But what we would expect is that traffic to continue to pick up as people get out more. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-up on pOpshelf. So clearly, very upbeat commentary in terms of what you guys are seeing so far. So I guess, Todd, what has surprised you so far with the concept? Todd Vasos : I'm sorry, what was the question? Rupesh Parikh : Yes, on pOpshelf, you guys have seen very strong results so far. So I was just curious what has surprised you so far with the performance there? Todd Vasos : Oh, surprise. Yes. I would tell you that we're very happy with what we're seeing. I believe that the biggest surprise probably was when you launch a brand from ground zero, you don't normally see the amount of traction and sustained traction that we are seeing and repeat customers that we're seeing.  The other thing that's really a surprise is the customer feedback that we're getting. We're getting promoter scores in the upper 80s and 90% range, which is unheard of. And so that's what gives us great optimist, if you will -- optimistic that we will continue to be able to grow this piece. Stay tuned.  And as I mentioned earlier, because of what we're seeing not only on the sales line, but I think the other nice surprise was on that margin side at 40% margins. And I would tell you, the upside to that is great, very great, quite frankly, as we scale this. So we think that between those 2, and you know us well, we'll move fast in store openings once we get another few weeks behind our belt here. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Scott Mushkin : Seeing that pOpshelf, it's just an insane format, one of the best I've seen in about 20 years, so I look forward to hearing more about it. But my actual question is on DGX, you guys didn't mention it. Maybe not as much sizzle as the pOpshelf but seems like it almost could supplant the normal convenience stores. It's about 10,000 7-Elevens. And I look at that store and say, \"Gosh, like, why would I ever go to a 7-Eleven if there was a DGX in the neighborhood?\" Jeffery Owen : Scott, thank you for the question. And we are real excited about DGX. And certainly, as we talked before, during the pandemic, as you remember, DGX is situated to locate where you work and play. And certainly during the pandemic, we saw some pullback, obviously, with so much remote and work at home. But we feel real good about what we're seeing now. We've talked earlier about how we're seeing the economy kind of open up and folks get out more and we're seeing that come back nicely in our DGX stores. And so you're right. We're very excited. You'll recall last conference call, we talked about the opportunity for 1,000 possible DGX locations across the country. And then you know us well. If we find a concept that can work even better and increase that over time, we'll certainly try to do that. But right now, the offering inside the DGX, we also have very high customer satisfaction scores like the pOpshelf brand as well. We are real pleased with what the customer is saying and we're also pleased with the opportunity. So stay tuned, but that just gives us yet another leg of growth.  So you got pOpshelf where we've talked about incremental 3,000 opportunities; DGX, an incremental 1,000 opportunities; and then our traditional fleet where we believe there's 13,000 additional opportunities. So 17,000 opportunities in total gives us great confidence that we can continue to grow this great brand across the country. So we're really excited about what the future holds there. Scott Mushkin : And if I could have a follow-up -- I guess I get a follow-up. On the pricing side, kind of taking that and turning it on its ear a little bit. I mean if you look at what's going on in your business, you obviously talked about gross margin expansion possibilities as well as labor efficiency possibilities and, of course, the limited SKUs you guys offer. Why wouldn't I think that you can use -- and we've seen this, our pricing surveys kind of coming -- the gap coming down with Walmart. Why wouldn't we see that continuing? Like you have a lot of levers to pull. Todd Vasos : Yes. We watch it very closely. You know us pretty well. And pricing is one of my pet projects here at Dollar General. I'm intimately involved in it because it's so important to our consumer. And I would tell you that, and Jeff alluded to it again, we took 2020 and we quietly got in the best position we've ever been in. We took advantage of that dislocation that was out there.  And that advantage continues today. And to your point, we've made inroads even against all classes of trade, including mass. But also especially even in our class of trade here at discount, we've made extreme moves as well. So we're happy with what we -- where we are. Hey, we always reserve the right to continue to make sure our customer has the ability to shop what she needs. So if that does need to happen, we have the wherewithal to do anything on price that we consider we need to do. But right now, we feel good. And as Jeff indicated, even in this environment where we're seeing some price pressure from CPG like other retailers are, we have a lot of levers at our disposal to make sure that we don't have to pass all that on to the consumer. And that's exactly what you've seen here in Q1 so far. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session and thus concludes our call today. We thank you for your interest and participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our second quarter results and continue to be grateful to our associates for their dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. Despite what remains a challenging operating environment, including additional uncertainties brought on by the Delta variant and pressures on the global supply chain, our teams continue to successfully adapt and deliver for our customers. Because of their efforts, during the quarter, we saw an improvement in customer traffic as compared to Q1 and once again, increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data.  Looking ahead, we remain focused on controlling the things we can control and believe we are well positioned to navigate the current inflationary environment and global supply chain challenges. As always, the health and safety of our employees and customers is our primary focus, while meeting the needs of the communities we serve. And with more than 17,500 stores located within 5 miles of about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience. To that end, we recently hired our first Chief Medical Officer. Going forward, our plans include further expansion of our health offering, with the goal of increasing access to affordable health care products and services, particularly in rural America. Overall, we remain focused on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.  Turning now to our second quarter performance. As we continue to lap difficult quarterly sales comparisons from the prior year, net sales decreased 0.4% to $8.7 billion, followed by a 24.4% increase in Q2 of 2020. Comp sales declined 4.7% compared to the prior year period, which translates into a robust 14.1% increase on a 2-year stack basis. Our Q2 sales results include a year-over-year decline in customer traffic, which was partially offset by the growth in average basket size. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales were lowest in May, with July being our strongest month of performance. And I'm pleased to report that Q3 is off to a great start.  Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the retention rates of new customers acquired in 2020, underscoring the broadened appeal of our value and convenience proposition. We believe we will ultimately exit the pandemic with a larger, broader and more engaged customer base than when we entered it, resulting in an even stronger foundation from which to grow. Overall, our second quarter results reflect strong execution across many fronts as we continue to strengthen our position while further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.  We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and we believe our unique store footprint, further enhanced through our multiyear initiatives, provides a distinct competitive advantage and positions us well for continued success. As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock significant growth opportunities as we move forward. In short, I feel very good about the underlying strength of the business, and we're confident we are pursuing the right strategies to enable balanced and sustainable growth by creating meaningful long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.  As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. As a reminder, gross profit in Q2 2020 was positively impacted by a significant increase in sales, including net sales growth of 41% in our combined nonconsumables categories. For Q2 2021, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.6%, a decrease of 80 basis points, but an increase of 87 basis points compared to Q2 2019. The decrease compared to Q2 2020 was primarily attributable to : increased transportation costs, a higher LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumable categories and an increase in inventory damages. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups and a reduction shrink as a percentage of sales.  SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.8%, an increase of 138 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail labor and store occupancy costs.  Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the second quarter decreased 18.5% to $849.6 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.8%, a decrease of 219 basis points. And while the unusual and difficult prior year comparison created pressure on our operating margin rate, we're very pleased with the improvement in our profitability on a 2-year basis. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.4% and compares to 21.5% in the second quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the second quarter decreased 13.8% to $2.69, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 27.7% or 24.3% compared to Q2 2019 adjusted EPS over a 2-year period.  Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $5.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 20% overall and 13.7% on a per store basis as we continue to cycle unusually low levels of inventory in Q2 2020, which were driven by extremely strong sales volumes in that quarter.  Similar to Q1, we strategically pulled forward certain inventory purchases during the quarter, particularly in select nonconsumable categories in anticipation of longer lead times. As a result, we were pleased with our strong inventory position for the back-to-school shopping season, and our teams continue to work closely with suppliers to ensure delivery of seasonal and other goods in the remaining back half of the year. Year-to-date through Q2, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $1.3 billion. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $518 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million shares of our common stock for $700 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $98 million. At the end of Q2, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $979 million.  Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of about 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.  Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021, we continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economic recovery, global supply chain, consumer behavior and our business. Despite continued uncertainty, including additional pressure throughout the supply chain and cost inflation, we are updating our full year sales and EPS guidance, which reflects our strong first half performance.  For 2021, we now expect the following : net sales growth of 0.5 point to 1.5 points; a same-store sales decline of 3.5% to 2.5%, which reflects growth of approximately 13% to 14% on a 2-year stack basis; and EPS in the range of $9.60 to $10.20, which reflects a compound annual growth rate in the range of 20% to 24% or approximately 19% to 23% compared to 2019 adjusted EPS over a 2-year period. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 22.5%. Our expectations for real estate projects remain unchanged from what we stated in our earnings release on May 27, 2021.  With regards to share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of our common stock this year compared to our previous expectation of about $2.2 billion. Finally, we are increasing our expectations for capital spending in 2021 to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion to reflect higher equipment costs for store projects and the pull forward of select supply chain investments.  Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of sales, we remain cautious in our 2021 outlook, given the current continued uncertainties arising from COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the expected end of additional federal unemployment benefits.  Turning to gross margin, please keep in mind we will continue to cycle strong gross margin performance from the prior year, where we benefited from a favorable sales mix and a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rates. Much like our Q2 results, we expect continued pressure on our gross margin rate in the second half due to a less favorable sales mix compared to prior year, an increase in markdown rates as we cycle the abnormally low levels in 2020 and higher LIFO provisions as a result of cost of goods increases.  We also anticipate higher supply chain costs in the second half compared to our previous expectations. Like other retailers, our business is seeing the effects of higher cost due to transit and port delays as well as elevated demand for services at third-party carriers. However, despite these challenges, our team was able to meet strong customer demand during the quarter, and we're confident in our ability to continue navigating these transitory pressures.  Finally, please keep in mind that the third quarter represents our most challenging lap of the year from a gross profit rate perspective, following an improvement of 178 basis points in Q3 2020. With regards to SG&A, we now expect about $70 million to $80 million in incremental year-over-year investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. This amount includes $40 million in incremental investments made during the first half of the year. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect our strategic initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. In closing, we are proud of our second quarter results, which are a testament to the performance and strong execution by the entire team. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.  With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team continues to drive strong execution against a robust portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me take you through some of our more recent highlights.  Starting with our nonconsumables initiative or NCI. The NCI offering was available in more than 8,800 stores at the end of Q2, and we continue to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across our NCI store base. In fact, this performance is contributing to an incremental 1% to 2.5% total comp sales increase in NCI stores and a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate as compared to stores without the NCI offering. Overall, we remain on track to expand this offering to a total of more than 11,000 stores by year-end, including over 2,100 stores in our light version, with the goal of completing the rollout of NCI across nearly the entire chain by year-end 2022.  Moving to our newer store concept, pOpshelf, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 8 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 16, including 4 conversions of a traditional Dollar General store into our pOpshelf concept. And while still early, we remain extremely pleased with our results, which continue to exceed our expectations for both sales and gross margin.  We also recently opened our first 2 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop into one of our larger Dollar General market stores, and we're encouraged by the initial results, including positive reaction from customers. For 2021, we remain on track to have a total of up to 50 pOpshelf locations by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts as we continue to lay the foundation for future growth. Overall, we remain very excited about the significant and incremental growth opportunities we see available for this unique and differentiated concept. Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. I'm very pleased to report that during the quarter, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain and are now delivering to more than 17,500 stores from 12 facilities. This important milestone is a direct reflection of the hard work and dedication of the team, and I want to thank them for their incredible execution over the past 2.5 years. Notably, the rollout was completed about 6 months ahead of our initial rollout schedule.  As a reminder, the primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. In fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher inventory markups, and we expect additional benefits going forward as we continue to optimize our network and further leverage our scale.  Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories and we are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of additional products, including both national and private brands. For example, we recently introduced about 25 new and exclusive items under the Armour brand as we continue to optimize our assortment while further differentiating our product offering from others. And while produce was not included in our initial rollout plans, we believe DG Fresh provides a potential path to accelerating our produce offering in up to 10,000 stores over time as we look to further capitalize on our extensive self-distribution capabilities.  Moving to our cooler expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During the first half, we added more than 34,000 cooler doors across our store base and remain on track to install approximately 65,000 cooler doors this year. Notably, the majority of these doors will be in high capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection, all enabled by DG Fresh. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI and DG Fresh, we continue to pursue other gross margin-enhancing opportunities, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink.  Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. In the second quarter, we completed a total of 772 real estate projects, including 270 new stores, 477 remodels and 25 relocations. For the full year, we remain on track to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores. In addition, we now have produce in more than 1,500 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 2,000 stores by year-end.  As a reminder, we recently made key changes to our development strategy, including establishing our larger 8,500 square foot format as our base prototype for nearly all new stores going forward. We're especially pleased with the sales productivity of this larger format as average sales per square foot continue to trend well above an average traditional store. In total, we expect to have nearly 2,000 stores in this format by the end of the year as we look to further enhance our value and convenience proposition, particularly in rural America.  Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our brick-and-mortar footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app, which continues to grow in popularity. In fact, we ended Q2 with nearly 4 million monthly active users on the app, a 28% increase over prior year.  Importantly, as we continue to drive higher levels of digital engagement, our DG Media Network, which we launched in 2018, has become an increasingly more relevant platform for connecting our brand partners with our customers. Of note, during the first half, the number of campaigns on our platform increased 65% compared to the prior year period, and we are very excited about the growth potential of this business as we look to further enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners.  Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties.  Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset.  Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. The first phase of Fast Track consisted of optimizing our rolltainers and case pack sizes, resulting in the more efficient stocking of our stores.  The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in approximately 4,300 stores at the end of Q2, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including customer adoption rates and higher overall satisfaction scores in stores that include this offering. Our plans consist of a broader rollout this year, and we remain focused on introducing self-checkout into the vast majority of our stores by the end of 2022, as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail.  Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs in the communities we serve. As evidence, we recently launched a national hiring event with the goal of hiring up to an additional 50,000 employees by Labor Day, and I am pleased to note that we are on track to meet our goal. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. And because over 75% of our store associates at or above the lead sales associate position were internally placed, employees who joined Dollar General know they have an opportunity to grow their career with us.  We also continue to innovate on the development opportunities we can offer our teams, including continued expansion of our private fleet and those associated with DG Fresh as well as pOpshelf. Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by a robust internal promotion pipeline and staffing above traditional levels. We also held our annual leadership meeting earlier this month, resulting in a rich and virtual development experience for more than 1,500 leaders of our company. This is one of my favorite events every year, and I was once again inspired by the incredible talent and dedication of our people.  In closing, I am proud of our team's performance as we continue to advance our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Overall, we are very pleased with our position as we head into the back half of the year, and I'm excited about the significant growth opportunities ahead. I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our more than 159,000 employees across the company for their unwavering commitment to fulfilling our mission of serving others.  With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So Todd, I wanted to go back to one of the comments you made in the script. You said Q3 is off to a good start -- or great start, you said. Any more color you can provide in terms of what you guys are seeing? Todd Vasos : Yes. Rupesh, we are happy with the way Q3 started out. Back-to-school is doing very well for us. We got all of our products that we anticipated getting from overseas as well as domestically. And the consumer has a little extra money in their pocket. So as evidenced by our guidance in the back half, we feel pretty good about our sales line as we go forward. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And then maybe just one follow-up just on the gross margin line for John. Any more color you can provide in terms of the puts and takes to think about on the gross margin line in the back half of the year? And then if you look at the distribution of freight pressures, would you expect them to persist into next year? John Garratt : Yes. So in terms of gross margin, and I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the performance, up 62 basis points year-to-date. While down 80 basis points in Q2, were up 87 basis points over Q2 2019 as we continue to see initiatives like DG Fresh, NCI and others really contributing. But like with our Q2 results, we do expect some continued pressure on gross margin in the second half due primarily to inflation, which we believe to be transitory, but related to higher transportation costs, higher than previously expected. Of course, we're seeing elevated demand with the great sales, and that's resulting in some transportation and supply capacity challenges with our third-party carriers.  And then on top of that, we did mention a higher LIFO provision as a result of product cost increases. Some others have seen similar inflation and pass some of that along. And then, of course, we have a very challenging lap as we talked about with the year-over-year mix. In Q2, we lapped 40% nonconsumable sales. And so while nonconsumable business is still doing fabulously, it's a very difficult lap in the back half. And certainly, you have a very favorable last year mix profile with that mix. And then you also had unusually low clearance activity associated with nonconsumables on that high sell-through.  So while we expect to continue to do well, it provides a challenging lap. So a difficult lap near-term inflationary pressures, which, again, we believe to be transitory. But as you look ahead, we believe still, that with the growing benefit from initiatives, with all the levers at our disposal between private brands, foreign sourcing, shrink, supply chain efficiencies as we get through the near-term pressures and of course, category management and of course, our scale, we believe we're in a great position to continue to expand margins over the long term and believe we're in a great spot right now in terms of price too and don't see the need to invest there.  So near-term pressure for sure, but the fundamentals of the business, I would say, are stronger than ever, and we feel very good about the future. In terms of how long this persists, we said that we expect this to be elevated through the end of the year, at least through Chinese New Year. It's hard to say how long beyond that. This is really a supply and a demand issue. We would expect this to start to normalize, but it's hard to say, hopefully, as we push through next year, but hard to say exactly when that will happen. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So Todd, maybe could you speak to new customer acquisition that you're seeing today coming out of this crisis? Maybe if we compared it to customer acquisition or customers that shop Dollar General for the first time coming out of the financial crisis. And with that, if you think about the behavior that you're seeing near term, how would you map out traffic versus basket moving forward, just again, given the current customer behavior that you're seeing today? Todd Vasos : Yes, Matt, that's a great question. And I'd tell you what, we are very pleased with what we are seeing with that consumer, especially that new consumer. When you think about -- we launched that retention program back last summer and really pushed the pedal down, if you will, as we move through the back half of last year. And we never took our foot off the accelerator. I'm happy to say that right now, through second quarter, what we're seeing is double our expectation of that retention rate of that newfound consumer. That is higher by a long shot, quite frankly, than what we saw in '08 during the financial crisis. So I attribute that quite frankly to the relevancy of this box that we have today. While we made some really nice changes in -- coming out of that '08-'09 time frame, this box now is much more relevant. And I think the important piece is much more relevant across a broad spectrum of the consumer base. And I believe that's why we're keeping that consumer.  And then when you think about how that mix is looking, as John indicated, we are very, very pleased with our nonconsumable or discretionary side. And that is really enhanced compared to 2008 when you really go back to take a look at it. So not only our consumable business, but our nonconsumable business is doing very, very well.  And then as I look at how some of the other components are looking, think about units for a moment. On a 2-year stack basis, our units were up 11.5%. That is very, very strong. And that's, again, a real testament to the ability for us to drive that top line with these new consumers, and our existing consumers still see that value, obviously, that she needs.  So we'll continue to watch that as we go forward. Our goal, as you know, long term, is always to drive that traffic number. And -- but this consumer, especially our core consumer, acts a little different when she has a little extra money. Just as a reminder, when she has extra money in her pocket, we saw it in '08, we see it now, she comes a little less often, spends more once she comes in, and we've seen that on our numbers. As a matter of fact, our 2-year stack traffic number is up about 25%. And again, very, very robust.  So we believe when things start to normalize and some of this extra money that is in the system through government stimulus may start to wane here, we believe that she'll start coming more often and probably spending a little less, getting back to a normal shopping pattern most likely, Matt. Matthew Boss : That's great color. Maybe just as a follow-up, Todd, or maybe even Jeff, I guess by category, where do you see the most low-hanging fruit remaining on the market share front as we think about where you're focusing your initiative efforts coming out of the pandemic from here? Jeffery Owen : Thank you, Matt. This is Jeff. I'm really proud of the team's ability to really, as you know, they do such a great job of knowing what the customer wants, talking to our customers, but also our category management skills, and our supply chain and our operators give us a lot of flexibility to be able to serve that customer the way she wants to be served. And so very pleased with our DG Fresh rollout and the ability that gives us to continue to broaden that assortment in that very important category for that customer. So very pleased that the gains that we're seeing there.  Of course, also very pleased that our ability to continue to grow our health and beauty business. And I'm very pleased at the share we've seen there as well. And quite frankly, as you think about it, very pleased overall at our ability to grow share in the quarter. And when you look at it on a 2-year basis as well, very pleased and strong results. So I would say, as we look forward, our goal is always to make this box the most relevant it can be and to serve the customer the way she wants to be served and quite frankly, our teams do that better than anybody. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : I wanted to ask on the algorithm into '22. I know it's early and we're not talking guidance. But maybe just some of the puts and takes on the top line, compares will start to ease when you get into next year, but we're also going to be lapping all the stimulus. And then margin picture, some of the pressures could linger into next year. So curious if -- I don't think you'll commit to any algo, but how the puts and takes look in relation to the long-term algo for this business. John Garratt : Yes, Simeon, I'll start by saying that we feel great about the fundamentals and I've never felt better about the algorithm. I'm not going to obviously give any specific guidance on 2022 as we don't normally at this point. And obviously, things are fluid in terms of the duration and depth of the pandemic and how long these inflationary pressures persist.  But as we said, we do believe these are transitory. The team is doing a great job to mitigate these and that would provide a tailwind at some point as these -- we believe, as these normalize, as well as we get to more normalized mix levels. Again, that's the other big pressure this year is just lapping unusually high nonconsumable sales and unusually low clearance activity.  But as you look at the fundamentals, as we've said before, we were at the high end of our 2% to 4% algorithm going into this. We are delighted with what we've seen in terms of the stickiness of the new customers we've brought in, even above expectations, as well as how we've been able to hold on to these larger baskets. And so I think the brand has never been more relevant, and I think this really bodes well going forward on the sales momentum with the initiatives really coming together to help the bottom line and the top line. And again, what we're doing to hang on to these new customers and bigger baskets with this fuller fill-in trip we've been able to provide with the initiatives. And in terms of the gross margin, I would say we still see benefit -- growing benefit from our strategic initiatives with more to come and still have all the levers I mentioned at our disposal and see a lot of opportunity there as things normalize.  So as we push through these, again, what we believe to be transitory pressures, we see ourselves in a position to continue to expand our gross margin. And again, when you tease out the impact of the strategic initiatives to leverage our SG&A at the rates that we have done in the past and then, again, the business generates a tremendous amount of cash, which allows us to buy back shares. So we feel good all around with the outlook for the business and believe the algorithm is very well intact.  And when you look at real estate, that's the other piece I would point to that bodes very well for the future in terms of upping the potential units for everybody on our space to 17,000 units. We're seeing unit level economics as good as ever and we continue to innovate with new formats that continues to extend the runway. So feel great about the algorithm. We'll comment on the specifics of 2022 as we go into the next year. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then the follow-up is regarding the second half, the SNAP and child care tax credits, how much, if any, is factored into your second half top line guide? John Garratt : Yes. What I would say is we've considered all of that. And I would say there's a lot of moving pieces here that seemingly are directionally offsetting. You do have the roll-off of the enhanced unemployment benefits, which is a bit of a headwind, but then you have the child tax credit, which is a bit of a tailwind. And then when you look at SNAP, there's puts and takes there that are directionally offsetting. The 15% benefit expires on October 1. But then with the USDA's action with the Thrifty Food Plan, that puts back some enhanced benefits. And then they did extend the emergency supplemental benefits, which allows waivers -- waivers allows folks to get maximum benefits regardless of income.  So as you look at all the pieces, it's hard to say exactly what the net impact would be, but right now, it looks directionally offsetting, and that's contemplated in the guidance. And we feel very good about the guidance based on what we know now. Operator : Our next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : I just -- to the guidance and the implied second half. So you obviously raised your top line guidance for the full year, but not obviously raised in the second half. But when we look at the guidance for the EBIT margin implied guide for the second half, that's come down despite the higher sales. So I realize you did call out 1 or 2 things, but I still can't get it to quite account for the change in what the implied EBIT margin guidance is for the second half. So maybe a little more color there. And then I had another big picture question. John Garratt : Sure. Okay. No, good question, Karen. I'll start by saying we feel good about the updated guidance based on the strong first half results. And as you mentioned, we did raise our sales outlook. We raised the floor on EPS, held the ceiling on the EPS guidance. But I think when you look at the 2-year lap, it's important to look at what this implies in terms of a 2-year CAGR, and that's a CAGR of 20% to 24%. So we feel great about that outsized performance relative to the algorithm.  What I would tell you is we have seen, as we mentioned, seen increased pressure from freight. And so that is the limiting factor here in terms of the ability to take that up. We did -- as others saw, we did see heightened pressures around transportation to a lesser extent. We mentioned with our LIFO provision, we did see higher costs in terms of product costs, and that's largely a function of some transportation costs being passed through. So really, that's the driver of that.  But again, I would tell you, we feel great about the fundamentals of the business, never been better. And we're going to wait and see how things play out. But that's really the pressures as we look at the back half of the year. And again, we believe them to be transitory in nature and very pleased with the performance based on the -- that the guidance would indicate in terms of being a step change to the top line and the bottom line over the normal algorithm. Karen Short : Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess there's kind of this view that in general, that the lower-end consumer will really struggle next year as all these benefits lap. And I think there's some perspective that, that will negatively impact you disproportionately. I'm not sure I agree with that. But how do you think about the puts and takes to DG, if that is true in general in terms of your core customer feeling much more challenged? Todd Vasos : Yes. Karen, this is Todd. I'll take that one. And I would tell you, we feel very good about this core customer. And also remember, the customer that we've retained during this pandemic and continue to retain, we feel very good about keeping her well engaged into next year as well. You couple that with all the initiatives that we have in front of us, both in play and as you heard from Jeff, some newer ones like health care that will, in fact, start to play out as we go into next year, but even longer term than that.  But when you start to think about who we are, right, and who we serve, we're an all-weather brand and always have been. And it's even more pronounced now, I believe, than every before, right? So when times are good, we do pretty well. And when times aren't so good, that consumer needs us more. And now we've got that new trading customer that we've gotten, that seemingly will have a little bit more money even when times turn a little negative for our core customers.  So once again, we feel good about it. We're not prepared to give guidance yet for '22. But we here always control what we can control. And we feel good about that algorithm over time growing the comps at 2% to 4% over the long term. And that is still our vision, and we work toward that each and every day. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Todd, do you feel like you've worked off some of the excess that a lot of the consumable retailers experienced during the heart of the pandemic? And another way to look at it is your guidance for the back half of the year implies 2-year compound annual sales growth rate of 9% to 10%, which is largely consistent with what you were doing in 2019 prior to the pandemic. So as other consumable retailers are experiencing a drag from a further return to normalcy and less new occasions at home, perhaps you'll face less of a drag because your workers have been working at a work site the whole time. You've got new customers, and you've got your initiatives such that you've entered into a sustainable sales rhythm from here? Todd Vasos : Well, we look at all that, as you say, Michael, and I would tell you, that we do feel good about where this consumer is and how she lines up, if you will, based on what is ahead of her. But again, that whole notion that we control -- what we can control is really what we're squarely focused on.  But yes, I would tell you, the implied number that you're talking about is that in that 4% to 5% type of a comp rate, whether we hit that or not, that's still well on top of our algorithm, if you will. So we feel good about it. I don't want to get ahead of our skis and say that it will be even better. But I would tell you, with the initiatives that we have and the retention rates we're seeing from that new consumer, that's what gives us the confidence to raise that sales guidance in the back half of this year and will propel us into '22. Michael Lasser : Okay. My follow-up question is on the gross margin. The 87 basis point increase over 2019, is it fair for us to assume half of that was due to your initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI, and the other half is from still a favorable environment where promotions have not returned to the level of 2019? And can you quantify this for simplicity's sake, John, how much gross margin pressure you are expecting because of these elevated freight costs? John Garratt : Yes. In terms of -- when you strip out the noise of the freight costs, it is the same fundamental drivers, and we continue to see huge benefits from initiatives like DG Fresh, NCI. And again, we've been talking for several quarters around as we kept calling out the 3 biggest drivers, it was lower product costs associated with DG Fresh. It was lower markdowns and favorable mix, and a big driver of that was NCI. So we're continuing to see those benefits. They're continuing to grow. I don't want to give a specific number on that, but I would say, that continues to be the biggest drivers of -- when you strip out the noise of what's been the biggest levers to improve our gross margin.  So that's not changed. What has changed is, one, the much more difficult lap of NCI from -- of the 40% nonconsumable growth we lapped in this quarter and then the heightened pressures associated with freight and, to a lesser extent, product costs. So the fundamentals are unchanged. That's really the drivers. We didn't give a specific number on freight, but what I would tell you is, as we listed out the headwinds, that was the #1 headwind that we called out. And then we did say, as we look in the back half of the year, that's similar to Q2, we expect that to be a -- although we think it's transitory over the longer term, that continues to be a growing headwind for us versus what we previously thought. Operator : Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. John Heinbockel : Todd, I got two, but I want to start with -- you guys have always said the biggest share donor to you are the drug stores. So I'm curious about your thoughts on health care. And then in particular, when you think about services, product, maybe is there an opportunity to partner with independent pharmacists in a way? How do you think about the sources and magnitude of that opportunity? Does that rise to a NCI type of opportunity do you think in magnitude? Todd Vasos : Yes, John, that's a great question, and thanks for asking it because we're pretty excited about what this health care initiative could hold. But I want to caution everybody, this will be a journey over many years, right? But what we're going to be squarely focused on here is exactly what you talked about, those services that rural America today especially doesn't have access to. We talk a lot about grocery deserts or food deserts. There's as equal health care deserts out there across the U.S., and we're in all of these communities.  And then when you step back from that, with my background in health, we really know that there's an opportunity for these services. So whether it be eye care as an example, whether it be telemedicine, whether it be prescription delivery, not -- by the way, not pharmacies in our stores, but build to order and maybe pick up inside of our store, those type of things, mail order.  And so could we benefit with a partnership? Possibly. We're going to be fishing all that out over the next many quarters. But could it be bigger than NCI? I think this could easily eclipse NCI. I don't want to get in front of our skis, but it could be a really big deal not only for our top line and bottom line at Dollar General, but even more so making that box even more relevant to those consumers in rural America that have to drive now 30, 40 minutes for an eye exam as an example, or even to see a doctor. So we believe that there's some real opportunity here. You can probably tell in my voice, I'm pretty excited about it, but the journey is just beginning. John Heinbockel : And maybe just as a follow-up to that, right? When you think about doing the store-within-a-store right in the DG Markets. And I know I ask this all the time, but the box is getting bigger. Does the small version of DG Market eventually come on the radar screen again as another format, where you'd rather use the 8,500 to accomplish that? Todd Vasos : No, John, we've got a smaller version of the DG Market already. As a matter of fact, we continue to grow that. And that -- the genesis of that was the Walmart Express stores that we bought back a few years ago. And we've cultivated those 44 stores we bought and have grown that format as well. We don't talk about it a lot, because we believe that over time, it could be a big piece, though, of our rural strategy, especially you just mentioned in that combo piece.  Because if -- we already have stores in -- within 75% of our stores within 5-mile radius of the overall population. And if we could give her even more options, including health care, including pOpshelf inside of a smaller box, I believe it could be really powerful. And I know Jeff believes that as well, and we'll be working toward that over the next few years. Operator : Our next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Kelly Bania : Just in terms of freight, just to be clear, how much of that is domestic versus ocean freight? And how much are you passing along or not passing along in the current environment? Todd Vasos : Yes. I would tell you that the majority of the headwind is coming from the import side of that equation. We have seen some tightness in the domestic market, but pretty manageable overall there. It really is the import side that we feel is the headwind here.  And then as far as passing along, what we do here at Dollar General, probably better than most is negotiate with our vendors, with our size and scale. We've been doing that for many years. It's second nature to us, if you will. But I would tell you that we've been able to offset some of these inflationary pressures that you've seen out there. But yet, we have taken price in some instances. But what I'm happy to say is that our price positioning is as good as it's ever been.  As you may remember over the last few quarters, I've been very bullish on our positioning and it's just as good as ever. So I would tell you, we've been very thoughtful on passing along price, because we know that our core consumer can ill afford very many price increases. But we have the ability with just 10,000 to 12,000 SKUs to also pick and choose the SKUs that we offer our consumer. And if we have some price increases that we don't believe we should pass on to her, we'll drop the SKU and move on to something else that, in fact, she'll need also. And we've done that a lot in the last quarter to 2 quarters. Kelly Bania : Great. That's very helpful. And just also wanted to follow up on a comment you made. You talked about some of the puts and takes in terms of the macro in the back half, including the end of the extended unemployment benefits. I was just curious what you are seeing in some of those states, both from impact on the top line when those states ended the benefits and also just in the wage and employee environment. John Garratt : Yes. What we have seen is when you look at the employee environment, I'll start with that. What we initially saw as those states rolled off the enhanced unemployment benefits. What we did see was an initial nice pickup in applicant flow and staffing. The good news now is we're seeing that across the system. And so it's hard to discern that impact now because everything is up. And so that's been helpful. We did see a little bit, not a huge impact, but we did see a little bit of a negative impact in states when the enhanced unemployment benefits rolled off. But then as I mentioned, then you have the benefit of the child tax credit. And that's why we said as we look at all the puts and takes, the way we see it now, we think it's directionally offsetting. Operator : Our last question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Just had two things to ask on. One was just a little bit surprised on some of the discretionary headwind, given the strength that we've seen from some other retailers in that area. So I was just hoping you could help explain a little bit more why that would be a headwind? And then what's the timing for that to kind of roll off? And then the follow-up was on traffic. Todd Vasos : Yes. I would tell you, Michael, I think the discretionary headwind that we talk about really stems from the robust number we had last year. Last year, other retailers were either shut down still, limited hours, one-way aisles. I think you remember all of that. We were pretty much in full swing last year, helping out all the communities that we serve. So it was really on a 2-year stack basis, we couldn't be more happier or proud of our discretionary business. As a matter of fact, feel very robust about it going into the back half of the year and in years to come because of our NCI initiatives, because of our pOpshelf initiatives and many other things that we're working on.  So yes, I wouldn't characterize it any other way other than on a year-over-year basis is really the headwind. I would tell you that starts to subside as we move into '22, right? And so watch out for that as we move into '22. But right now, we feel good about where we are on a discretionary platform basis. Michael Montani : Okay. Great. And then just wanted to clarify on the 2-year traffic stack for 2Q and 1Q. Was 2Q a high single-digit decline on traffic, if you do a 2-year stack? Just trying to see how that's been trending. Todd Vasos : Yes. I would tell you, we really haven't said what those numbers were, but as I mentioned earlier, we just have to remember, on the traffic side, you've got 2 things that are in play here. Number one, you still have a consumer that is contracting her shopping patterns due to COVID, right? You still have some of that dynamic going on, not as much as we saw last year, obviously, and we're starting to see those traffic numbers come back, and I'll explain that in a second.  What we're starting to see now is as stimulus starts to wane, COVID in many states starting to wane, I know it's flaring in certain states and a little less than others. The consumer is getting out more, and we're seeing our traffic numbers start to rebound. And what normally happens with our core consumer as that dynamic takes place, especially around her income levels, what we'll start to see is smaller basket sizes and more traffic. And that's exactly what we're starting to see occur over the last couple of months, and we anticipate that to continue as we move through the back half of the year. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd Vasos for closing comments. Todd Vasos : Well, thank you very much for all the questions, and thanks for your interest in Dollar General. I want to start by saying how proud I am of this team, which continues to execute at a high level, resulting in another great quarter.  As you heard today, we have a number of exciting initiatives in place, and we believe we are well positioned to grow same-store sales, new stores, operating profit margins and market share over time, while providing a strong employee proposition. So overall, I'm proud of the year-to-date results, feel very good about the underlying business and very optimistic about the future.  Thank you for listening. And I hope you have a great day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today is Thursday, December 2, 2021. [Operator Instructions] The call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Donny Lau, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy. Mr. Lau, you may begin your conference. Donny Lau : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; Jeff Owen, our COO; and John Garratt, our CFO.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter results, and I want to thank our associates for their unwavering commitment to meeting the needs of our customers, communities and each other. Despite what continues to be a challenging operating environment, including elevated cost pressures and broad-based supply chain disruptions, our teams remained focused on controlling what we can control and they are delivering for our customers. We are grateful for their efforts. Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current environment. And although we've experienced higher-than-expected costs, both from a product and supply chain perspective, we're very confident in our price position as our price indexes relative to our competitors and other classes of trade remain in line with our targeted and historical ranges. And because so many families depend on us for everyday essentials, at the right price, we believe products at the $1 price point are important for our customers, and they will continue to have a significant presence in our assortment. In fact, approximately 20% of our overall assortment remains at $1 or less. And moving forward, we will continue to foster and grow this program where appropriate. As the largest retailer in the U.S. by store count, with over 18,000 stores located within 5 miles of about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe our presence in local communities across the country provides another distinct advantage and positions us well for continued success. Overall, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to strengthen our competitive position, while further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape. To that end, I'm excited to share an update on some of our more recent plans. First, as you saw in our release, we expect to execute a total of nearly 3,000 real estate projects in 2022, including 1,100 new store openings as we continue to lay and strengthen the foundation for future growth. Of note, these plans include the acceleration of our pOpshelf concept, as we expect to nearly triple our store count next year as compared to our fiscal '21 year-end target of up to 50 locations. In addition, given the sustained performance of our pOpshelf concept, which continues to exceed our expectations, we plan to further accelerate the pace of new store openings as we move ahead, targeting a total of about 1,000 pOpshelf locations by fiscal year-end 2025. Importantly, we anticipate these new pOpshelf locations will be incremental to our annual Dollar General store opening plans as we look to further capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see for both brands. We are also now at the early stages of plans to extend our footprint into Mexico, which will represent our first store locations outside the Continental United States. We believe Mexico represents a compelling expansion opportunity for Dollar General, given its demographics and proximity to the U.S., and we are confident that our unique value and convenience proposition will resonate with the Mexican consumer. While our initial entry into Mexico is focused on piloting a small number of stores in 2022, we expect the seeds we plant today will ultimately turn into additional growth opportunities in the future. Finally, as previously announced, we recently introduced our digital services by partnering with DoorDash to provide delivery in under an hour in over 10,000 locations, further enhancing our convenience proposition while broadening our reach with new customers. Jeff will discuss these updates in more detail later in the call. But first, let's recap some of the top line results for the third quarter. Net sales increased 3.9% to $8.5 billion, following a 17.3% increase in Q3 of 2020. Comp sales declined 0.6% to the prior year quarter, which translates to a robust 11.6% increase on a 2-year stack basis. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales were lowest in September, with October being our strongest month of performance. And I'm pleased to report that Q4 sales to date are trending in line with our expectations. Our third quarter sales results include a year-over-year decline in customer traffic, which was largely offset by growth in average basket size, even as we lapped significant growth in average basket size last year. In addition, during the quarter, we saw an improvement in customer traffic as compared to Q2 of 2021, and we continue to be pleased with the retention of the new customers acquired in 2020. We're also pleased with the market share gains as measured by syndicated data in our frozen and refrigerated product categories. And even as our market share in total highly consumable product sales decreased slightly in Q3, we feel good about our overall share gains on a 2-year stack basis. Collectively, our third quarter results reflect strong execution across many fronts and further validates our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth, while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And as a mature retailer in growth mode, we continue to lay the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock additional growth opportunities as we move forward. Overall, I've never felt better about the underlying business model, and we are excited about the significant growth opportunities we see ahead. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. As a reminder, gross profit in Q3 2020 was positively impacted by a significant increase in sales, including net sales growth of 24% in our combined non-consumable categories. For Q3 2021, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.8%, a decrease of 57 basis points but an increase of 121 basis points compared to Q3 2019. The decrease compared to Q3 2020 was primarily attributable to a higher LIFO provision, increased transportation costs, a greater proportion of sales coming from our consumables category and an increase in inventory damages. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.9%, an increase of 105 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales in the current year period, the most significant of which were retail labor and store occupancy costs. The quarter also included $16 million of disaster-related expenses attributable to Hurricane Ida. Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the third quarter decreased 13.9% to $665.6 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 7.8%, a decrease of 162 basis points. And while the unusual and difficult prior year comparison created pressure on our operating margin rate, we're very pleased with the improvement of 78 basis points compared to Q3 2019. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% and compares to 21.6% in the third quarter last year. Finally, EPS for Q3 decreased 10% to $2.08, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 21% over a 2-year period. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term, while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $5.3 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 5.4% overall and a decrease of 0.1% on a per store basis. And while we're not satisfied with our overall in-stock levels, we continue to make good progress and are focused on improving our in-stock position, particularly in our consumables business. Looking ahead, we are pleased with our inventory position for the holiday shopping season, and our teams continue to work closely with suppliers to ensure delivery of goods for the remainder of the year. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $2.2 billion. Capital expenditures through the first 3 quarters were $779 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $360 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $97 million. At the end of Q3, the total remaining authorization for future repurchases was $619 million. We announced today that our Board has increased its authorization by $2 billion. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, including any changes in consumer behavior and the corresponding impacts on our business. Despite continued uncertainty, including cost inflation and ongoing pressure throughout the supply chain, we are updating our sales and EPS guidance, which reflects our strong performance through the first 3 quarters as well as our expectations for Q4. For 2021, we now expect the following : net sales growth of approximately 1% to 1.5%; a same-store sales decline of approximately 3% to 2.5%, but which reflects growth of approximately 13% to 14% on a 2-year stack basis; and EPS in the range of $9.90 to $10.20, which reflects a compound annual growth rate in the range of 22% to 24% or approximately 21% to 23% compared to 2019 adjusted EPS over a 2-year period. Our EPS guidance now assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. Finally, our expectations for capital spending, share repurchases and real estate projects remain unchanged from what we stated in our earnings release on August 26, 2021. Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of sales, we remain cautious in our outlook over the next couple of months, given the continued uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional supply chain disruptions and the impact of the end of certain federal aid, such as additional unemployment benefits and stimulus payments. Turning to gross margin, please keep in mind, we will continue to cycle strong gross margin performance from the prior year, where we benefited from a favorable sales mix and a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rate. Consistent with Q2 and Q3, we expect continued pressure on our gross margin rate in the fourth quarter due to a higher LIFO provision as a result of cost of goods increases, a less favorable sales mix compared to the prior year quarter and an increase in markdown rates as we continue to cycle the abnormally low levels in 2020. We also anticipate higher supply chain costs in Q4 compared to the 2020 period. Like other retailers, our business continues to be impacted by higher costs due to transit and port delays as well as elevated demand for services at third-party carriers. However, despite these challenges, we're confident in our ability to continue navigating these transitory pressures. With regards to SG&A, we continue to expect about $70 million to $80 million in incremental year-over-year investments in our strategic initiatives. This amount includes $56 million in incremental investments made during the first 3 quarters of 2021. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect our strategic initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh, as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. Finally, our updated guidance does not include any impact from the proposed federal vaccine and testing mandate, including potential disruptions to the business or labor market or any incremental expense. In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter results, which are a testament to the strong performance and execution by the team. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did a great job this quarter executing against a robust portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me highlight some of our more recent efforts. Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI. The NCI offering was available in nearly 11,000 stores at the end of Q3 and we continue to be very pleased with the strong performance we are seeing across our NCI store base. Notably, this performance is contributing an incremental 2.5% total comp sales increase on average and NCI stores, along with a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate as compared to stores without the NCI offering. Overall, we now plan to expand this offering to a total of more than 11,500 stores by year-end, including over 2,000 stores in our light version and we expect to complete the rollout of NCI across nearly the entire chain by year-end 2022. Moving to our pOpshelf concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a unique in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we added 14 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 30, opened our first 14 store-within-a-store concepts and celebrated the 1-year anniversary of our first pOpshelf store opening. For 2021, we remain on track to have a total of up to 50 pOpshelf locations by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop into one of our larger format Dollar General Market stores. Importantly, as Todd noted earlier, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our pOpshelf stores, which have far exceeded our expectations for both sales and gross margin. In fact, we anticipate year 1 annualized sales volumes for our current locations to be between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, and expect the initial average gross margin rate for these stores to exceed 40%. We believe this bodes well for the future as we move towards our goal of about 1,000 pOpshelf locations by year-end 2025. Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in Q2 and are now delivering to more than 18,000 stores from 12 facilities. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing as DG Fresh remains a meaningful contributor to our gross margin rate. Another goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories, and we are very happy with the performance on this front as overall comp sales of our frozen and refrigerated goods outperformed all other product categories in Q3, even against the difficult prior year sales comparison. Going forward, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors  and associated sales. With regards to our cooler expansion program, during the first 3 quarters, we added more than 52,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install approximately 65,000 additional cooler doors in 2021, the majority of which will be in high-capacity coolers. Turning now to an update on our expanded health offering, which consists of about 30% more feet of selling space and nearly 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 800 stores at the end of Q3, with plans to expand to approximately 1,000 stores by year-end. Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time, particularly in rural America. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink. Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. We recently celebrated a significant milestone with the opening of our 18,000th store, which reflects the fantastic work of our best-in-class real estate team as we continue to expand our footprint and further enhance our ability to serve additional customers. Through the first 3 quarters, we completed a total of 2,386 real estate projects, including 798 new stores, 1,506 remodels and 82 relocations. For 2021, we remain on track to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores, representing 2,900 real estate projects in total. In addition, we now have produce in approximately 1,900 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of over 2,000 stores by year-end. For 2022, we plan to execute 2,980 real estate projects in total, including 1,110 new stores, 1,750 remodels and 120 store relocations. We also plan to add produce in approximately 1,000 additional stores next year, with the goal of ultimately expanding this offering to a total of up to 10,000 stores over time. Of note, we expect approximately 800 of our new stores in 2022 to be in our larger 8,500 square foot new store prototype, allowing for a more optimal assortment and room to accommodate future growth. Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the sales productivity of this larger format as average sales per square foot continue to trend about 15% above an average traditional store. Our 2022 real estate plans also include opening approximately 100 additional pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of pOpshelf stores to about 150 by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts. As Todd noted, we are also very excited about our plans to expand our footprint internationally for the first time, with plans to open up to 10 stores in Mexico by year-end 2022 as we look to extend our value and convenience offering to even more communities, while continuing to lay the foundation for future growth. Overall, our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. And the good news is we believe we still have a long runway for new unit growth ahead of us. In fact, across our Dollar General, pOpshelf and DGX format types, we estimate there are approximately 17,000 new store opportunities potentially available in the Continental United States alone. Although these opportunities are available to all small box retailers, we expect to continue capturing a disproportionate share as we move forward. And while still early, we expect our entry into Mexico will ultimately unlock a significant number of additional new unit opportunities in the years to come. When taken together, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and we are excited about the significant new store opportunities ahead. Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical store footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for our customers. Our efforts remain centered around building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. Of note, we ended Q3 with over 4.4 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. As Todd noted, our partnership with DoorDash is another example of meeting the evolving needs of our customers by providing the savings offered by Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. And while still early, we are pleased with the initial results, including better-than-expected customer trial, strong repurchase rates, high levels of sales incrementality and a broadening of our customer base. Our DG Media Network, which we launched in 2018, is also seeing strong results, including significant growth in the number of campaigns on our platform. Overall, we remain very excited about the long-term growth potential of this business, and we look to better connect our brand partners with our customers in a way that is accretive to the customer experience.  Going forward, our plans include providing more relevant, meaningful and personalized offerings with the goal of driving even higher levels of customer engagement across our digital ecosystem. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability.  The first phase of Fast Track consisted of both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which has led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Looking ahead, our plans now include expanding this offering to over 6,000 stores by year-end 2021 and to the majority of our store base by the end of 2022 as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs in the communities we serve. As evidence, in 2022, we plan to create more than 8,000 net new jobs. In addition, our growth also fosters an environment, where employees have opportunities to advance to roles with increasing levels of responsibility and meaningful wage growth and a relatively short time frame. In fact, over 75% of our store associates at or above the lead sales associate position were internally placed, and we continue to innovate on the development opportunities we offer our teams. Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by our robust promotion pipeline, healthy applicant flows and staffing above traditional levels. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. We also recently completed our annual community giving campaign, where our employees came together to raise funds for a variety of important causes. And I was once again inspired by the generosity and compassion of our people. Our mission of serving others is deeply embedded in the daily culture at Dollar General, and I am so proud to be a part of such an incredible team.  In closing, we are making great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. And with the actions and multiyear initiatives we have in place, we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value creation. As we are in the midst of a truly unique and busy holiday season, I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our more than 162,000 employees across the company for their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.  With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : My first question, I'd like to put the spotlight on the low-income consumer. We have stimulus rolling off, we're going to be lapping massive stimulus in the first half of next year. And on the other side, you have jobs and wages starting to grow. Can you talk about your stance? Are you seeing any signs that the customer is getting stronger or weaker? Todd Vasos : Simeon, it's Todd. I would tell you that our core consumer continues to be in pretty good shape. You're 100% right that a lot of the stimulus money has now dissipated. But I've always said, and our core customer has always said, as long as she is gainfully employed, that is probably the biggest driver of her confidence to spend. And there is no doubt that she is gainfully employed right now and can work as many hours as she may or may not want to. But as we look through the remainder of this year and into next, we believe that she'll continue to be gainfully employed. And with that, will have money to spend. And then the other thing to think about with this low-cost consumer, to your point, we continue to show great value, right? When you look at how we operate, our pricing is as good as ever against all classes of trade. And as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we're not walking away from a $1 price point. We believe that's so important to her as we continue to move forward. Not that we believe it, she tells us that each and every day. So I think that value and convenience message will continue to resonate with our core consumer. Simeon Gutman : And maybe transitioning to the fourth quarter, more of a near-term financial question, it implies that the fourth quarter EBIT margin is going to be pretty below where it was 2 years ago, I think, by about 80 bps, even though year-to-date, you're up nicely versus 2 years ago and even Q3 was as well. So besides the typical conservatism in the way you model, anything else can we speak to discrete incremental expense for investments? John Garratt : No, nothing incremental in terms of investments. We noted the $70 million, $80 million of investments in the strategic initiatives, which again are accretive overall. And then the other thing we pointed out is just on the gross margin. You certainly have a continued pressure that we anticipate, associated with the supply chain, which, again, we believe that's transitory in nature. It's a supply and demand issue, but we saw that increase as we went into -- from Q2 to Q3, and we expect that to remain elevated year-over-year as we look at Q4.  And then obviously, the other big piece here is inflation. We're seeing higher prices passed along from vendors, and that's showing up in terms of the LIFO provision, which we noted. But that's really the key drivers I would point to on a 2-year basis. And then on a 1-year basis, I would just point to the very difficult lap as we're lapping extremely high sales of nonconsumable goods, which have a higher margin as well as unusually low markdowns around clearance items, just given the extremely high sell-through last year. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on a nice quarter. So Todd, the high end of your full year comp guidance implies a 12.7% stack in the fourth quarter. I think that's more than 100 basis points improvement from the third quarter. Any drivers behind the recent reacceleration in business? Is this value in convenience as you cited in the face of rising cost of living for your core consumer? Or is this confidence based on what you've seen in November? Just any color on the fourth quarter so far. Todd Vasos : Thanks for the question, Matt. As you know, right, we put out a range and we definitely see that the consumer is still shopping at a pretty good rate. But I would tell you there's a lot of the quarter left. So let's make sure we temper that just a bit. But the great thing about Dollar General is that we have never taken our eye off the ball on what that consumer is looking for. And that gives us that confidence as we move through this year and into next on our ability to continue to service that consumer and if there is any trade down that tends to come in that, that consumer will also enjoy those benefits.  And then lastly, we still are very positive on the trade-down consumer that came in during the pandemic or trade-in is probably a better term for it. And those numbers continue to exceed our expectation on retention rate. So we've got that moving through the fourth quarter and into next year as well. So with all that high end of the guidance is very attainable. But on the other side, we've got a lot of quarter left and that's why we give you that nice range. Matthew Boss : Great. It's a perfect follow-up, I think, for my second question. If I use that same math, 12.7% 2-year stack in the fourth quarter, again, high end of your guide exiting the year. It basically translates to a 6% to 7% 1-year comp, and that's double your pre-pandemic 3-year average. I think it was around 3% to 3.5%. So is this new customer acquisition? Is this market share gains? Is this a trade-down consumer? I guess, question being is, how best do you think about your ability to hold some of these gains as we think about next year and beyond? John Garratt : You're right, Matt. This is John. And you're right. As you look at the implied 2-year stacks, it is a significant outperformance versus pre-pandemic levels. And I'd really point to 2 things. You mentioned and Todd mentioned the retention of the new customers that came into the brand. And the other piece I would point to is the larger baskets, growing our baskets on top of basket growth last year.  And so I think both of these are really enabled by the strategic initiatives. The strategic initiatives have really increased the relevance of Dollar General, providing a fuller fill in trip for bigger baskets. You can do more of your grocery shop, you can do more of your home shop on the nonconsumables side, purchase services as well as the broader appeal to these new customers. And I think also the initiatives really highlight and further enhance the unique combination of value and convenience that we bring to the consumer. That's what I see as the key drivers of that outperformance. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Recognizing that your multi-stack -- multiyear stacks are much more difficult than other retailers, your 1-year comps are trailing behind others, suggesting that you might be [ seeing ] some market share this year. Why do you think that is? And what actions do you need to take in order to reverse those market share trends? Todd Vasos : Yes, this is Todd. I would tell you that the way we've been looking at this all along this year has been on a 2-year stack basis, right? Because some of our laps are pretty difficult as you know, Michael. But we're happy with where our 2-year stacks are right now on market share. And quite frankly, in some of our key initiative categories like Fresh, it will outpace where we thought it would be on a market share basis.  We're confident as we go forward that we'll continue to pick up market share at the same rate, if not accelerated as we move into 2022 and beyond, with all of the initiatives that we have. And keep in mind, that value and convenient message resonates across not only our core customer, but many different customer bases. And that is being preserved at all costs. Our pricing continues to be as good, if not -- was as good as I've seen it over the last few quarters and over the last few years. And as we continue to look out, we don't see that changing either. Promotional environment has been pretty tame.  So when you put all that together, we feel that our market share gains will continue to move in a real positive manner with really, the same classes of trade being those donors as we continue to move into '22. Michael Lasser : Understood. And speaking of '22, you were helpful to provide a piece of the formula and the algorithm that you typically target. For next year, would you expect the same-store sales element to be in line with your typical 2% to 4% comp growth that's part of your long-term algorithm? Or given the stimulus roll off along with some of the other uncertainties out there, would you expect another year of below 2% to 4% before returning to that in 2023? John Garratt : Michael, this is John. I'll take the question. What I'll say is it's early to provide specific 2022 guidance, we'll do that on the next call. But as you think about next year, I would tell you, as we said in our prepared comments, we've never felt better about the business model. We feel great about the fundamentals and the initiatives as well as the performance of the real estate, including the new formats that further boost sales.  As you think about headwinds and tailwinds for next year, I do -- and as you think about the cadence of the year, I would point to, as you noted in the first half, Q1, in particular, it's a difficult -- very difficult lap with stimulus. Certainly, that will be a tough lap, but again, I think we're well positioned with the initiatives and the value and convenience we bring to consumers when they need it most.  And then also, as you think about next year in general, we come into the year with elevated inflationary pressures. We have, as we said, expectations that the supply chain costs will continue to be elevated through Q4, and they won't magically drop right out of the gate in Q1 as well as the product cost pressures. But we do think there's reasons to think that this is a supply and demand calculation here. And over time, it will moderate. And so that could flip as you move through the year into a tailwind.  So more to come on the specifics. But as you think about next year, I would tell you the fundamentals are fantastic. But the beginning of the year will be more pressured than the latter part of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : I want to try the EBIT growth question a little differently. So -- for 4Q implied that is, versus 2019. So with the range of basically up 1% to up 14%, maybe just a little more color there. Because even if I back out your LIFO charge, you had a range of kind of 48% to 77% EBIT growth in 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, depending on the quarter. So is this -- how much of this is an expectation on LIFO for 4Q versus supply chain versus maybe not passing on cost increases? And then I had a bigger picture question. John Garratt : I'll take that, Karen. If you look at -- obviously, there's a lot of year left, and it's a pretty dynamic environment. Certainly, there's uncertainties that creates -- that we thought it was prudent to keep the range wide, although narrowing it in half and taking the top half of our earnings and sales guidance. But as we looked at the key pressures and unknowns in Q4, certainly, supply chain remains elevated, and we expect that to remain elevated. And it's unclear as the pandemic continues to evolve, what that's going to mean specifically in terms of supply chain costs, but we do believe that's going to remain elevated as well as with the LIFO provision, that also is a pressure.  What we have done is accrued year-to-date based on our projections of full year inflationary costs passed along to us by vendors. But certainly, that could change as well, although the team, I think, is doing a very good job of mitigating both. And I think compared to some of our peers, we've done quite well in terms of delivering year-to-date, the operating margin expansion. So it's really reflective of those key inflationary pressures, which, again, we believe are transitory in nature, but could still be volatile in the near term. Karen Short : Okay. And then just maybe switching gears to unit opportunity. I guess maybe a little more color on why Mexico, maybe what makes the market attractive? Any color you could give on where your first stores will be and how the supply chain will work? And I guess I ask it also in the context of the fact that, as you point out, there's so much growth opportunity domestically. Do you really need to go into another -- or another country, I guess? Todd Vasos : Karen, this is Todd. We're really excited about that, the potential opportunity. And as you stated, we do have a lot of opportunity right here in the Continental United States. And you know us pretty well. I don't -- we won't take our eye off the ball on that. We are squarely committed, seeing 17,000 opportunities in the Continental United States to put a store between pOpshelf and Dollar General. That hasn't changed and nor has our focus on that.  I think as you look at Mexico, the intriguing piece, there's a couple of things. Number one, as you know, going into another country, it's a little bit more complex than going into your 47 state as an example. So we started working on this well over a year ago. And it takes many years to cultivate this initiative. And as we indicated, up to 10 stores next year is fairly aggressive, but it will take us many years to build out Mexico, right? And with that thought, even though we've got so many opportunities here, why not start now was more our kind of thinking because it will take many years.  We don't want to wait till we're down the road and need to move faster. We do everything pretty methodically here. And we feel that for sure, the right thing to do was to start working on it now, with the intent to put many locations down to Mexico. So where will we start? Well, we'll definitely start closer to home, if you will, that Northern Mexico feels right. So it will be probably more in that area. But it will open up as we continue to look at different opportunities as we go.  And then distribution-wise, stay tuned. We're not quite ready to talk about all that. But as you can imagine, before you start putting a lot of distribution centers in Mexico, we'll need some more critical mass. So we're working that plan as we speak as well. We've got a lot of folks on board already. The team has done a great job using a term that we've been incorporated, if you will, in the country of Mexico. So we're now hiring and able to transact in Mexico. I think that's very important. And that's what we're doing right now and starting to look at how we build out that assortment and what it looks like.  And stay tuned. We're excited, as you can probably tell in my voice, this is a real opportunity for us to continue to grow the brand and continue to move forward with Dollar General in different locations other than just the Continental United States. Operator : Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Katharine McShane : Our first question was just on traffic. I know you mentioned in the prepared comments that it was sequentially better, but still down. We were wondering your thoughts on that, is it something that got better throughout the quarter? And have you seen any meaningful change in traffic in the last few weeks, given the latest variant news? Todd Vasos : Yes. This is Todd. Yes, the traffic number continues to be a little bit soft. But I would tell you that it definitely has been -- it's sequentially better than it was when you look from Q2 to Q3. And as you continue to think about our core consumer, and this is what's so important to continue always to keep in mind, when times are good for her and she has more money, she tends to come less often and spend more. What we've seen in our basket continue to be pretty strong throughout. And so that always happens with our core customer in better times economically for her, and that's what she's seen. And then as things switch, if they start to switch, then you'll see her come more often and spend less. So those smaller baskets tend to then grow and that traffic number tends to pick up. We're squarely focused on it. We're not -- we're definitely not happy with traffic overall because we love to see positive, but we understand the drivers and the reasons. And we'll make sure that as things continue to progress, that we're squarely focused on driving traffic and price and convenience is our big mantra, and we'll continue to make sure that both of those are well intact for our core consumer. Katharine McShane : Okay. And I just want to ask one question on pOpshelf. You had mentioned several times, it's exceeding expectations. We were just wondering if there were certain merchandise categories that have been stronger than expected. And just what the quarter looked like for this concept, given the majority of what you're selling is discretionary? Jeffery Owen : Thanks, Kate. This is Jeff. And you're right, we are excited about pOpshelf, and we continue to be very, very pleased with how our customers are responding really to the entire box. And very excited that we're going to triple the store count in 2022 and laying the groundwork for 1,000 stores by 2025. So I think you can tell by our bullish news and our excitement, just how excited we are with what the customer is telling us.  When you think about the store in general, there's many areas that she is gravitating towards and responding well. And quite frankly, there's more than we have time to talk about. But I would tell you right now, certainly, we love what she's seeing around the toys that we've offered, we've got great -- in the home area, she's really finding ways. When you think about it, the majority -- over 90% of our items are less than $5. She's really finding ways that she can treat herself and has a lot of fun in the shopping environment.  And so the team continues. We're just getting started here. We'll get better and better and better. But right now, that concept is really, really performing great, and we're really excited about how it's going to complement the traditional Dollar General network as we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : I also had a few questions on the pOpshelf concept. So first, as you look at the pOpshelf acceleration, how does that impact your longer-term algorithm? And then secondly, as you look at the pOpshelf in-store concept, just curious how you guys think about that in the coming years? John Garratt : I'll take the first part of that question, Rupesh. I think it's important to note, and Todd touched on this in his prepared comments, that as we look at pOpshelf, we see this as additive to our Dollar General banner growth plans. And the other thing we've noted is we see over time, as many as 3,000 additional store opportunities from this, incremental to the 13,000 DG banner opportunities. We're accelerating it rapidly, effectively tripling the number of stores next year as we add 100 on top of 50, and then look to have 1,000 by the end of 2025.  So as you think of the algorithm going forward, I don't want to give any specific long-term guidance at this point, but I think it's important to note that it is additive. As you look at next year, the 100 is additive on top of the 1,000 DG stores, and that's the way we look at that going forward. While in the near term, you do have start-up costs that offset the near-term benefits, but when you look at the fantastic unit level economics of these stores, and we've talked about these, $1.7 million to $2 million sales margins that we see as 40% and growing over time. It's just fantastic unit level economics that we anticipate and fully expect to be increasingly accretive to operating profit long term as we scale it. Jeffery Owen : And Rupesh, I'll talk about the store-within-a-store concept that you mentioned, like pOpshelf, we're very excited about what we're seeing here as well. This is obviously very new here, just been in stores just a few months. But very pleased with what we're seeing again from the customer. And when you think about this store-within-a-store concept, really what it is able to do is it takes about 70% to 80% of the pOpshelf assortment and right inside this Dollar General Market. And so the store-within-a-store, as you look forward, will continue, as we mentioned earlier, to expand that. But as we think about the long term here, we recently announced a larger square foot store format, which we've talked about, pleased with that productivity. But again, things like that give us the opportunity to create enough theater to perhaps bring some of that merchandise into the broader assortment of the Dollar General network. So we'll have to wait and see long term as we look forward, but the team is continuing to refine and look at ways that we can continue to learn from this store-within-a-store just like we learned from NCI and how it really was the genesis for pOpshelf to begin. So more to come, but very pleased with the store-within-a-store concept and our ability to grow that over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Can you talk about what you tend to see when a drug store closes in your trade area? Any quantification of any lift that a nearby DG store might get? And then second, just one follow-up on pOpshelf. I was curious about the geographic rollout. Is that going to be kind of concentrated as you think about next year's openings? Or more spread throughout the country? Todd Vasos : Yes. This is Todd. I'll take that. If you think about the drugstore business, the drug business has been our biggest donor of share over the many years, we've been very vocal about that. And with our health initiatives, we continue to gain more and more share from consumers around health and beauty in general. And so when any competitor, as you can imagine, goes out in the marketplace, it does -- it gives us an opportunity to garner more share in that area.  Drugstores tend to exist, if you will, in areas that have multiple competitors in them. And that normally spreads out across many competitors. But we're squarely focused on anytime, just gaining share and any opportunity. So we'll continue to watch that very, very carefully. But we believe we're in great position just overall to continue to capitalize on health and beauty in general. And then on the pOpshelf question, we'll continue to look -- call it, Southern Midwest to that Southeast is really where we're focused on right now, early on. Mid-Atlantic to a degree too, if you think about Mid-Atlantic being that Virginia type area down into the Carolinas. Those are the areas right now we're focused on. But over time, we see this across the United States as an opportunity. So we won't be limited to certain geographical areas.  But as we always do, we're very methodical in our rollout. We want to make sure that we're able to supply the goods we need timely and warehouse is important. The great thing about how we've set our warehousing up with this is it's integrated with Dollar General. So we strip all the costs out of that. And we use the mother ship as we talk about the Dollar General mother ship, the brand not only in distribution but in so many different back-of-the-house areas, where we can make this very, very accretive, as John talked about, over the years as we grow the pOpshelf brand. Operator : Next question comes from Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Krisztina Katai : I was just wondering if there were any notable patterns or anything that you could point out to as it relates to performance of rural stores versus some of your urban stores in the quarter? And then also, I guess, with the implied 2-year stack in the fourth quarter, pointing to a potential reacceleration, where do you see the greatest opportunity to start to take back market share? Jeffery Owen : I'll take the first part. This is Jeff. And when you talk about the geographic footprint of our stores, first of all, we're pleased with the balance in terms of our sales performance, and that's one of the real beautiful things about this company is, is just how evenly distributed and how well the company is performing across all geographic. When you think about the rural, earlier in the pandemic, we did see outsized performance in our rural stores. But it's beginning to normalize where it traditionally has performed, where we continue to perform better in rural, but not to the same degree from a disparity standpoint that we saw early in the pandemic. So as things open up, we're seeing performance open up just like we would expect across all of our store base.  So generally speaking, we're very pleased with really, the performance across all of our geographic regions and the demographic regions. So real pleased with what we're seeing there. Todd Vasos : And on the second part of the question, yes, we anticipate as things start to level out in '22. As John indicated, Q1, we still got a pretty big lap with stimulus and other things, the pandemic still in swing in 2021 as we move into '22 early. But as things start to level out as we get into '22 and into mid -- the back end of '22, we believe that the market share gains will probably continue to come from those same areas that were there prior to the pandemic.  And so when you think about it, it's almost against all classes of trade, but definitely, drug being one of the larger [ share owners ] over time. And again, as I indicated earlier, that won't change. We believe that will continue, and will probably accelerate as we continue our initiatives around health and beauty and our health initiatives in general services and such in the years to come. So we feel good about being lined up nicely for market share gains, but we're squarely focused right now on ending Q4 on a high note and moving into 2022. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Todd Vasos for closing comments. Todd Vasos : Thank you for all the questions, and thanks for your interest in Dollar General. I'll wrap up things by saying we're very pleased with the third quarter results, which I think speaks to our strategy, our culture, and the great execution by our team, even in a constantly evolving environment.  As we look forward, I'm very optimistic about our robust set of initiatives, including today's announcements to accelerate the pace of new unit growth at pOpshelf and expand internationally for the first time. As I said earlier, I never have felt better about the underlying business model. And in fact, I believe this is a much different company than it was just a few years ago and that we are very well positioned to capitalize on the enormous growth opportunities we see in front of us.  Thank you for listening. Have a great day and a happy holiday. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

Todd Vasos : Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal year results, and I want to thank our associates for their unwavering commitment to meeting the critical needs of our communities, particularly over the past 2 years of the COVID pandemic. Our fourth quarter performance was impacted by sustained and rising inflation, ongoing global supply chain pressure and a surge in Omicron cases, which impacted staffing levels at our distribution centers, contributing to elevated out-of-stocks. Despite these challenging conditions, our teams continued to focus on controlling what we can control and being there for our customers. Because of their efforts and great execution over the past 2 years, we believe our underlying business is even stronger than before the pandemic, which positions us well to deliver solid sales and profit growth in 2022 and beyond. And while we expect this challenging environment to persist over the near term, which is reflected in our Q1 and fiscal 2022 outlook, we're confident we are taking the appropriate actions to manage through this period and deliver on our full year plan. In fact, I'm pleased to report our staffing levels are back to 2019 pre-COVID levels in both our stores and distribution centers, and we are seeing a meaningful improvement in our in-stock positions. Additionally, although we experienced higher-than-expected product and supply chain cost in Q4, we are very confident in our price position as our price indexes, relative to competitors and other classes of trade, remain in line with our targeted and historical ranges. And because so many families depend on us for everyday essentials at the right price, we believe products at the $1 price point are important to our customers, and they will continue to have a significant presence in our assortment. In fact, approximately 20% of our overall assortment is $1 or less. And moving forward, we expect to continue to foster and grow this program where appropriate. And with more than 18,000 stores located within 5 miles about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, even in a challenging economic environment. Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to strengthen our competitive position while further differentiating Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape. Turning now to our fourth quarter performance. Net sales increased 2.8% to $8.7 billion, following a 17.6% increase in Q4 of 2020. Comp sales declined 1.4% compared to the prior year period, which translates into a robust 11.3% increase on a 2-year stack basis. From a monthly cadence perspective, Comp sales were lowest in January, with December being our strongest month of performance. Our fourth quarter sales results include a decline in customer traffic, which was largely offset by growth in average basket size. Notably, our average basket size at year-end was approximately $16 and consisted of nearly 6 items. This compares to an average basket size of about $13 and 5 items at the end of 2019, which we believe reflects the growing impact of our strategic initiatives and a degree of inflation. In addition, we are pleased with the market share gains as measured by syndicated data in our frozen and refrigerated product categories, where we have placed a good deal of emphasis over the past years in an effort to provide customers with an even wider variety of options. And even as our market share in highly consumable product sales decreased slightly in Q4, we feel good about our share gains on a 2-year basis. We are also pleased with the retention rates of new customers acquired in 2020, which continues to exceed our initial expectations. For the full year, net sales increased 1.4% to $34.2 billion, which was on the high end of our full year guidance and on top of a robust 21.6% increase in fiscal 2020. Comp sales for the year decreased 2.8%, which translates into a very healthy 13.5% increase on a 2-year stack basis. In total, we completed more than 2,900 real estate projects during the year, including the opening of our 18,000th Dollar General store and 50 stand-alone pOpshelf locations as we continue to build and strengthen the foundation for future growth. From a position of strength, we also made targeted investments in key areas, including the acceleration of our pOpshelf concept, as well as our most recent initiatives focused on health and international expansion as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth. Overall, we are proud of our fourth quarter and full year results, which further validate our belief that our strategic actions and targeted investments positions us well for continued success while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And while our mission and culture remain unchanged as the foundation for our success, with our robust portfolio of short- and long-term initiatives, I believe Dollar General is a much different company and is in a much stronger competitive position than it was just a few short years ago. As a result, I've never felt better about the underlying business model, and we are excited about the enormous growth opportunities we see ahead. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and the full year, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. As a reminder, gross profit in Q4 2020 and fiscal year 2020 were both positively impacted by a significant increase in sales, including net sales growth of 24% and 28%, respectively, in our combined nonconsumables categories. For Q4 2021, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.2%, a decrease of 131 basis points. The decrease compared to Q4 2020 was primarily attributable to a higher LIFO provision, increased transportation and distribution costs and a greater proportion of sales coming from our consumables category. Of note, while we expect some relief as we move through 2022, our Q4 supply chain expenses were significantly higher compared to Q4 2020, resulting in a headwind to gross margin of approximately $100 million. These factors were partially offset by a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales in higher inventory markups. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22% in the quarter, a decrease of 16 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by lower incremental costs related to COVID-19, lower hurricane-related expenses and a reduction in incentive compensation. These items were partially offset by certain expenses that were higher as a percentage of sales, including retail labor, occupancy costs and depreciation and amortization. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased 8.7% to $797 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.2%, a decrease of 116 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.2% and compares to 22.7% in the fourth quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the fourth quarter decreased 1.9% to $2.57, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 10.6% over a 2-year period. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remained strong and provided us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $5.6 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 7% overall and 1.4% on a per store basis. Importantly, as Todd noted, we have begun to see a meaningful improvement in our in-stock levels since the end of the year and expect continued improvement as we move through 2022, underscoring our optimism that we are well positioned to serve our customers with the products they want and need. In 2021, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $2.9 billion. Total capital expenditures for the year were $1.1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $490 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $97 million. At the end of the year, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $2.1 billion. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Moving to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. First, I want to remind everyone that our fiscal year 2022 includes a 53rd week which will occur during the last period of the fourth quarter. We also continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding, among other things, the impacts on the business arising from the current geopolitical conflict and the recovery from the global COVID pandemic, including recovery of the U.S. economy, changes in consumer behavior, labor markets and government stimulus and assistance programs. Despite these uncertainties, including cost inflation, ongoing pressure in the supply chain and rising fuel costs, we are pleased to provide annual guidance that reflects our confidence in the business. With that in mind, we expect the following for 2022. Net sales growth of approximately 10%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 2 percentage points from the 53rd week; same-store sales growth of approximately 2.5%; and EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate range of 22.5% to 23%. We also expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which includes the impact of increases in the cost of certain building materials as well as continued investment in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth. With regards to shareholder returns, our Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.55 per share, which represents an increase of 31%. We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $2.75 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our continued strong liquidity position, the benefit from the 53rd week and our confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for our business. Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of quarterly cadence, we anticipate both comp sales and EPS growth to be much stronger in the second half of the year than the first half. As a reminder, we are lapping a significant stimulus benefit from Q1 2021, including gross margin expansion of 208 basis points. We also anticipate ongoing cost inflation, including elevated supply chain and fuel costs. While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance, given the unusual lap in the significant inflationary environment in Q1, we are providing more specific detail on our expectations for the first quarter. To that end, we expect a comp sales decline of 1% to 2% in Q1 with an EPS in the range of approximately $2.25 to $2.35. Turning now to gross margin for 2022. We expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI. In addition, we are optimistic that distribution and transportation efficiencies, including significant expansion of our private fleet, could drive additional benefits over the year despite continued cost pressures in the near term. Partially offsetting some of these benefits are rising fuel costs as well as an expected return to recent historical rates of markdowns and shrink, all of which are expected to be headwinds in 2022. With regards to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2022 as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. We also continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track. And we believe these savings in 2022 will offset a portion of an expected increase in wage inflation. In summary, we are proud of our fourth quarter and full year results in 2021, which are a testament to the perseverance and execution by the team. Looking ahead, we are excited about our plans for 2022, including our outlook for sales and EPS growth as well as our planned significant returns to shareholders via an increased dividend payout and increased share repurchases. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing in our business and employees for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, including our plans for 2022. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We have a growing portfolio of initiatives which are contributing to our strong results as well as strengthening the foundation for future growth. Let me take you through some of the recent highlights as well as some of our next steps. Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI, which was available in more than 11,700 stores at the end of 2021. We continued to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across the NCI store base. Notably, NCI stores outperformed non-NCI stores in both average ticket and customer traffic, driving an incremental 2.5% total comp sales increase on average in NCI stores, along with a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate. We expect to realize ongoing sales and margin benefits from NCI in 2022, and we are on track to complete the rollout across nearly the entire chain by the end of the year. Moving to our newest store concept, pOpshelf, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value, with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 25 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 55 and exceeding our initial goal of 50 stores. Additionally, we opened 11 new store within a store concepts during Q4, bringing the total number of Dollar General Market stores with a smaller-footprint pOpshelf store included to a total of 25 at the end of the year. And we continue to be pleased with the results. In 2022, we plan to nearly triple the pOpshelf store count and open up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which would bring us to a total of more than 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations and a total of approximately 50 store-within-a-store concepts. We continue to anticipate year 1 annualized sales volumes for our current locations to be between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, and expect the average gross margin rate for these stores to exceed 40%. In addition to the early success of pOpshelf, we have been able to take some of our learnings and apply them in our Dollar General store base, particularly in further enhancing our nonconsumables offering. Overall, we are very pleased with the results from this unique and differentiated concept, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 pOpshelf locations by year-end 2025. Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multi-phased shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods, along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in 2021 and are now delivering to more than 18,000 stores from 12 facilities. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. Notably, DG Fresh was a meaningful positive contributor to our gross margin rate in 2021, and we expect to see continued benefits in 2022. Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in our frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department. In fact, our perishables department had a high single-digit comp increase in Q4 and contributed more comp sales dollars than any other department for both Q4 and the full year. Importantly, the sales penetration of these categories has increased to approximately 9% as compared to approximately 8% prior to the rollout of DG Fresh. In 2022, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale and deliver an even wider product selection. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. To that end, at the end of Q4, we offered produce in more than 2,100 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 3,000 stores by the end of 2022. Finally, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. During 2021, we added more than 65,000 cooler doors across our store base. In 2022, we again expect to install more than 65,000 additional doors as we continue to build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. Turning now to an update on our expanded health offering, which consists of up to 30% more feet of selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 1,200 stores at the end of 2021, with plans to expand to a total of more than 4,000 stores by the end of 2022. As we move toward becoming more of a health destination, particularly in rural America, our plans include further expansion of our health offering, with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink reduction. Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In 2021, we completed a total of 2,902 real estate projects, including 1,050 new stores, 1,752 remodels and 100 relocations. For 2022, we remain on track to execute nearly 3,000 real estate projects in total, including 1,110 new stores, 1,750 remodels and 120 store relocations. As a reminder, we expect approximately 800 of our new stores in 2022 to be in our larger, 8,500 square foot store format, allowing for an expanded assortment and room to accommodate future growth as we respond to our customers' desire for an even wider product selection. Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the sales productivity of all of our larger-format stores as average sales per square foot are about 15% above an average traditional store. In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth in 2022, and included in our expected new store total, we are very excited about our plans to expand internationally with the goal of opening up to 10 stores in Mexico by the end of 2022. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust with more brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer in the country. And we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for our customers. Our efforts remain centered around building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended 2021 with over 4 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. As with everything we do, the customer is at the center of our digital initiative. Our partnership with DoorDash is the latest example of these efforts as we look to extend the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. This offering was available in more than 10,700 stores at the end of Q4, and we are very pleased with the early results, including our ability to generate profitable transactions as well as better-than-expected customer trial, strong repurchase rates, high levels of sales incrementality and a broadening of our customer base. In addition, our DG Media Network is becoming increasingly more relevant in connecting our brand partners with our customers. To that end, we significantly grew the reach of this network in 2021, increasing from 6 million unique active profiles to more than 75 million, enabling our vendors to now reach over 90% of our DG customers through the DG Media Network. After establishing the foundation over the last few years, we are poised to meaningfully grow this business in 2022 and beyond as we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners while increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business. Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Notably, the Save to Serve program contributed more than $800 million in cumulative cost savings from its inception in 2015 through the end of 2021. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. The first phase of Fast Track consisted of both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which has led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 6,100 stores at the end of 2021. We continue to be pleased with our results, including strong and growing customer adoption rates and high scores on speed and ease of checkout. In 2022, we plan to expand this offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of the year as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail. Looking ahead, the next phase of Fast Track consists of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders in 2022. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will reduce store workload and drive greater efficiencies for our retail associates and leaders. I also want to highlight our growing private fleet, which consisted of more than 700 tractors and accounted for approximately 20% of our outbound transportation fleet at the end of 2021. We are focused on significantly expanding our private fleet in 2022, as we plan to more than double the number of tractors, we expect will account for approximately 40% of our outbound transportation fleet by the end of the year. Importantly, we save an average of 20% of associated costs every time we replace a third-party tractor with one from our private fleet. Moving forward, we believe our private fleet will become an increasingly significant competitive advantage as it gives us greater operational control in our supply chain while further optimizing our cost structure. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we created thousands of new jobs in 2021, providing career growth opportunities for existing associates and the start of a career for many others. In 2022, we now expect to create more than 10,000 net new jobs as a result of our continued growth. Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust, as evidenced by our internal placement of more than 75% of our store associates at or above the lead sales associate position. We also continue to innovate on development for our teams to provide ongoing opportunities for career advancement, and in turn, meaningful wage growth. These investments include offering an enhanced college tuition benefit for our associates and their families as well as continuing to facilitate driver training programs for associates who would like to become drivers in our private fleet. In addition to our focus on development, we continue to focus on further enhancing the associate experience and our strong workplace culture. Collectively, these investments continue to yield positive results across our organization, including healthy applicant flow and strong critical staffing levels. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. Overall, we made significant progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives in 2021. These efforts have further strengthened our foundation and position heading into 2022 as we continue to drive long-term sustainable growth. In closing, I'm proud of the team's strong and resilient performance in 2021. As we enter 2022, we are laser-focused on executing and delivering our robust plans, which we believe will further enhance our unique combination of value and convenience for our customers while delivering strong returns for our shareholders. I want to thank our approximately 163,000 employees for their tireless dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others every day, and I am looking forward to all we will accomplish together in the year ahead. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. So maybe to kick off, Todd, with a number of moving pieces between employment and inflation, could you speak to health of your low-income consumer? How do you view the opportunity to potentially take share in this environment? And just drivers of top line improvement that you see as the year progresses within your 2.5% comp guide. Todd Vasos : Sure, Matt. Thank you for the question. Yes, I'll first start by saying, we've always said here that the health of the consumer, this low-end consumer that we serve the most here at Dollar General, is usually geared and attached to whether they're gainfully employed or not. I'm happy to say that, with the labor market the way it is, that she is gainfully employed, working as many hours as she would like to right now. Matter of fact, we believe that approximately $1.20 increase year-over-year in her wages are in her wallet. So that is a significant amount. Now to your point, there are some other things, other headwinds here that we watch out for. Obviously, inflation has definitely taken a toll on some of that additional wage growth that she's seen. And then recently, over the last couple of weeks, gas prices are up $0.70 a gallon. So that -- we watch that very carefully. Now we always also said that once that gas price reaches over $4 a gallon, which it has now, that we normally see the consumers stay closer to home, which bodes very well for that value and convenient message that we have out there for our core consumer and that we deliver every day. That value and convenient message reigns supreme at the end of the day across the company here at Dollar General and with our core customer. So again, as you think about it, tougher times for the consumer normally means that she needs us more, and we normally start to see a trade-down once that occurs and we'll be watching out for that. Again, that value and convenience really attracts that trade-in, trade-down customer. As far as the drivers of what we believe. Well, our initiatives, Matt, as you know, have been very, very successful over the last 6 to 7 years here at Dollar General. And they're the cornerstone of why we feel confident in our guide for 2022. Obviously a lot of year ahead of us, but those initiatives are truly the cornerstone of that. But then when you think again about that value and convenience message we have, if the market gets a little tighter from a labor perspective or inflation continues to pull more money out of the consumer's wallet, we feel that we're very well positioned as we move through '22 as well. Matthew Boss : Great. And then maybe, John, as a follow-up on gross margin, just to dig a bit deeper. I guess what level of runway remains with DG Fresh in terms of the gross margin opportunity from here? Are you seeing anything in pricing and the promotional landscape as we think about your assumption for markdowns to return to historical levels? And then just last, the net of distribution and transportation efficiencies relative to fuel costs, is that a net headwind, tailwind, neutral? Just kind of trying to size those 3 up in terms of a net for the year. John Garratt : Sure. Sure. So a lot of pieces there. I'll try and attack all those as I kind of walk through the puts and takes of gross margins. I'll start by saying we're really pleased with what we've done with gross margin in recent years. As you look at 2021, it's up about 100 basis over 2019 levels. Now we didn't give specific margin -- gross margin guidance for 2022, but we did mention that Q1 in particular would be pressured as we're lapping a pretty significant expansion last year of 208 basis points that certainly benefited from favorable mix fueled by stimulus. In addition to that tough lap, we have cost inflation continuing in Q1, which is driven by supply chain, fuel and product costs, and to a lesser extent, a return to recent historical rates of markdowns and shrink. Still lower than the pandemic levels, but normalizing a little bit. So certainly, there's some near-term pressures persisting in Q1 in the first part of the year. But bear in mind, as we move through the year, the lap gets easier in the second half as we're lapping the heavy inflation from this year. And just as a frame of reference, in Q4, we had about 200 basis points of added pressure to gross margin from the combination of supply chain, which was about $100 million incremental year-over-year impact; and the LIFO provision, which was $72 million. We don't see this as structural. We anticipate some moderation in cost pressures. We're already seeing this in transportation, supply chain, for instance. Plus, when you look at the benefits of the initiatives and the cost-reduction actions we have in place, we see a growing benefit from that. For instance, if you look at private fleet, we mentioned we're going to double that in size from the end of 2021 to the end of 2022. That drives, as Jeff mentioned, about 20% savings each time we switch from a third-party carrier to in-house. And of course, we have the growing benefit of the initiatives that Todd mentioned, which not only helped the top line but the bottom line when you think of DG Fresh, NCI and pOpshelf. And there's still -- to your other question, there's still a lot of runway there. As we continue to optimize DG Fresh, get the leverage from that now that we can negotiate directly on that and we're top 3 vendors -- or customers, in many cases. NCI, we'll continue the rollout of that and virtually complete that this year. And then you have the growing benefit of pOpshelf, which we mentioned comes out of the ground with margins north of 40% and should only grow from there as we get scale. And we've talked about all the other levers we have. And then not to mention just our ability to leverage our scale as a limited SKU operator. So we've contemplated all this in the EPS guidance, which we feel very good about. While there's some near-term pressures, especially in the early part of the year, we feel great about the initiatives, the other levers we have. And we still believe we can expand gross margin over the long term. Operator : Our next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : So I wanted to just talk a little bit about the longer-term algorithm and relationship between sales growth and EBIT. So when I look at 2022, excluding the extra week, it looks like 8% -- well, it is 8% for the top line, and about 6% EBIT growth. I just want to get a sense, is that the right relationship or algorithm to think about going forward? So like slight EBIT margin expansion off of the 9.3% that I think guiding you're to, excluding the extra week. And then I had a bigger-picture question. John Garratt : Sure. I would say, as you think about the 10% plus model, every element of that is very well intact. Starting at the top, we've never had a bigger pipeline of new unit growth with the -- for everybody in discount retail, about 17,000 potential opportunities there, not to mention Mexico. We're still seeing the same rate unit level economics on the top line, the bottom line and the returns. A ton of initiatives in place to drive sales, as well as we're seeing an outsized bigger impact from real estate. Not only we're seeing a 15% increase in sales per square foot productivity in the bigger box stores, but as we've mentioned, we're accelerating the number of new stores we're putting out there, and again, seeing really good impact on comp sales from the initiatives. And as you look at margin overall, operating margin overall, a lot of levers, as I just mentioned on Matt's question, with gross margin, SG&A. We stay laser-focused on that. We mentioned in the prepared comments, our Save to Serve program is alive and well. And since 2015, we've saved over $800 million from that. And so as you look at all the pieces, each year might be a little bit different. But I think that's the way to think about that, is the unit growth we've talked about, we feel very good about and are accelerating that a bit. We're seeing -- we've talked before about the impact of real estate, 150 to 200 basis points. And we're seeing the benefit at the high end of that. And then you have the initiatives on top of that and all the levers. So feel very good about our ability to drive 10% growth over the long term. And I think directionally, you're thinking about it right in terms of ongoing top line strength in that 2% to 4% comp range; and the ability over time, we believe, to hold, and in cases, expand our EBIT margins. Karen Short : Okay. That's helpful. And then just in general, I think there's definitely been a concern that you're lapping in 2022 tough discretionary comparisons, obviously. You talked about that. But wondering if you could give a little bit of color on how you think about that discretionary specifically and baked -- in terms of expectations baked into your guidance.  And then it sounds like you're certainly not leaning away from discretionary in calendar '22. So maybe just some color on that given that, that is probably a category that will be pressured in the year, this year. John Garratt : Sure. As you think about the non-consumable sales and discretionary sales, what we have contemplated in our guidance is some moderation of that. We still continue to feel great about that side of the business, the growing benefit of the non-consumable initiative as well as the scaling of pOpshelf. But what we have contemplated, given the backdrop from a macro perspective, is somewhat of a moderation of mix back toward consumables, but not going back to where they were. So holding on to a lot of the strength in that business and the mix benefit from that, but some moderation. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : I'm wondering if you've given any thought to the 20% of the mix being $1. Has there been any debate around that mix moving? And then, Todd, you mentioned that at the customer, this could be a good environment for you. I take it as you haven't seen any sign yet that there's been any sensitivity to the current inflation. Todd Vasos : We didn't hear your first part of the question, Simeon. Simeon Gutman : The 20% of the merchandise mix. How do you think about that? Is there debate about changing that? Todd Vasos : The $1 mix. Yes. But I would tell you that every time we talk to our core customer, she tells us the same thing, how important that $1 is so that she can round out her month. We've always said here, it's an unfortunate situation, but our customer runs out of money before that month runs out. And that $1 bridges that last few days for her, always has, and that continues to do so. So what we've done is, in light of that information, also with some of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing on other goods, we've actually leaned into our $1 price point. And what you'll see, if you come into our stores over the near term, will be even more displays of $1 items on end caps and off-shelf displays and really pushing that side of the business because I think our customers will need us even more there. And we believe that over time, we could grow that where appropriate and not even stay at that 20% level. So we feel really good about that $1 price point. And the great thing is our vendor community across the board has leaned into that $1 price point with us as well. Michael Kessler : Right. This is Michael Kessler -- oh. Simeon, you got this? Simeon Gutman : Yes. I just wondered if any signs of trade-down yet? Or there hasn't been any sign? Todd Vasos : Yes. Right now, we haven't seen a lot of trade-down yet. The great thing, though, Simeon, is we actually have a lot of that trade-down already embedded in, and I think there'll be more as inflation comes in. And the reason I say it's embedded in is that we are extremely, extremely confident and glad to see that the gains that we got during COVID, so call it the 2020 gains, we've kept a lot more of those customers than we even thought we would have kept. And that continues. Actually, we saw a slight acceleration of that as we moved through Q4. So it was great to see. And we know that, based on the credit card data and our marketing against that, a lot of these customers are in that trade-down area that would happen when trade down occurs. So we've got some of it already, and I believe we'll get even more as inflation continues to take hold across the U.S. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : I was hoping to just touch on, I guess, on the comp line. I want to better understand the building blocks for comp growth this year, whether you can touch on inflation, traffic, the new store contribution. And the guidance implies an acceleration on the comp line as the year progresses. So I just wanted to better understand, what gives you confidence to drive that acceleration? So just any color there in terms of the stronger trends in the back half of the year. John Garratt : Yes. I think you're thinking about it the right way. As we see our comp growth accelerating, as we move sequentially from quarter-to-quarter throughout the year, and we feel great about -- we've said before, this model works very well at 2% to 4% comp. And we feel very good about the 2.5% comp guide, which would imply a pretty healthy 3-year stack with that. As you look at the building blocks of that, what we're seeing right now is we're retaining -- we're exceeding our expectations in terms of what we've done in terms of retaining the new customers, holding on to those bigger basket sizes. We're seeing a bigger impact from real estate, at the high end of that 150 to 200 basis points we've talked about. And as we mentioned, seeing a growing impact from our initiatives as they scale. And the other thing to point out is we're improving our in-stocks. As we improve our in-stocks, that's driving sales as well. Todd mentioned that we're closely watching the consumer. But history tells us that we do very well in all cycles of the economy. And if the consumer is pressured as they are increasingly with inflation, what we've seen is that customer more productive. With high fuel prices, we've seen them shop, as we mentioned, closer to home. And we've seen trade in, all of which benefit us. So when you put all these pieces together, we feel great about the fundamentals of the business. And we think we're very well positioned, for this backdrop, to deliver that comp we've guided to. And we're going to go after more. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question on the CapEx side. So this year, CapEx as a percent of sales is closer to 4%. And I think historically, you've been in that 2.5% to 3% type range. So going forward, is this the right way to think about CapEx, at a more elevated level? John Garratt : No, great question. There's 2 pieces of that. And we have been, for the last few years, a little above 3%, but rounding down to 3%. This year, we're rounding up to 4%. And there's really 2 things I'd point to there. One is we've stepped up our real estate. We're accelerating our new unit growth, which obviously delivers great returns, and it helps the bottom line, but does add a little bit of CapEx. That impact is outsized this year really due to inflation, steel inflation. It's up substantially, still getting great returns even with that steel inflation factored in, still getting the same returns. We've talked about that 20% to 22% after-tax IRR. But that really is the nearer-term pressure, the commodity pressure from fixtures, HVACs, things like that as we do these projects. That we see that coming back down over time. If you exclude the impact of that near-term inflation, that puts us back to a point where we're back to close to where we were, rounding down to 3%. So we don't see something structurally different here other than we have stepped up our real estate, which is a great decision, which we're pleased with. But it's really the difference in the short term, is that commodity inflation. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : There's puts and takes with your margin outlook for this year. But if you assume you take on a little bit of leverage to buy back stock, it could imply that your operating margin is flat to maybe down 20 basis points versus last year. And if that's right, have all the initiatives that you've deployed translated to Dollar General's operating margin now being about 100 basis points higher than it was in 2019? And to what extent could this be eroded moving forward by a return to promotions and discounting in the broader retail environment? John Garratt : Yes. Look, I'll answer your question. If I don't, let me know. But what I would start with saying is that we continue to see the initiatives contributing to operating margin at or above what we expected. They're delivering across the board. But there are some near-term pressures. We talked about the puts and takes of gross margin. And we -- as you look at the gross margin, the biggest piece of that being inflation. Much of which we don't believe is structural. And we see signs of that easing, and certainly taking actions to make sure that eases. When you look at the SG&A side of that, there, too, we don't see a structural change there. We've talked about some geography as we spend a little bit of SG&A to save more gross margin. Again, those initiatives are delivering at or above what we expected. Throws off the geography a little bit. The other thing we have talked about is we did see some wage inflation above norm. We've said in the past that our wage inflation was running about 3% to 4% pre-pandemic. It was higher this year. As we look ahead to next year, we expect it to be a little bit higher than that 3% to 4%, but lower than what we saw in 2021. And we're already seeing moderation there. And we're in a great spot in terms of staffing levels. So as I look at our EBIT, I don't see anything structurally changing there. And as I mentioned to Karen, you see the ability for us over the long term to modestly increase that over time while driving the top line, too. And so feel very good about the algorithm and our ability to manage all the levers within gross margin and SG&A. Hopefully, that answers your question. Michael Lasser : It's helpful. My follow-up question is the competitive dynamics in the environment are ever so changing. The mass merchants and the grocery stores have been comping well above Dollar General for the last several quarters, which is unique in recent history. And now there's likely to be some changes at you're a big competitor. So how do you see this playing out over the next few quarters? Do you see some of these share changes as just a function of the unique dynamics, and you can reassert the leadership that Dollar General has historically had in the marketplace? Todd Vasos : Yes. So Michael, this is Todd. I would tell you that there's nothing that we see that doesn't suggest that our share gains won't start to come back to historical levels as we move through 2022. There's nothing structural that says that our comps won't get back to a more algorithmic level over time. And I think you have to look at, we had well oversized gains in 2020. And when you start looking on a 2-year stack basis, we stack up pretty well on a comp to our -- to those other classes of trade and by far out-exceeded our chief competitor in the space. So we feel very good. And then you've heard John and myself already talk about all these levers that we have. These are not new, right? These are ones that are well established and some newer ones that are already being embedded in our -- inside of our chain, where we can deliver, we believe, comp sales as we continue to move forward. The first quarter is going to be a little challenged, as we've already said. But as we move through the rest of the year, we feel better and better about where that comp is going to be. And then lastly, I would tell you that, your first part of the question, the competition, I would say it's very much the way it's been. I would tell you, we're on a little over 2 years now of pretty tame promotional environment. Obviously, we've had to take some price as others have done on an everyday basis due to some of the inflationary pressures that have been well documented out there. Matter of fact, our pricing position has never been better. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our indexes are as good if not better than they've ever been. So we feel great about our everyday price. And promotionally, we don't see anything in the near horizon that would say promotional pricing is going to escalate to any large degree. Operator : Our next question is from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : Todd, could you size up for us the impact that in-stocks have had on comps over the past couple of quarters? Particularly in your traffic trends. And looking ahead, where you are on the restoration of those in-stocks. Todd Vasos : Chuck, that's a great question, thanks for it. We believe it had a significant impact in Q4. We called it out in our prepared remarks. And due to many factors, one, obviously, we had some labor challenges in Q3 and Q4, in distribution. We're happy to report that we are now back to pre-pandemic levels on staffing. So we feel good about that. But it constrained our inbound and outbound. We also, if you recall, Jeff indicated in coming out of Q3, that we prioritized seasonal to ensure that our seasonal goods got on to the shelf. That slowed down our everyday goods onto the shelf and obviously gained more out-of-stocks there. Now as we move through Q4 and now into Q1, we feel much, much better about where our in-stock levels are. Are we back to historical levels yet? Not quite. But I don't think anybody is. The majority of our opportunities still lie within the vendor community in that the constraints from the vendor community has continued into Q1, not nearly at the levels we saw at the end of last year. But we continue to work with our vendor partners to ship on time and in full. And once we get to that point, which we believe we're working towards pretty quickly here, we'll be in much, much better shape as we move through the back half of the year. Charles Grom : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then one for Jeff. You called out that sales per square foot in the 8,500 square foot stores is 15% higher than the typical box. I was wondering if you could just unpack the delta, where you're getting that greater productivity from? Jeffery Owen : Thanks, Chuck. We are pleased with our larger-format stores and really seeing that sales per square foot productivity. I think it goes back to what we've started a while ago, and that's really providing a fuller fill-in shop for our customers. When you build a bigger store, anybody can do that. But you got to have what the customer wants. And you got to have a customer that wants more from you. So this 8,500 and above square foot store allows us to really expand all the best of that merchants have brought to bear. So we've got expanded wellness. We've got our NCI in full. We've got our full cooler assortment in these stores as well. An expanded queue line. And quite frankly, room to grow. And so we also have produce in many of these stores as well. And so when you step back and you look at that, that's really what has driven the productivity in these stores. And I can tell you right now that we're just getting started here. And we look to be able to further serve our customer by listening to what she's asking for and leaning on our best-in-class merchant team, our supply chain team and operators that can execute this across a wide, broad group of stores. So feel real good about where that is headed in the future. Operator : Our final question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Thanks for all the great color today. One quick one to start on SNAP. There's been a lot of investor anxiety around reduction in SNAP benefits, what it means for you because it has grown considerably as a percentage of sales. What are you seeing as these payments have decreased? John Garratt : Yes. We've seen a modest decrease as we moved through the year. It peaked middle of the year around May. We've seen it come down a little bit as some of the states rolled off the emergency allotments. But with the Thrifty benefits -- Thrifty Food Plan benefit still in place, it's remained elevated. So if you look at Q4 this year versus Q4 last, still well above where it had been, just not quite where it was at the peak in May. As we move into next year, we're anticipating it to continue to moderate somewhat. However, that may be tapered just based on the cadence of when states roll off of that. So as we look ahead to next year, what we're assuming is that it's down from -- the benefit isn't as much as it was this year, but still elevated to pre-pandemic levels. And again, we've been taking share over a long time with the SNAP customers as we serve them so well, and you'll continue to see that as a key part of our business. Edward Kelly : Great. And then just a follow-up on self-distribution. You talked about significant expansion, doubling this year. Can you talk a bit more about the benefits operationally? I think you mentioned significant competitive advantage. Maybe more detail on what you mean there.  And then from a P&L perspective, this 20% cost saves, is that 20% of domestic freight? Like is that how we think about what you're saying there? Jeffery Owen : Ed, this is Jeff. First of all, thank you for the question. Our private fleet is something we started several years ago. And I think you nailed some of the reasons why we're so excited about it. First of all, our drivers are on the same team as our store teams, our merchant teams, and that's certainly just brings a better service to the overall operation. But also, it allows us much more flexibility in our control over the environment. And when you think about it right now, with about 20% of our outbound fleet, we're pleased with that, but we're even more excited about where this thing goes. And we like to use that term early innings. We're certainly in the early innings of this initiative. And as you mentioned, with the 20% reduction in our outbound transportation every time we convert, it's obviously a very good return. So as you think about this year, we're pleased to be at doubling that to about 40% of our outbound transportation needs. And we look to grow that even further over time as we scale this initiative and really distance ourselves and provide that competitive advantage because it is an incredible lever that we're able to pull. And excited that we started this several years ago. Operator : We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Todd Vasos for closing comments. Todd Vasos : Thank you, and thanks for everyone joining the call and for all the questions. And thanks for your interest in Dollar General. I'm proud of this team, which continues to execute at a high level, even in a consistently evolving environment. As you heard today, we're excited about our initiatives and plans for 2022, which we believe positions us well to grow same-store sales, new stores, operating profit margins and market share over time. Overall, a mature retailer in growth mode, we believe this company is in a very strong position, which I think speaks to our strategy, our resilience and the strength of our culture and our people. As I said earlier, I've never felt better about the underlying business model, and I can't wait to see what 2022 holds for Dollar General. Thank you for listening, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

Todd Vasos : Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our strong start to 2022, and I want to thank our associates for their unwavering commitment to serving our customers, communities and each other. Our Q1 performance was led by stronger-than-expected sales results in our consumable category, where we delivered comp sales growth of 4.6%. This increase was offset by a decline of 15.1% in our combined nonconsumable categories, which we believe reflects the challenging lap of the stimulus benefit in Q1 of 2021. In addition, we continue to experience headwinds from ongoing global supply chain pressures and rising cost inflation. Despite these challenges, we remain focused on controlling what we can control, and the team's disciplined execution was the key to delivering solid financial results that exceeded our Q1 expectations for both sales and EPS while also advancing our key operating priorities and strategic initiatives. I'm also pleased to report that we have continued to make improvements in our overall in-stock position, which we believe positions us well to drive strong top line performance through the remainder of the year. In addition, while we continue to see ongoing product cost inflation, we feel good about our price position as our price indexes relative to competitors and other classes of trade remain in line with our targeted and historical ranges. And with more than 18,000 stores located within 5 miles of about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, especially in a more challenging economic environment. Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to strengthen our competitive position while further differentiating Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape. Now let me recap some of the additional financial results for the first quarter. Despite lapping a difficult quarterly sales comparison from prior year, net sales increased 4.2% to $8.8 billion, and comp sales were essentially flat with a slight decrease of 0.1%. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales were positive in February before turning negative in mid-March as we began to lap the stimulus benefit from prior year. As we move past the most challenging portion of the sales lap from 2021, comp sales turned positive in April, and we are pleased with our strong start to Q2, which has exceeded our initial expectations. As a result of our Q1 outperformance and strong start to Q2, as well as our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our sales outlook for fiscal 2022, which John will discuss in more detail shortly. Our first quarter sales results included a decline in customer traffic, which was mostly offset by growth in average basket size driven largely by inflation. Importantly, we are pleased with our market share gains in highly consumable product category sales for the quarter. These results were highlighted by gains in our frozen and refrigerated product categories, where we have placed a good deal of emphasis over the past few years in an effort to provide customers with an even wider variety of options. I'm also excited to note that we recently published our fourth annual Serving Other Report (sic) [ Serving Others Report ], which provides several important updates on our ongoing ESG efforts, as well as new and updated performance metrics and targets. We are proud of the team's efforts to serve our employees, customers, communities and the environment, and we look forward to continued progress on our journey as we move ahead. Overall, we are proud of our Q1 results. Our mission and culture remain unchanged, and we believe our strategic actions which have transformed this company in recent years positions us well for continued success while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. We continue to operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail, and our unique value and convenience offering continues to resonate with both new and existing customers. I have never felt better about the underlying business model, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2022 and beyond. With that, I will now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all periods noted refer to the corresponding fiscal period. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. As a reminder, we expanded our gross margin rate by 208 basis points in Q1 2021, which was positively impacted by a significant increase in sales, including net sales growth of 16% in our combined nonconsumable categories. For Q1 2022, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.3%, a decrease of 151 basis points. The decrease compared to Q1 2021 was primarily attributable to a greater proportion of sales coming from our consumables category, a higher LIFO provision, increases in transportation costs, markdowns as a percentage of sales and distribution costs and higher inventory damages. Of note, while we have seen some moderation from Q4, our Q1 supply chain expenses were significantly higher compared to Q1 2021, resulting in a headwind to gross margin of approximately $85 million. In addition, product cost inflation was greater than expected, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $61 million during the quarter. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.8%, an increase of 78 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail labor, store occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization and utilities. These increases were partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation and winter storm-related disaster expenses. Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the first quarter decreased 17.9% to $746 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 8.5%, a decrease of 229 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.8% and compares to 22% in the first quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the first quarter decreased 14.5% to $2.41. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $6.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 19.4% overall and 13.3% on a per-store basis. This increase primarily reflects the impact of product cost inflation as well as a greater mix of higher-value products. Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape and that we are well positioned with the right mix and balance of products. Going forward, as Todd mentioned, we expect continued improvement in our overall in-stock levels as we move through 2022, underscoring our optimism that we are well positioned to serve our customers. The business generated cash flow from operations during the quarter totaling $450 million, a decrease of 36%. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $282 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to the strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our common stock for $747 million and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $125 million. At the end of Q1, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.4 billion. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Despite the ongoing uncertainties arising from cost inflation and continued pressure in the supply chain, we are confident in the business. As a result, and as Todd noted, we are increasing our sales outlook for 2022 as we now expect the following : net sales growth of approximately 10% to 10.5%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 2 percentage points from the 53rd week; and same-store sales growth of approximately 3% to 3.5%. Additionally, we are reiterating the remainder of our financial guidance for 2022, which includes EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week; share repurchases of approximately $2.75 billion; and capital spending in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Our updated outlook reflects our strong year-to-date top line performance and current sales expectations for the remainder of the year as well as updated margin and expense expectations. Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of the quarterly cadence, we continue to anticipate both comp sales and EPS growth to be stronger in the second half of the year than the first half. We also expect our share repurchases to be lower in Q2 and Q3 compared to the Q1 amount before increasing in Q4, partially as a result of the extra week in our fiscal year.  Turning now to gross margin for 2022. We expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI throughout the year. In addition, we are optimistic that distribution and transportation efficiencies, including significant expansion of our private fleet, can drive additional benefits despite anticipated continued cost pressures in the near term. Offsetting some of these benefits is an expected increase in sales mix pressure as our sales outperformance has been predominantly driven by growth in our consumables category which generally has a lower gross profit rate than other product categories. In addition, we expect ongoing supply chain pressures, including higher fuel costs, increased product cost inflation and expect to return to pre-pandemic rates of seasonal markdowns and increased inventory damages, all of which are expected to be headwinds in 2022. With regards to SG&A, we expect continued investment in our strategic initiatives as we further the rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit margin in 2022 as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. We also continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track, and we believe these savings in 2022 will offset a portion of expected wage inflation. Finally, our updated outlook includes plans to build on our sales momentum with targeted investments to further enhance the customer experience, including incremental labor hours, to drive an even greater improvement in overall in-stock levels and customer service. In summary, we are proud of our team's resilience and commitment to execution which resulted in our strong first quarter results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thanks, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We are off to a great start to the year as we continue to make good progress across our portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me take you through some of the recent highlights. Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI, which was available in more than 13,000 stores at the end of the first quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across our NCI store base, including continued incremental 2.5% total comp sales increase, on average, in NCI stores in their first year post implementation, along with a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate. We expect to realize ongoing sales and margin benefits from NCI in 2022 and are on track to complete the rollout across nearly the entire chain by the end of the year. Moving to our pOpshelf store concept which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 11 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 66. Additionally, at the end of Q1, we had a total of 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf store into one of our larger-format Dollar General market stores as we continue to be pleased with the results. We are on track to nearly triple the pOpshelf store count this year, as well as open up to 25 store-within-store concepts, which would bring us to a total of more than 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations and a total of approximately 50 store-within-a-store concepts by year-end. We continue to anticipate year 1 annualized sales volumes for pOpshelf locations to be between $1.7 million and $2 million per store and expect the initial average gross margin rate for these stores to exceed 40%. Overall, we are very pleased with the results from this unique and differentiated concept, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 pOpshelf locations by end of 2025. Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods, along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in 2021 and are now delivering to more than 18,000 stores from 12 facilities. The initial objective of DG Fresh was to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in our frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department. Looking ahead, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. To that end, we offered produce in more than 2,300 stores at the end of the first quarter with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 3,000 stores by the end of 2022. Notably, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. In fact, during Q1, we added more than 17,000 cooler doors across our store base, and we are on track to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2022. Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have significant incremental opportunity to drive additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead. Turning now to an update on our expanded health offering, which consists of up to 30% more feet of selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 1,800 stores at the end of Q1, and we are on track to expand to a total of more than 4,000 stores by the end of 2022. Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time, particularly in rural America. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink reduction. Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven, high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In the first quarter, we completed more than 800 real estate projects, including 239 new stores, 532 remodels and 32 relocations. For 2022, our plans remain to execute 2,980 real estate projects in total, including 1,110 new stores, 1,750 remodels and 120 store relocations. As a reminder, we expect approximately 800 of our new stores in 2022 to be in our larger 8,500 square foot store format as we respond to our customers' desire for even wider product selection. With about 1,200 square feet of additional selling space compared to a traditional store, these larger formats allow for expanded high-capacity cooler counts; an extended queue line; and a broader product assortment, including NCI, our larger health and beauty offering; and produce in many stores. Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the unit economics of this larger format. While the initial cost to open these larger stores is about $300,000, including fixed assets and working capital, we are seeing increased sales productivity and continue to generate returns in the range of 20% to 22%. In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth in 2022 and included in our total new store goal, we are also very excited about our plans to expand internationally : the goal of opening up to 10 stores in Mexico by the end of 2022. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust. With more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended Q1 with more than 4 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. Our partnership with DoorDash continues to yield strong results as we look to extend the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. This offering was available in about 11,000 stores at the end of Q1, and we continue to be pleased with the early results, including better-than-expected customer trial, strong repurchase rates, high levels of sales incrementality and a broadening of our customer base. In addition, we are excited about the continued growth of our Dollar General Media Network, which is becoming increasingly more relevant in connecting our participating brand partners with over 90% of our unique customer base. After establishing the foundation over the last few years, we are poised to meaningfully grow this business in 2022 and beyond as we expand the program and further enhance the value proposition for customers and brand partners while increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business. Most recently, we launched a suite of financial offerings as we look to further leverage our unique footprint to provide our customers with additional services they want and need. These services include a spendwell-branded bank account and debit card offering; a buy now, pay later pilot in select number of stores; and a test of a rewards redemption program. These offerings aim to provide greater financial empowerment for customers while driving incremental traffic and profitability within our stores. Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, and we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. The first phase of Fast Track consisted of both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which has led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 8,000 stores at the end of Q1, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates. As a result of the success of self-checkout and popularity with customers, we have recently launched a pilot of stores that are entirely self-checkout. While our associates will remain available to assist customers, if needed, in these stores, we believe this 100% self-checkout option could further enhance the convenience proposition while enabling our associates to dedicate even more time to serving customers. We plan to ultimately test this layout in about 200 stores throughout 2022. Looking ahead, we are on track to expand our self-checkout offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of the year as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small-box discount retail. Moving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consists of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will reduce store workload and drive greater efficiencies for our retail associates and leaders. I also want to highlight our growing private fleet, which consisted of more than 950 tractors at the end of Q1 as compared to over 700 tractors at the end of 2021. As a reminder, we are focused on significantly expanding our private fleet in 2022 as we plan to more than double the number of tractors from 2021, which we expect will account for approximately 40% of our outbound transportation fleet by the end of the year. As a result of this planned growth, we believe our private fleet will become an increasingly significant competitive advantage as it gives us greater operational control within our own supply chain while further optimizing our cost structure. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for personal and professional development and ultimately career advancement. To that end, we recently began offering access to 100% employer-paid college degree programs for all full-time employees. In addition, all Dollar General employees and their immediate family members now have access to online, on-demand, self-paced learning platform that provides college-level general education courses at no cost to them, which is intended to help initiate or further their education journey and development. These programs are in addition to several other existing development programs, including our fully paid private fleet driver training program, as well as the ability to earn undergraduate credits through the American Council on Education upon completion of our store manager training program. We continue to innovate on additional development opportunities for our teams to provide ongoing opportunities for career advancement, and in turn, meaningful wage growth. Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by internal placement rates of more than 75% at or above the lead sales associate position. Additionally, approximately 15% of our private fleet team began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. We continue to monitor our competitive position in the market closely, and we are pleased with our turnover rates, staffing levels and applicant flow, further validating our belief that we are taking the right actions to attract and retain talent. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. Overall, we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, and we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating meaningful value for our shareholders. In closing, I am proud of the team's strong performance, and we are pleased with our great start to the year. I want to thank our more than 164,000 employees for their hard work as we all focus on fulfilling our mission of serving others every day, and I am excited about our plans for the year ahead. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Congratulations on a good quarter. So I wanted to just ask, so obviously, your format is very resilient in a weaker macro and should outperform, in general, in a weaker macro. But I think investors have been very concerned regarding discretionary risk as it relates to the comp and also to gross margin. So I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on how your -- with respect to your guidance on how you're thinking about comps with respect specifically to discretionary versus non and then general gross margin outlook as it relates to both categories because, I mean, my personal view is that you're obviously a lot more resilient than people realize -- or investors realize in terms of both those segments, comps and gross margins. So any color on that would be helpful. John Garratt : Sure. I'll take that question, Karen. With respect to sales -- and with both of these, that's obviously factored in. With respect to sales, feel very good about the raised guidance that we've provided there. We have taken into account that the overperformance was really driven by consumables, so that's been factored into the margin as well. So we continue to feel great about both sides of the business but have reflected the fact that it is more driven by the consumables. And the team has done a fantastic job of proactively adjusting the orders accordingly to minimize markdown risk. The other thing I'll note, just to give a little more color on the shape of the year with regard to sales, the way we see this is as we get past the -- now past the stimulus lap that has a significant impact on last year, both with sales, but also, it's the most difficult -- it's the most difficult, rather, mix lap of the year because they had a disproportionate effect on nonconsumables. Now that we're past that, we see a market improvement in our sales throughout the year, relatively even throughout the year and strongly positive. And then, obviously, you don't have as much -- while we expect a continued mix towards consumables, the lap isn't as significant now that you're past Q1. And again, that's all been reflected. Karen Short : Okay. And then just to clarify, in terms of April meant 2Q off to a strong start. Any more granularity you could provide on that? Todd Vasos : Yes, Karen. We're happy with what -- how we ended Q1. And as I indicated in my opening remarks, pretty upbeat on what we have seen in the first few weeks of Q2. And I would tell you, from a consumer perspective, the consumer is behaving intentional in their purchases, I have to say. But in saying that, she still is shopping both sides of the fence, both consumables and nonconsumables, and I think that really goes to the value that we have in both consumables and nonconsumables side of the business. We've done so much work around that discretionary side with NCI and all the other work that we've done that it's a compelling offering. Even when times are tough for the consumer, she always wants a little bit of an indulgence, and we offer that ability at a real low price. So yes, we feel good about the equation as we move forward, as John indicated. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : How much did trade down contribute -- or customers trading down, those who may be facing some incremental economic stress, contribute to 1Q? How much have you assumed that will contribute to the rest of the year? And in that vein, how much did like-for-like price increases contribute in the quarter? And how much do you expect it to contribute to the rest of the year? Todd Vasos : Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. I'll take that. And I'll tell you that the consumer, overall, has been fairly resilient through this hyperinflation that we've seen, not only in the products that she has to buy, but the fuel she has to put in her car and other means. So I would tell you that the consumer is holding up well, and it really goes toward what I've talked about all along. And that is as long as she's gainfully employed, that makes the biggest difference in how she shops and gives her that confidence to spend.  The great thing at Dollar General is that we offer that value that I just mentioned earlier, and we're already starting to see that our core customers start to shop more intentionally, and we're starting to see that next tier of customers start to shop with us a little bit more as well. Matter of fact, when you look at the COVID customer, I would call it, the one that we attracted and now have retained since COVID, it is still running at or slightly above where we thought we would be right now, and that's a little higher-end consumer. So that tells you that, that trade down and trade in is alive and well and is starting to probably pick up steam as we move through Q2 and into the back part of the year as things continue to tighten up. Lastly I'll mention is the gas prices. What would normally also occur and we're starting to see is she starts to shop closer to home, not only our core consumer, but that next cohort up, so that trade in that you mentioned, because let's admit it, right, the gas price is at $4.40, $4.50 a gallon now, on average, is keeping her closer to home. So those shopping patterns are definitely changing, and we're seeing it happen right before our eyes. Michael Lasser : And at the risk of being a little bit of a downer, and I apologize for that, one of your big competitors this morning announced they're going to be making some investments to narrow the price gap. Do you think you'll need to take down your prices further and maintain that price gap to continue to enjoy the success that Dollar General has achieved? Todd Vasos : Yes. Michael, I would tell you we look at all competitors when we look at our price, and there's some much bigger competitors out there than the one that you are referring to that we watch really closely. The great thing is, is that our prices are right in our historical ranges, and we feel great about price. We've got plenty of ammunition to do whatever we need to do. But I would tell you that we've never felt better about our price position as we continue to move through Q2 and into the back half of the year. We've taken the opportunity, and I've mentioned this before, over the many, many months of -- through COVID to sharpen our prices even more, and I believe that what we're seeing right now against all classes of trade would tell you that Dollar General is in a great spot and has all of the levers that is disposable to continue to keep that positioning. We don't see anything on the horizon that gives us any concern there at all. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on another nice quarter. Todd Vasos : Thank you. John Garratt : Thank you. Matthew Boss : So Todd, on value and convenience, it seems like this is really the key driver that you're citing as one of the main pieces to the continued momentum in the business. I guess how much do you attribute all of this to company-specific top line drivers? What initiatives do you think that you're the most excited about that still have legs? And then more so, as we think about the back half of the year, help us to think about the in-stock opportunity or other key drivers of the business on a year-over-year basis. Todd Vasos : Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. I would tell you that our initiatives continue to push forward and also drive that top line. So if you think of DG Fresh, that continues to be our top driver. But one area that we have started to talk about recently and we'll continue to hear more and more about is our digital initiative, and I would tell you that, that digital initiative will continue to help propel that top line as well. It's driving not only our current customer but a different cohort of customer into Dollar General, and that is that cohort that is a little bit more digitally savvy. We have spent some nice capital over the many years building the platform for this. And really, in earnest, in the last 6 to 8 months, have really turned the dial up on moving that digital piece. So while others are worried about fixing fundamentals, we're really moving the needle forward on a lot of those big initiatives. So you think of DG Fresh, self-distribution of produce coming up in our supply chain as well. You think about digital. And then, of course, we're so excited still about NCI and pOpshelf. POpshelf is performing very well, even in a climate that one would consider the nonconsumable discretionary side of the business may be challenged. But pOpshelf continues to do well. That's what gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward into the upcoming months and years ahead.  So we've got a tremendous amount of drivers, a lot more than value and convenience. But when they come into the store through all these other means that we're driving traffic into the store, they are definitely gravitating to value and convenience because everybody loves a deal. Matthew Boss : Great. And then, John, maybe on the gross margin. How best to think about the build for the second quarter and the back half of the year relative to the first quarter? And just with that, if we think larger picture and maybe similar to my top line question, what inning would you say the company-specific benefits that you've seen from DG Fresh, NCI, maybe the private fleet, what inning are these in today as we think about margin benefits? John Garratt : Sure. No, great questions, Matt. I'll start with the first part of the question, just around how we're looking at gross margin. I'll start by saying we're very pleased with what we've been able to do to hang on to that gross margin goodness. While we were down about 1.5 points this quarter, we were lapping over 2 points of expansion last year. And if you go back to pre-pandemic levels, we're still 1 point above where we were. I think it really speaks to the impact of the initiatives. Now certainly, there are some near-term pressures that we called out. We talked about on the call the pressure from supply chain costs, which were an $85 million year-over-year headwind. Now that was down from Q4, which was $100 million. The other thing that we talked about was the LIFO provision of $61 million that we booked based on the anticipated inflation for the full year. And of course, we had the mix challenge. But again, as I mentioned before, much more pronounced in Q1 as we lap the significant impact of stimulus.  So as we look forward, I mentioned we expect continued pressure on a year-over-year basis, not as much as we saw in Q1 as we get away from stimulus. We also expect continued pressure from supply chain, fuel costs, as well as product cost inflation. However, we expect it to improve as we move through the year. The lapse ease, particularly in the second half of the year, as we lap the very heavy inflation from last year. And we anticipate some moderation. We're seeing some moderation in the cost pressures due, in part, to the benefits of the initiatives and the cost reduction actions we've put in place.  We mentioned the private fleet. We're going to double that in size this year as we convert tractors and trailers in-house that drives 20% savings. And we've done other actions to lock in more third-party capacity to manage our inventory very well, adjust to the changing demand of the customers. So we feel we're very well positioned. And as we look ahead, we're not giving specific guidance on gross margin, but we expect EPS to improve sequentially as we go from quarter-to-quarter throughout the year for the reasons I mentioned and really see ourselves as you look at, again, the scaling impact of the initiatives you mentioned, we're in early innings there. They vary. But I would say in macro, we're probably, on average, third, fourth inning in most of these, on average, both in terms of the sales benefit as well as the gross margin benefit.  So as these scale and as we work the other levers we've talked about, as we leverage our scale and as Todd mentioned, is we're in a very good place in price. We see ourselves in a very nice position to, over time, continue enhancing our gross margins. Operator : Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : John, I have a follow-up to that question. It's on overall margin or incremental margins. I think you spoke to gross. So this was embedded in the guidance, even when you issued it in the fourth quarter, that you have the step-up in incremental margin sequentially throughout the year. Sales get better. But if you look at the incremental against the sales, it's still an above average rate for what this business has done historically. So I heard some of the commentary that you just said within the gross and why that gets better, but it seems like cost pressures that were present 3 months ago may be getting worse, not better. And then how do you reconcile that versus accelerating incremental throughout the year? John Garratt : No. I wouldn't say we see cost pressures getting worse. We mentioned the cadence around the inflation. I would say the moderation is going to be more gradual than originally thought, but we still are seeing moderation. We still expect moderation, and that's why we see that sequential improvement in EPS and overall margins as we move through the year.  In terms of SG&A, we don't see any increased cost pressure there in terms of wage inflation. We've talked about that. We expect that growth in wage inflation to be well less than prior year, a little more than pre-pandemic levels but still manageable, and it's tracking where we expected there. We also mentioned making some targeted investments and specifically labor hours. It's really from a position of strength to continue driving the sales momentum to make sure we're good for the customer in terms of in-stock levels and customer experience but not a material step up there.  So we feel very good about the guidance we've provided, maintaining the full year EPS guidance despite enhanced, as everyone has called out, inflationary pressures. I think the team has done a great job mitigating those and improving the in-stocks in the right categories to be ready to drive the top line and the bottom line. Simeon Gutman : And Todd mentioned that there's some tightening that's happening, that the maybe trade down is starting to pick up steam. Are you willing to share was that built into your plan? Are you seeing it happen quicker than the way your plan was built? Todd Vasos : Yes. I would tell you that some of it was built in. We knew that the consumer was going to get tighter in 2022, just because of the lack of stimulus compared to last year. But I would tell you that because of other pressures, more inflation coming through on her everyday needs, as well as that fuel that I talked about, has quickened the pace a little bit. So we believe that she'll flee even further to value as she moves into the back half of the year. Especially as she gets to that holiday time frame, I believe that you'll see that. So we're very prepared for that.  The last thing I'll also mention that shows us that she is starting to move that way a little quicker is, one is she's coming more often in those basket, unit sizes are a little bit smaller. That's the true sign. And also the $1 price point that we are really pushing and getting behind has really accelerated as well, and we're seeing that. So that would tell you that she's trying to make ends meet, and we'll be there for her because that's what we do best. Operator : Our next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. John Heinbockel : Todd, maybe to start with, right, the business is in a far better place than it was in '08 and '09, right? We did extremely well. How does the recession playbook look differently than back then in terms of -- and how quickly do you play that? What do you have to see to want to lean into that playbook? Todd Vasos : Yes. John, it's a good question, and thanks for that. I would tell you that we're in a much different spot, not only economically, meaning the consumer is in a little different spot here. And I think the biggest piece is that her employment is still very healthy across all cohorts of customers that we serve. So I think that's one of the big differences here than '08, '09. Now could that roll over? We're watching that, very well could, which would then just quicken the pace, that flight to value. But we haven't seen that yet but because of the other inflationary pieces we have seen.  So there really isn't a lean-in in the playbook as much as it is knowing what that customer is going to do from historical times and then servicing I mentioned. And the reason we're leaning into that $1 price point is because we know how important that is during those times. Private brand, we've seen an acceleration in our private brand business as well in recent weeks. That's a true sign that she's starting to feel that pressure. So how do we respond? Well, you'll see more endcaps, more off-shelf displays of both $1 and private brand as we move through Q2 and then to the back half of the year. So we're really good and nimble, as you know, and to be able to move very quickly, so you'll see more and more of that. I think the important thing here is we're so different as a company than we were in '08, '09. I would hate to be fixing fundamentals right now because the opportunity to gain share is going to be tremendous as we, I believe, move through this year. And we're so far beyond that with all of the initiatives that we've put in place over the last 6, 7 years. It's nice to see that we're going to be in a position to take an oversized amount of share, we believe, as we move through the back half of the year. John Heinbockel : And then maybe secondly, right, on your -- the health and beauty assortment, maybe it's too early to tell. But when you look at those items in the basket or the people who are buying them, what are you seeing, right, in terms of frequency of shop, basket size, co-purchases? And that's typically a very loyal customer. Do you think that will drive more frequency? Is that the primary benefit you think you'll see? Jeffery Owen : John, this is Jeff, and thank you for that question. As we think about health, we've been saying this for quite some time, the largest share donor we're seeing in our business certainly is from the drug channel. And so that's one of the reasons, as you've heard us say before, why we're leaning in here. And so certainly, with 30% more selling space and 400 additional items, we're really pleased to be in 1,800 stores and be in 4,000 by the end of the year. And what we're seeing in the customer's response is very good, and we're excited about what we're seeing, not only in her take rates, but also when you break down the basket.  So when you think about Dollar General, I think the best way to think about this is this way. When you look at our mainstays, like home cleaning and paper where we have closer to a 10% share and when you think about this particular area where we're closer to a 4%, it really paints the opportunity for us to continue to grow share in this particular area. And as we've said before, we do classify this as consumable, but it has margins that are akin more to nonconsumable. And when you step back and you think about the larger footprint that we talk about, where 80% of our stores in 2022 will be in that larger 8,500 square foot footprint, it gives us the full theater to put this in place.  So I think you see from -- why we're so excited, but also, I think you see the intentional nature of how we layer this into our strategic view of the business and how we look forward and around the corner. So I think you'll see more to come there. We're really excited about what we see. Operator : Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I have 2 questions on the inflation front. So first, what are you seeing right now from a product cost inflation perspective? And then second, are you -- are there any challenges you're seeing right now in passing through some of the higher prices? Todd Vasos : Rupesh, it's Todd. Real quickly, obviously, we've seen what others have seen on that. We're in a little different spot, though, and our product mix is much different than the broader retail spectrum. So I would tell you that we're seeing, on average, a lot less cost pressure than what you would find in retail in general. That's number one.  The second piece is we have the ability here to trade off items and to trade down sizes, which we've been very active over the last 6, 8 months on when we saw inflation starting to move in a little different direction. So we've got the ability to do that. That's what we do best on our merch side, and so we've done a lot of that to also push off some of those costs to the consumer.  But as it relates to when we do have to put costs out there -- I'm sorry, additional retail to cover some of that CPG cost, we've been able to do that because we do it the Dollar General way, right? And we make sure that we can layer it in where the consumer still knows and sees the value of what we offer. And again, as I mentioned in my earlier comment, we haven't felt better about where we are. We're right in historical levels of our pricing index as compared to all classes of trade, so I believe we've got the ability to pass on where we need to, but more importantly, to help defray some of that pass-on to the consumer through our category management efforts, which, again, we're probably one of the best in the industry on. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. Just on your discretionary categories, just given many of the concerns out there, did anything differ versus your expectations during the quarter? I know weather did have an impact potentially on some of the categories but just curious if you've seen any changes in consumer behavior within those discretionary categories. Todd Vasos : Yes. As I mentioned also a little earlier, the consumer is becoming more and more intentional in her purchases. We've seen that, and what that means is taking care of her family a little bit more on the consumable side of the business, where she needs to make sure she buys; and then on that discretionary side, obviously, tightening the belt a little bit. So yes, we saw that. We knew that was going to occur, just because of the stimulus lap. But as I also mentioned, we saw it probably accelerate a little faster than where we thought it would as well.  But the great thing is the buying team has been all over this. So what we're already doing is as we see the -- with the third and fourth quarter and be able to still yet adjust, we're able to go in and adjust the products that we're selling on that discretionary side as well as making sure that the prices are right on that discretionary side, especially as we get to the important fourth quarter selling season. So we feel like we've seen where that consumer is probably going to land on a mix basis, discretionary versus non, but we also believe we've made the right trade-offs, and as John indicated, feel real good about our inventory levels there and not concerned at all at this point on any markdown risk that may be there. Operator : Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Katharine McShane : Our first question was just around the SNAP benefit, just how the SNAP composition has changed at DG over the last couple of quarters and what your projection is for the rest of the year. John Garratt : Yes. It continues to be elevated over pre-pandemic levels. The Thrifty Food Plan is still a benefit there. And while you have some states pulling out of the emergency waivers, it's been very gradual. And so it's still mixing quite a bit higher than norm, just not at the same peak level it was in the middle of last year, but doing very well there, continue to gain share with that customer and serve them very well. Katharine McShane : Question is just about traffic. Is there an expectation of when you think that can inflect positively? Todd Vasos : Yes. I would tell you that we actually closed out Q1 with a positive traffic number, which was really good to see. And as I indicated in my opening comments, like what we see on our start to Q2, and I think you can actually take from that, that our traffic number is looking much better than it was. So we feel as we get further and further away from that stimulus lap that John referred to, we believe we've got the right products, initiatives, price points, especially in this environment to drive that traffic long term. Operator : Our final question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Corey Tarlowe : Firstly, on international as it relates to Mexico, can you provide an update as to where you are on progress for expansion into that region? Jeffery Owen : Thanks, Corey. This is Jeff. So in Mexico, I'm really pleased with what the team has been able to accomplish in a relatively short period of time. I would tell you, we have assembled a fantastic team of retailers, and folks are really excited about joining the opportunity. So first and foremost, the team is incredibly impressive with decades of experience. That's the first point. The second point is, is that we continue to make great progress around learning how to serve this customer. And as we've mentioned before, we have a lot of analogs that gave us great confidence to even expand internationally from a lot of the performance and customers we serve along the border, which we've done historically incredibly well here at Dollar General.  So as we learn more and more about that consumer, we're really excited about what we are able to offer her and tailor it to her needs and also really rely a lot on what we've been able to do so well here in the United States. So feel great about the assortment and the build that we're doing there, feel real good about the supply chain progress and then also on the real estate. In fact, we've been down there a couple of weeks ago and headed down there here shortly to continue to look at the sites and been very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of our ability to be convenient and be that community-serving retailer that we are here in the U.S. and excited about what we're going to be able to do in Mexico. And we still feel real good about our initial expectation of up to 10 stores by the end of the year. Corey Tarlowe : That's great. And then just a follow-up question for John. As it relates to capital allocation, how are you thinking about the balance sheet and cash levels, balancing the dividend, close to $3 billion in share repurchases and then $1.5 billion in CapEx? John Garratt : Yes. We're still thinking about the same way in terms of the priorities. Our first priority remains investing in the business. When you can get these kind of returns on new stores and the kind of returns we're getting on our strategic initiative that positions us so well, that's where we're going to continue to invest first. Then it's paying a competitive dividend, which we increased 31% year-over-year on a quarterly basis. And then the business generates a tremendous amount of cash, which allows us to buy back shares. And as you mentioned, we're going to target $2.75 billion this year, so really meaningfully investing in the business, meaningfully returning cash to shareholders in these forms. And in terms of CapEx, with these kind of returns, we're going to invest what we need to. But again, I think with that amount, we're doing quite a bit with it. It is up a little bit as a percent of sales from historical norms. But the biggest piece of that is just steel inflation. And so if you strip that out, it's kind of back down to that historical level of a little over 3% of our sales. So feel really good about the allocation. It's working very well for us and I think working very well for the investors. Todd Vasos : Well, thank you for all the questions, and thanks for your interest in Dollar General. I'm proud of our team which continues to execute at a high level for our customers every day. I'm sure you can tell I'm more excited about this business than ever before. We are a mature retailer in growth mode, and our strategic focus has differentiated us in a discount retail landscape, particularly as we have transformed this company in the last few years. As a result, I believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on the enormous growth opportunities we see in front of us. Thank you for listening, and I hope you have a great day. Thank you.

Todd Vasos : Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our second quarter results, and I want to thank our associates for delivering another quarter of strong performance and for their dedication to serving our customers, communities and each other. The quarter was highlighted by comp sales growth of 4.6%, a slight increase in customer traffic, accelerated growth in market share of highly consumable product sales, including in both dollars and units, and double-digit growth in diluted EPS. Our Q2 performance was led by stronger-than-expected sales in our consumable category. This increase was partially offset by a decline in our combined non-consumable categories, which we believe reflects the evolving consumer demand during a period of inflation and economic uncertainty. During the quarter, and from a position of strength, we made targeted investments in both incremental labor hours and wages to further enhance the customer experience and build on our sales momentum. We believe these investments contributed to an improvement in our overall in-stock position and our strong sales results. And despite challenges from rising product cost inflation and ongoing supply chain pressures, our teams remain focused on controlling what we can control, while continuing to deliver value for our customers, which we believe is seen even more important in the current environment. To that end, we remain committed to offering products at the $1 or less price point, and we're pleased with the strong performance of this program during Q2, especially in the latter part of the quarter. Importantly, we continue to feel very good about our price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. And with more than 18,500 stores located within 5 miles about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current environment, while continuing, to support our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience. Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we look to strengthen our competitive position, while further distancing and differentiating Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape. Now let me recap some of the additional financial results for the second quarter. Net sales increased 9% to $9.4 billion, compared to net sales of $8.7 billion in Q2 of 2021. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales were lowest, but positive in May, with July being our strongest month of performance, and I'm pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q3. In fact, as a result of our first half outperformance and strong start to Q3, as well as our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our sales outlook for fiscal 2022, which John will discuss in more detail shortly. Our Q2 results included an increase in average basket size, largely driven by inflation, as we would expect during a more challenging economic environment. Average units per basket were down, while, as I mentioned earlier, customer traffic increased slightly. As the quarter progressed, we saw additional signs of our core customers shopping more intentionally and closer to need, as well as an increase in trade down activity. For example, during Q2, customers appeared to be making trade-offs of some of their food choices, contributing to an increase in private brand penetration within our consumables business. We also saw growth in the number of higher-income households shopping with us, which we believe reflects more consumers choosing Dollar General as they seek value. Collectively, we view our Q2 results as further validation that our strategic actions, which have transformed this company in recent years, positions us well for continued success, while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. We continue to operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And given our strong competitive position, further enhanced by our robust portfolio of short- and long-term initiatives, I have never felt better about the underlying business model or our future growth potential. With that said, I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jeff Owen, who will officially take over as CEO in November. No one understands and embodies our culture more than Jeff, and his contributions to our strategic direction over the years have been instrumental to our success. I've had the pleasure of working with Jeff for many years, and I'm confident he is the best and most capable person to lead the next phase of growth here at Dollar General. And finally, while Jeff will speak more to this later, I also want to congratulate John Garratt on his well-deserved promotion to President and CFO. With that, I will now turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. First, let me take a moment to thank Todd for his tremendous leadership and passion for our customers, our culture and this company. He has been a wonderful mentor and friend, and we wish him all the very best as he prepares to begin this new chapter. And let me also add my congratulations to Jeff, who I have known and worked closely with for several years. He is a highly respected leader throughout the organization, and we look forward to his leadership in the years ahead. Given Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me now take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. For Q2, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.3%, an increase of 69 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to higher inventory markups, partially offset by a higher LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from our consumables category, as well as increases in markdowns, transportation costs, distribution costs and damages. Of note, product cost inflation was greater than anticipated, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $144 million during the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.6%, an increase of 82 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail labor, repairs and maintenance, utilities and payroll taxes. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter increased 7.5% to $913 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.7%, a decrease of 13 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.1% and compares to 21.4% in the second quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted, EPS for the second quarter increased 10.8% to $2.98. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term, while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $6.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 31.4% overall and 25.1% on a per store basis. Similar to Q1, this increase primarily reflects the impact of product cost inflation, as well as a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in the home and seasonal categories as a result of the continued rollout of our nonconsumables initiative. And importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape. As Todd noted, we're also pleased with the improvements we saw in our in-stock levels during the quarter and expect continued improvement as we move through 2022, underscoring our optimism that we are well-positioned to better serve our customers in the back half of the year. Year-to-date through Q2, the business generated cash flows from operations totaling $948 million, a decrease of 28%. Total capital expenditures for the first half were $659 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $349 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $124 million. At the end of Q2, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1 billion. We announced today that our Board has increased this authorization by $2 billion. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. We continue to experience uncertainties with respect to product cost inflation, supply chain dynamics, the evolution of consumer spending throughout the year, and most recently, new store opening delays, which Jeff will discuss in more detail. Despite these challenges, we are confident in the business, and as Todd mentioned, we are increasing our sales outlook for 2022. For the full year, we now expect the following : net sales growth of approximately 11%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 2 percentage points from the 53rd week and same-store sales growth of approximately 4% to 4.5%. Additionally, we are reiterating the remainder of our financial guidance for 2022, which includes EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week, share repurchases of approximately $2.75 billion and capital spending in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Our EPS outlook also now assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 22.5%. Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of the quarterly cadence, we anticipate comp sales to be fairly consistent between Q3 and Q4, but EPS growth to be much higher in the fourth quarter, which includes the anticipated benefit from the 53rd week. In addition, we expect share repurchases in Q3 to be slightly higher than the Q2 amount before increasing more substantially in Q4, partially as a result of the extra week in our fourth quarter. Finally, as a result of an increase in interest rates and additional borrowings, we expect interest expense will be higher in the second half of the year. Turning now to gross margin for 2022. We expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI throughout the year. In addition, we are optimistic that distribution and transportation efficiencies, including continued expansion of our private fleet, will drive additional benefits despite anticipated and continued cost pressures in the near term. Offsetting some of these benefits is an expected continuation of sales mix pressure, as well as sales outperformance as our sales outperformance has been predominantly driven by growth in our consumables category, which generally has a lower gross profit rate than other product categories. With regards to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2022 as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. We also continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track, and we believe these savings in 2022 will continue to offset a portion of expected wage inflation. Finally, and consistent with Q2, our outlook includes continued investments to further enhance the customer experience, including incremental labor hours and wages to drive continued improvement in overall in-stock levels and customer service. In summary, we are proud of our team's hard work and commitment to execution, which has resulted in our strong second quarter results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thank you, John. Let me take a moment to express my appreciation for all Todd has done for this company throughout his 14-year career. He's led us through a transformational period and has positioned us extremely well for the future. On behalf of the entire Dollar General team, we want to sincerely thank him for the impact he has made on our business. I am fortunate to have been able to learn from him, and I look forward to his ongoing counsel. And as Todd noted, we are excited to announce that John has been promoted to President, while continuing to serve as CFO. John has made many significant contributions to Dollar General during his time leading our finance and corporate strategy teams, and I look forward to his continued leadership and partnership as he steps into this new role. Finally, let me also say how humbled and privileged I am by the opportunity to serve this great team as the next CEO of Dollar General. I couldn't be more excited about our future and all that we can accomplish together. Now let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to create opportunities for meaningful growth. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We continue to make progress executing against our robust portfolio of initiatives. Let me take you through some of the recent highlights. Starting with our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI, which was available in nearly 15,000 stores at the end of the second quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across our NCI store base. This treasure hunt offering continues to resonate with value-seeking customers as approximately 80% of the assortment is priced at $5 or less. We expect to realize ongoing sales and margin benefits from NCI in 2022, and are on track to complete the rollout across nearly the entire chain by the end of the year. Moving to our pOpshelf store concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 14 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 80, located within 8 states. Additionally, we opened 7 new store-within-a-store concept during the second quarter. This brings the total number of Dollar General market stores, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf store to a total of 32 at the end of the quarter. We plan to nearly triple the pOpshelf store count this year, and now expect to open a total of 15 store-within-a-store concepts, which would bring us to about 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations and approximately 40 store-within-a-store concepts by year-end. Over the long term, we anticipate year 1 annualized sales volumes for these stores to be between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, and expect the average gross margin rate to exceed 40%. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the results of this unique and differentiated concept, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 pOpshelf locations by year-end 2025. Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods, along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in 2021, and are now delivering to nearly 19,000 stores from 12 facilities. The initial objective of DG Fresh was to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in frozen and refrigerated categories. We are also pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department, which had our strongest rate of comp sales growth during the first half of the year. Looking ahead, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. And while produce was not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. Notably, at the end of Q2, we offered produce in more than 2,700 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 3,000 stores by the end of 2022. Finally, as I previously mentioned, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. During Q2, we added over 17,000 cooler doors across our store base, and we are on track to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2022. Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have significant opportunity to drive additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead. Turning now to an update on our health initiative, branded as DG Wellbeing. The initial focus of this project is an expanded health offering, which consists of approximately 30% more feet of selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in approximately 2,700 stores at the end of Q2, and we are on track to expand to a total of more than 4,000 stores by the end of 2022. During the quarter, we announced the establishment of a new Healthcare Advisory Panel, which recently convened its first quarterly meeting. The panel is composed of highly regarded health care industry subject matter experts who will serve as thought partners to our team, including advising on how best to invest resources to better serve our customers in the health and wellness space. Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering, with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time, particularly in rural America. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink reduction. To that end, we recently announced plans to significantly increase our supply chain capacity by building 3 new distribution centers in North Little Rock, Arkansas; Aurora, Colorado; and Salem, Oregon. Each facility will be approximately 1 million square feet and supported in part by our growing private fleet. We expect to begin construction on the Arkansas and Oregon facilities this fall, with both of which will be combo traditional and fresh distribution centers. We have already begun construction on the Colorado facility, which will be a traditional dry goods distribution center. We are excited about these new projects, which we expect will add more than 1,000 new jobs supporting our ongoing store growth and drive additional efficiencies in our supply chain. Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In the second quarter, we completed a total of 790 real estate projects, including 227 new stores, 533 remodels and 30 relocations. For 2022, we are updating our real estate plans to reflect adjustments made primarily in response to ongoing delays related to permitting and the receipt of construction materials associated with the new store openings. For 2022, we now plan to execute in the range of 2,930 to 2,980 real estate projects in total, including 1,010 to 1,060 new stores, approximately 1,795 remodels and about 125 store relocations. We continue to expect approximately 80% of our new Dollar General stores in 2022 to be in our larger 8,500 square foot store format, which allows us for an even greater assortment as we look to serve our customers with products they want and need. Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the unit economics of this larger format, highlighted by increased sales productivity, and we continue to target returns in the range of 20% to 22%. In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth in 2022, we are very excited about our plans to expand internationally, and we continue to make good progress towards our goal of opening our first stores in Mexico by the end of 2022. I am pleased to announce that these stores will be branded under the name [ The Super ] Dollar General, which resonated well with customer focus groups and connotes the idea of a local general store focused on serving customers with products they want and need most. In addition, the initial stores will be located in underserved communities in Northern Mexico as we look to initially leverage our brand awareness, while extending our value and convenience proposition to a customer base that is similar to our core customer in the United States. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust. And with more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around creating a digital front porch to our stores as we look to create deeper and more meaningful connections with our customers. We ended Q2 with nearly 4.5 million monthly active users on the digital app and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. Our partnership with DoorDash continues to resonate with both new and existing customers as we look to extend the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery and an hour or less. This offering was available in more than 13,300 stores at the end of Q2, and we continue to be very pleased with the results, including sales above our initial expectations for the first half of the year. In addition, we are also excited about the continued growth of our DG Media Network. We are seeing significant interest in participation from CPG companies and brands who are seeking to connect with the more than 80 million unique customer profiles, especially our rural customers, who represent about 30% of the country and allude the reach of other retail media networks. As a result, we are enabling advertisers to both digitally and physically build awareness and drive purchase consideration, while positioning Dollar General as a retailer of choice for customers seeking many of America's most trusted brands. After establishing the foundation over the last few years, we are beginning to meaningfully grow this business, as we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners, while increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business. Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, and we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our current goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores and enhancing customer convenience. The first phase of Fast Track consisted of both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which has led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in approximately 10,000 stores at the end of Q2, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates. We are also excited about our pilot in select stores, which provides customers the option to utilize self-checkout in all lanes, but also choose a staffed register preferred. We believe this full self-checkout option could further enhance our convenience proposition, while enabling store teams to dedicate even more time to serving customers. We plan to ultimately test this layout in about 200 stores by the end of this year. Looking ahead, we are on track to expand our self-checkout offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of the year as we look to further extend our position as an innovative retail and small box discount retail. Moving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consists of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will drive greater efficiencies for our retail leaders and their teams. Our efforts to reduce costs have also benefited from our growing private fleet, which consisted of more than 1,100 tractors at the end of Q2. As a reminder, we are focused on significantly expanding our private fleet in 2022 as we plan to more than double the number of tractors from 2021, which we expect will account for approximately 40% of our outbound transportation fleet by the end of the year. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for personal and professional development, and ultimately, career advancement. To that end, we are very pleased with our DG Discover Hiring event in Q2, which exceeded our goal for new hires, while adding significant talent to our teams in the field, distribution centers and private fleet. With regards to development, our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by internal placement rates of more than 75% at or above the lead sales associate position. Additionally, approximately 15% of our private fleet began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. We also continue to be pleased with our turnover rates, staffing levels and applicant flow, further validating our belief that we are taking the right actions to attract and retain talent. Ultimately, we believe that the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. We also held our annual leadership meeting earlier this month in Nashville, providing an important collaboration and development experience for more than 1,500 leaders of our company. This event is a high point for me every year, and I am always inspired by the incredible talent of our people and humbled by the way they live out their personal purpose, while fulfilling our mission to serve others. In closing, I am proud of the team's strong performance as we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, while creating meaningful value for our shareholders. I want to thank our approximately 173,000 employees for their work every day to make a difference in the lives of our customers, especially at times like this when they need us the most. I am excited about all that we will accomplish together in the second half of 2022 and beyond. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So first, Todd, congrats on all the success over the years. And Jeff and John, congrats on your well-deserved promotions. John Garratt : Thank you. Jeffery Owen : Thank you. Rupesh Parikh : So I was hoping to first touch just on your price position. So how do you feel about your pricing position today in light of some of the competitive actions that are taking place right now and are expected to happen going forward? Todd Vasos : Yes. Rupesh, this is Todd. I'll take that one. We feel great about our price position. I just want to remind everybody, well over a year ago, we took a very aggressive price stance, as you may recall me talking about over the last 18 months or so. And it positions us so well in the pandemic and now exiting the pandemic time frame. And we feel great about where we are on prices against all classes of trade, and of course, against even our chief competitors, we're in really good shape. And obviously, as we continue to move forward with this environment, we'll continue to look at how we service our customer. The fabulous thing is we're in a great position, and our customers are really showing through our increase in trips that we saw for the quarter that they rely on our everyday low price here at Dollar General always first before anything else. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then my 1 follow-up question, maybe for John. So there was pretty significant deleverage on more than 4% comp. So anything unusual to happen in Q2 that doesn't repeat for the back half of the year? And then just any more color in terms of how to think about SG&A for the back half. John Garratt : Thanks, Rupesh. As you look at SG&A, nothing unusual there. One thing we had talked about was from a position of strength and given the sales outperformance and momentum that we were going to be making targeted proactive investments to build on that momentum, to help drive sales, as well as an enhanced customer experience. So really, it was consistent with that. The most notable one was adding some labor hours to help further improve our in-stock levels as well as that customer service. We really like what we're seeing there. Also, to a lesser extent, we did make targeted investments in wages in the physical box itself. But I would say more normal course proactive actions to drive the business. We also did see some inflation on utilities and did have some higher-than-normal R&M expenses associated with the weather. But I think when you look at just overall operating margin, we feel really good about what we're doing. We feel great about the gross margin expansion. A lot of the investments we make in SG&A really drives that gross margin expansion, which was up 69 basis for the quarter, and importantly, 1.5 points above where we were 3 years ago. So we really like to look at operating profit overall because, as we said before, the geography and the leverage changes a little bit as we spend a little bit on SG&A to drive more on gross margin as you look at the implied guidance with the sales and the strong bottom line guide for the year, that implies operating margin expansion over the back half. So we feel well positioned that we're making the right trade-offs and investments to drive that sales growth. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on another great quarter, guys. So first, could you just speak to the top line acceleration that you're seeing despite the tougher backdrop for low-income households that, I think, broadly, we're seeing. How best to think about the inflection back to positive traffic that you saw this quarter? And what are you seeing from retention of new customers that you've recently acquired? Todd Vasos : Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. Yes, I would tell you that as expected, the customer is reacting just like we thought she would. And that is she's shopping closer to need. She's being very intentional in her shopping patterns, as well as her shopping while she's inside the 4 walls of the Dollar General store. It is a little bit more skewed to need based, which we thought would also occur. But the great thing is what we're seeing is that if we do have the right product out there, which we do, on the discretionary side, she's shopping that as well. As an example, our harvest in Halloween is off to a fabulous start, well over what we expected. So again, you got to have the right items at the right value, and that's what Dollar General is all about as you know. With that more intentional shopping, we also see her buying more private brands. So our private brand sales have continued to increase quarter-over-quarter as well as year-over-year. And so we're seeing that. And then the all-important $1 price point. By the way, the $1 price point was one of, if not, the fastest-growing subcategory we had here at Dollar General in Q2. And we're seeing that it is so much more important for her today than ever before to be able to feed her family toward the end of the month. So we're definitely leaning in both in private brand and the $1 price point. You may remember, I mentioned a couple of quarters ago, that we anticipated this, so we started to bring in more of this type of product, as well as our merchants under Emily Taylor and her group to really highlight that in off-shelf displays, end caps and that has been ongoing. And we'll continue to press forward on that as we move to the back half of the year because, again, we believe that $1 price point will be very, very important. And then lastly, just like we thought, again, trips being up, so she's coming more often, but spending less on each trip. And again, that's a reversal to what we saw there in the pandemic. So she's really coming back to where we suspected she would. But the great thing about Dollar General is our price is fabulous. Our price position, as I mentioned earlier, couldn't be better, and she's showing it within those trips that she's bringing to Dollar General. So more to come as we move through the back half of this year and into '23. But I would tell you, I've never felt better about our positioning as we are here to help that customer through probably the toughest time she's seen in quite a while. Matthew Boss : That's great. And then maybe, John, on gross margin. How best to think about the components in the back half if we're thinking about mark on LIFO or mix? And then just larger picture, holding the earnings guide today despite the better sales outlook, so is this solely the targeted investments that you cited that's holding back incremental model flow through? John Garratt : Sure. I'll start with gross margin. We didn't give specific guidance on gross margin. But to give you some color around the puts and the takes, we do expect to continue to see mixed pressure over the course of the remainder of the year as sales outperformance exceeds -- on consumables, exceeds nonconsumables, as everybody is seeing. And we also do expect to see ongoing supply chain pressures, including higher fuel costs, as well as increased product cost inflation. So we expect that to continue. But I would tell you, on the transportation side and supply chain in general, we are seeing moderation there, and we do get an easier lap in the back half as we lap pretty substantial and growing supply chain inflation last year. And we're doing a lot of good things to help mitigate that. As Jeff mentioned in the prepared comments, doubling the size of the private fleet, really has a meaningful impact on that where we save about 20% on a per driver basis there. The other thing we called out was markdowns, but I would tell you, with the markdowns, that's really a function of normalization. We were lapping unusually low clearance markdowns and promotional markdowns last year. If you look at where we're at now, still well below pre-pandemic levels, but that lap will continue to be a bit of a pressure to us. But as we look at the back half of the year, in addition to the easing inflationary pressures, particularly on the supply chain and some other areas and the actions we're taking, we're continuing to see growing benefits from our strategic initiatives, which go after the top line and the bottom line other actions to help mitigate that. And as I mentioned previously, when you look at operating margin overall, it suggests expansion in the back half given all the actions we're taking. So -- and as we look ahead, I think we're very well positioned to continue to expand our gross margin over the long term. Todd talked about being in a great spot on price position. And again, as a limited SKU operator with our growth in size, I think it really positions us well in this environment to serve that customer very well. Be sharp on price, but to continue to expand our margins over the long term. And in terms of the question around why not raise EPS guidance, I would say that, first, very pleased based on the strength of the first half of the year and the anticipated results in the back half to raise the sales guidance, and pleased to reiterate the strong EPS guidance, while others have had to lower it in this challenging environment. We see the business fundamentals is very strong. It positions us very well to continue to be double-digit EPS growers over the long term, which we were at 10.8% this quarter. But there are some near-term headwinds. We mentioned the ongoing mix pressure. The overperformance in sales has been on the consumables side, which has lower margins. And while we do expect some moderation in inflation in the near term, it remains pressured with elevated supply chain costs, fuel costs and product cost inflation, of course, the LIFO charge, which continues throughout the year as that's spread over the year. Also another piece which you mentioned is the SG&A investment, which I talked about. I wouldn't say that's the only driver, the primary driver. But that is a driver to that. But again, we like what we're seeing there in terms of the investment in labor hours to help drive a better customer experience, to help drive sales and we are investing, as I mentioned, a little bit in targeted investments in wages in the box itself. And then the other thing we called out was interest. Interest will be higher in the back half of the year given higher interest rates and higher borrowings. So a number of near-term tailwinds, but we feel really good to be able to maintain that guidance, continue to see ourselves as double-digit EPS growers over the long term. And there's a lot of year left, but feel good about the guidance we've provided. Matthew Boss : Congrats again, best of luck. Operator : Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Probing a bit on the sales guidance for the back half, I recognize that the 1-year comp is guided to accelerate. If we look at the 3-year stack, it looks like Q2 accelerated quite a bit and that the second half actually doesn't imply much of an acceleration. So curious given the trade down and, I guess, where the customer is going, seems to benefit you right now. Any assumptions other than conservatism that you're thinking about in terms of sales for the second half? John Garratt : Yes. As you look at sales in the second half, I mean, when you do the squeeze on that, that's quite healthy sales, not only on a 3-year basis, but as you look at the 1-year basis. To your point, we did see accelerating comps, we saw accelerating comps throughout the quarter. So we feel really good about the momentum of the business going in. We feel really good about the new customers and basket size growth that we've been able to retain coming out of the pandemic. And we are starting to see signs of more customer trade down, that's contemplated in the guidance. I wouldn't say we have a significant impact from that built into the guidance. But based on what we're seeing, that is contemplated in there. We're seeing a bigger impact, as big as ever impact from our real estate with the strong performance of remodels and new units, which are exceeding our pro forma, and the initiatives are delivering. So we feel really good about where we're at, the momentum of the business, the fundamentals, and I think the guidance reflects that, as well as a little bit in there contemplated around that trade down. Simeon Gutman : And maybe the follow-up, just honing on the gross margin a bit. Q2 was quite good and at a structurally higher level. Can you talk about the sustainability of this? And if there was some -- maybe some puts in and takes, but it feels like we're run rating at a higher level, and not thinking about guidance into '23, but are the drivers actually accelerating? You mentioned some relief on input costs. Are the drivers accelerating such that this is only going to build from here? John Garratt : Yes. Again, I don't want to get too specific around gross margin guidance. But again, as you do the squeeze in the back half, it implies healthy, positive operating margin expansion and gross margin. We feel good about where we're at here in terms of sustainability over the long term to drive that. The biggest driver when you look, again, you go back to pre-pandemic levels where we're up 1.5 points in this quarter. It's the initiative is a huge piece of that. The ongoing benefit of DG Fresh and NCI, as we optimize and scale those, that's the gift that keeps on giving other things around the DG Media Network, just while promotional activity was a little bit higher versus pandemic where there was none. We remain very targeted in that and are doing a great job minimizing the clearance activity. So I think as you think the fundamental drivers of the initiatives, as you think about the other levers we've talked about, the efficiencies we're driving in supply chain, including the private fleet and the other levers we've talked about. And we do see spots where the inflation is starting to moderate, particularly around carrier rates ocean freight, we're seeing moderation there. It remains to be seen what happens to inflation overall with vendors, but we'd expect over time that growth, that pace of increases to start to moderate as well. And again, as you get to the back half of the year, we're lapping pretty substantial increasing supply chain inflationary laps. And so as we see some moderation and get easing laps, that will help as well. And that's all contemplated in the guide. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Todd, Jeff and John, congratulations on all your new endeavors. My first question is the success of Dollar General over many years has been driven by not only a superior execution and formal strategy, but also some of its competitors in the small-box value retail space being on a long journey to try and find their way. And now there could be some changes in the competitive environment. We're seeing Family Dollar make price investments, it could be the perception that you're making investments in store hours, store labor as another way to beef up in the event that you are now going to face a stronger competitor, so the net result of all this could mean that the profit rate, the operating profit rate in small box retail has peaked as now 2 competitors that are going to be stronger and well positioned, are fighting a little bit harder against each other. Why or why not is that the case? Todd Vasos : I'll start it out, Michael. I would tell you that obviously, you're zeroing in on our chief competitor there. So I'll just say this that it's been not only a long journey for them, I would say it's been even tougher than that. We've heard over the last 7 years that they're getting traction and they're doing this and doing that, and we're still talking about that. So I think we're still talking about it. What we are here to do, as you know us pretty well, Michael, is controlling what we can control and forging ahead on our initiatives. We have left our chief competitor completely in the dust that will take years, years to catch up. And I would also tell you that we feel very, very strongly that peak margins haven't yet been obtained and that we have a lot of room to grow. You've heard from John, not only short term but long term. Our initiatives alone are driving a tremendous amount of that growth and that confidence. And I would tell you that Jeff and the team, as we go forward, have got a lot of initiatives in the hopper that we haven't even talked about yet that are percolating. So we're looking out as we promised everyone 6 years ago, when we started the strategic journey that we've been on, that we would look out 5 to 10 years down the road and around the corner. And I think you've seen from us that we've done that. And I think you've seen the fruits of that as we continue to roll out these initiatives. And to your point, have some of the best execution in the retail industry against initiatives. Lastly, being here for 14 years and thinking back to the last time we had the recession and we had the customer that was really strained, the 1 thing that Dollar General had is that we had already fixed a lot of the basic railroad by the time we really hit stride in late '09 and '10. I would hate to be trying to fix the railroad right now. It would be like one of the toughest times to do it. And so I would like to just point out that we're in such a great position that as we continue to move forward, we believe we'll be able to capitalize on that trade down that we're already seeing. And that trade down is coming from income levels that are upwards of $100,000 which we really are encouraged in seeing a younger consumer, a little bit more affluent, and again, very digitally and tech savvy. Michael Lasser : Super helpful. My follow-up question is on the outlook for this trade down. Your comp in the quarter was obviously well above your algorithm, you're guiding conservatively for the back half of the year seemingly so. You have a lot of inventory. Why wouldn't this above algorithm comp continue well into next year, assuming that the macro environment stays where it is, and if it gets a little worse that trade-down benefit will be even greater? Todd Vasos : Yes. So I would tell you that I will first start and just say that we feel that, that trade down will continue to come in and benefit us. As it relates to the inventory levels, we couldn't be happier with where we sit today on inventory. We did all the right things early on, Michael, as you would imagine, coming from a Dollar General. We were well ahead of any inventory issues that may pop up unlike some of our competitors out there. We canceled orders as early as December because we saw where the customer was headed. We actually have canceled orders not only into Q2, but into the back half of the year. And all of our guidance is contemplated on that. So we feel very strong. The quality of our inventory couldn't be better. And as we move forward, we believe that will benefit us as we move into the back half of this year and into next year. Operator : Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Katharine McShane : I just wanted to go back on the trade down commentary. If there are certain categories being sought out by the higher-end consumer. And what categories are you seeing heavier trade down to with regards to private label? And then just as a follow-up, with the higher-end consumer coming into the store now, how long do they traditionally stick around and how might you be trying to keep them as more permanent customers? Todd Vasos : I would tell you, what we're seeing on that higher-end consumer is that she does shop a more holistic part of the store. And I made mention on the harvest and Halloween as an example, very discretionary, but doing extremely well. And some of that comes from that trade down, right? Because that consumer does have a little bit more money to spend. And as you think about how sticky that customer is, well, dial the clock back just a bit to the pandemic and now coming out of the pandemic, we've retained a lot more of those customers than we thought we would. So we're very happy on that retention. So we know that they're sticky because, again, that consumer -- was that consumer making -- the majority of them making that 50 to 75 range. So this one extends up to 100. But again, the experience is very, very similar to those, for those consumers when they come in. So we believe that, that will be sticky as well. So when you think about our market share in just discretionary items. I also want to point out that, that was positive as well for the quarter. So we're picking up share even in a very tough environment on the discretionary side. And then lastly, your other question was around what type of items are we seeing as well. Even from our core customer, trading down -- trade down doesn't always mean just trading down from other retailers. It also is trading down when you get inside the box, and our core customer has been buying more private brands, that $1 price point, very, very important to her. If you think about things that have accelerated greatly over the last quarter, if you think of basic proteins that our core customer needs, so what we've seen is 15% to 20% increases over the last couple of quarters in canned meat, seafood, dry pasta, soups, rice and beans. So those core proteins, eggs, all those things that the consumer needs to feed her family but can do it at a much reduced price. So we're seeing that trade down effect as well, and we're in great position to take advantage of that, both from our everyday low retail price stance, as well as our supply chain is much more healthier there than we were last year at this time. Operator : Our next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. John Heinbockel : Congratulations. Todd, I wonder if you can talk to, you referenced this strategic journey, which is one of the most significant things I think you brought in. Where are we on that in terms of the pipeline of things? Well, First of all, I think you're looking out, right, 2 or 3 years with that effort. Where is the pipeline versus where it's been historically, right? Is it fuller? And then where do you think -- you're not going to talk specifics, but when you think about kind of functional areas, right, merchandising, marketing, where do you think there's the most fertile ground, right, to use those strategic ideas to further the DG brand? Todd Vasos : Yes. Let me start, and I'm going to turn it over to Jeff as well. But I would tell you that, John, we feel great about those strategic initiatives. And to your point, not only a couple of years out, but 5 and 10 years out is the look. And if you look at the majority of them, there -- for instance, NCI, as an example, while we're close to the end of that rollout journey, the next phase of that, that optimization phase, is just starting. I would tell you, we're probably in the fifth inning in NCI. We're in the late fourth inning in the fresh piece of the business, with produce being a big unlock yet to come as an example. And then we're just starting the journey. We're just getting up to the plate to use the analogy in both Mexico and in our health initiative. And as I mentioned earlier, we've got others we haven't even talked about ready to push into the pipeline. And Jeff, you may want to jump in just briefly. Jeffery Owen : Yes. I would tell you, John, thank you for the question. And I think, we've never been more excited about the future. And to Todd's point earlier, it's not 2 to 3 years out. I mean, one of the things you got to think about is our, first of all, our pipeline for growth. I mean, that 17,000 additional opportunities, 13,000 general stores, 3,000 pOpshelf stores and 1,000 DGX. So First and foremost, our pipeline is extremely robust, and we're very pleased with this larger store format that we've been rolling out. 80% of our stores this year will be in that larger store format, and we're seeing the sales per square foot perform extremely well. So we're very pleased at how our new store performance is beating our pro forma expectations. And John, you've followed us for quite some time. We have pretty high expectations for our new store growth program. But as you think to the future also, you got to think about digital as well. I mean, our digital strategy and our acceleration there is serving us tremendously well. I mean, when you think about over 80 million profiles that we're able to connect with our CPG firms and our brand partners, and we believe we can expand that beyond traditional CPG and brand partners because we have a unique customer, almost 30% of the United States population in rural America, that's really hard to reach. And with our customer profiles, we're able to really connect multiple partners with that unique Dollar General customer that no one knows better than we do. But as you think down the road, Mexico, we're excited to open stores, and we said this before, we wouldn't be going to Mexico if we didn't think it was a huge opportunity. And then when you think about health, health is one of these where we're -- we just had our first meeting with our advisory panel. It was incredible. And you're going to hear a lot more about health here in the near term and in the future with our Chief Medical Officer, Albert Wu, his strategy and the way we're going to be able to provide access for a customer that's being underserved right now. So when you think down the road, it's extremely bright. And I would tell you, your comment about our teams, where do we have fertile ground? We have the best team in retail. And so when you look at every aspect of this Dollar General team, it's the unique and secret sauce of our success. And our culture has never been stronger. Our teams are energized to continue to move forward. So I think you can tell from my excitement, Todd's excitement, John's, that we see tremendous opportunity in the future. And I can't wait to update you guys in the near future on where we're going. Operator : Our next question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Corey Tarlowe : Congrats to Todd on a successful career with Dollar General, and to Jeff and John for your new elevated roles. So first, there was an announcement intra-quarter about the 3 DC openings out west. Are we to read into that, that there are perhaps the more incremental store opportunity ahead lies in the regions where those new DCs are, in fact, being built out west in the U.S.? Jeffery Owen : Corey, thank you for the question, and thank you for the well wishes. One of the things we do so well here at Dollar General is we anticipate and look down the road. And we like to think we look around the corner real well, too. So that's exactly what this is. Our distribution strategy is in lockstep, as I mentioned just a minute ago. We have 17,000 additional opportunities, and that's across the entire U.S. And so we're very pleased at our ability to expand our distribution network because what it's going to do for us is it's going to continue to allow us to serve our stores better, make it more efficient, be able to pull cost out of the system and enable us to continue to grow. And as you can tell, we have significant growth prospects in the future. And that's all this is, is being able to make sure that our distribution is in line with our store opening plans, and those 2 teams work very, very well together to plan accordingly. Corey Tarlowe : Great. And then just a follow-up for John. How are you thinking about your expectations for freight expenses throughout the back half of this year within the overall margin guidance that you've given? John Garratt : Yes. As we touched on earlier, we do see improving conditions there. You're seeing additional supply capacity come online. You're seeing, obviously, demand drop as folks cut orders. And so when you look at both ocean freight and you look at domestic carrier rates, we're seeing those rates come down. And again, actions we're taking like with the private fleet is helping mitigate that as well. And we're coming up on a time where you're lapping increasing supply chain costs as you went from Q3 into Q4 last year. So I think net-net, we're doing a great job mitigating it. And I think that will, over time, switch to a tailwind as we see that moderate. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Todd Vasos for closing comments. Todd Vasos : Yes. Thank you for all the questions, and thanks for your interest in Dollar General. And I do appreciate all the well wishes that you extended. Serving what this team has been the highlight of my professional career, and it's been a blessing and a privilege to serve our customers, associates, shareholders and communities over the past 7-plus years as the CEO of Dollar General. I'm extremely proud of the progress we've made together, and look forward to working with Jeff and the team in an advisory and consulting capacity going forward, as well as continue to serve on the board. I believe we have the best team in retail, our mission and culture are stronger than ever and we are extremely well-positioned to capitalize on the enormous growth opportunities we see ahead. Again, thank you for listening, and I hope you have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

Jeffery Owen : Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our entire team for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers, communities and each other.  The quarter was highlighted by strong performance on the top line, led by comp sales growth of 6.8% and included increases in traffic and in market share of both consumable and nonconsumable product sales.  During the quarter, we experienced significantly higher-than-anticipated cost pressures, including challenges within our internal supply chain, sales mix pressures and higher inventory damages and shrink, all of which impacted gross margin. We will elaborate more on these cost pressures in a bit.  But despite these challenges, we delivered a double-digit increase in diluted earnings per share, along with strong same-store sales growth. As the economic environment continued to evolve during the quarter, we remain focused on serving the needs of our core customer.  We continue to see customer behaviors in Q3 that we believe indicate they are feeling increased financial pressure, including reductions in the number of items purchased per basket and in discretionary spending, which was softer than anticipated during the quarter.  Customers also continued to shift spending to more affordable options, such as items that are dollar price point and private brands, while also shopping closer to payday at the first of the month. Importantly, we are growing more productive with our core customer as well as seeing an increase in customers with annual household incomes up to $100,000.  This growth underscores our belief that our value and convenience proposition resonates with a broad spectrum of customers and will continue to be important to all customers in this challenging economic environment. In turn, we remain focused on delivering value and convenience and continue to feel good about our pricing position relative to competitors and other classes of trade.  Further, we remain committed to offering products at the $1 price point, and we're pleased with the strong comp sales performance of these products during Q3, as they collectively outperformed the chain average. With nearly 19,000 stores, located within 5 miles of about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to support our customers even in a challenging economic environment.  We're building on this foundation, I'm excited to share our real estate growth plans for next year. In fiscal 2023, we plan to execute approximately 3,170 projects in the United States including 1,050 new store openings as we continue to lay and strengthen the foundation for future growth. I'll share more details on these plans in just a few minutes, along with an update on our plans for our supply chain as we continue to support our significant growth.  But first, let me recap some additional financial results for the third quarter. Our strong comp sales performance helped drive a net sales increase of 11.1% to $9.5 billion. From a monthly cadence perspective, the comp sales momentum we saw building in Q2 continued into all 3 months of Q3, with September being our strongest month of performance. And I'm pleased to note that Q4 sales are off to a strong start as well.  Our Q3 comp sales were primarily driven by an increase in average transaction amount, largely driven by inflation. And as we would expect during a more challenging economic environment, average units per basket were down.  As I mentioned earlier, we were excited to see a second consecutive quarter of increasing customer traffic contribute to the growth. With regards to the supply chain cost pressures I mentioned earlier, I want to touch on what happened and the actions we have taken to address these challenges. As a reminder, since the early days of the pandemic over 2 years ago, we have seen demand and sales grow at a robust pace.  In addition, the overall mix of products we are shipping has evolved significantly with the growth of our nonconsumable initiative in pOpshelf. As our distribution needs grew and evolved, we strategically designed permanent warehouse capacity solutions to support our growth.  We plan for them to be operational starting in the back half of this year while making greater use of temporary storage facilities in the near-term. However, as we move through Q3, we experienced unexpected delays in opening additional temporary storage facilities, primarily due to external challenges such as permitting. At the same time, seasonal goods came in earlier than anticipated. The resulting constraints from these factors led to more than $40 million and additional supply chain costs in Q3 compared to what we had previously expected.  These costs included retention fees incurred for delays in returning shipping containers. Costs associated with inefficiencies in moving freight within our distribution centers and higher transportation costs as a result of servicing stores from less-than-optimal distribution center alignments.  While these issues have resulted in a gross margin headwind in the back half of this year, the team has worked hard to move past these delays with the opening of additional storage and warehouse facilities, which have already begun to relieve some of the capacity pressures. In fact, within the past few weeks, we increased capacity by more than 2 million square feet with the opening of 2 new permanent regional distribution hubs in Georgia and Texas, which will serve as intermediary facilities between import points and the rest of our distribution centers.  With the opening of both the temporary and permanent facilities, we believe we are well positioned to drive continued improvement as we move ahead, as we better optimize store alignment with distribution centers, lower capacity utilization within our existing footprint and improve the overall flow of goods.  Of note, these regional hubs will be followed by the opening of our new combination distribution center in Nebraska, which is scheduled to begin shipping by the end of this fiscal year. In addition, our previously announced facilities in Arkansas, Colorado and Oregon are expected to come online over the next 18 months.  Collectively, all of these new distribution centers will ultimately result in a more than 20% increase in total capacity and position us well to support continued growth in the years to come. Overall, while internal supply chain challenges have impacted our EPS outlook for 2022, we believe the significant growth in demand that contributed to these challenges is a testament to the growing relevance of Dollar General. And we are confident in our plans to support this growth going forward.  Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives from a position of strength, as we continue to distance and differentiate Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape.  We continue to operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And as a mature retailer in growth mode, our transformational strategic actions have positioned us well for continued success, while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. With that, I will turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Now that Jeff has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details, beginning with gross profit.  Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.  For Q3, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.5%, a decrease of 27 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to a higher LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumable category as well as increases in distribution costs, markdowns, inventory shrink and damages partially offset by higher inventory markups.  Of note, product cost inflation was greater than anticipated, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $148 million during the quarter. And while we believe cost increases are beginning to moderate, we anticipate LIFO will continue to pressure Q4 as well.  SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.7%, a decrease of 23 basis points. This decrease was driven by expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail labor, incentive compensation, hurricane-related disaster expenses and occupancy costs. These were partially offset by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales, including utilities, repairs and maintenance and travel and training costs.  Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter increased 10.5% to $736 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 7.8%, a decrease of 4 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.8% and compares to 22.2% in the third quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the third quarter increased 12% to $2.33.  Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long-term, while delivering significant returns to shareholders.  Merchandise inventories were $7.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 34.8% overall and 28.4% on a per store basis.  Similar to the first half of the year, this increase primarily reflects the impact of product cost inflation, a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in the home and seasonal categories, primarily due to the continued rollout of our non-consumables' initiative, and the early receipt of seasonal goods.  Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape, and we anticipate that we will begin to see lower levels of inventory growth beginning in Q4. Moving down the balance sheet. We issued $2.3 billion of senior notes during Q3, and we now expect to incur total interest expense of approximately $210 million for the full year, an increase of approximately $53 million over the prior year.  Turning to cash flow. Year-to-date through Q3, the business generated cash flows from operations totaling $1.2 billion, a decrease of 44%, primarily due to higher inventory purchases.  Total capital expenditures through Q3 were $1.1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to the strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock for $546 million and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $123 million. At the end of Q3, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $2.5 billion.  Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders, to anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. On year-to-date sales performance and our expectations for the remainder of Q4, we are reiterating our fiscal 2022 full year expectations for net sales growth of approximately 11%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 2 percentage points from the 53rd week, and we are updating our expectation for same-store sales growth for Q4, which we expect same-store sales growth in the range of 6% to 7%, which would result in growth toward the upper end of our previous range of approximately 4% to 4.5%.  Turning to gross margin. We've experienced many challenges over the course of this year, including those related to product cost inflation, supply chain dynamics and the evolution of consumer spending. Since our last update and like many retailers, we have seen an increased headwind from lower-margin consumables, sales mix as customers face growing financial pressure. We expect this headwind to grow in Q4 as our guidance assumes customers continue to feel financial pressures and shift more of their spending to consumable items.  And while we are making good progress toward resolving our storage capacity constraints, we expect some of the cost pressures we have experienced as a result of the delays will carry over into Q4, but will be largely resolved by Q1 of next year. Finally, we are seeing a greater headwind from inventory shrink and damages than we anticipated for the back half of this year.  Overall, while we are confident in the actions, we are taking to address our supply chain challenges, we anticipate the total headwind to gross margin in Q4 from all of these factors will be higher than what we previously contemplated within our financial guidance. With all this in mind, we are updating our EPS guidance. For the fourth quarter, we now expect to deliver EPS in the range of $3.15 to $3.30, which would result in a growth for the full year of approximately 7% to 8%. This is compared to our previous expectation of 12% to 14% EPS for the full year. Both the current and previous ranges include an estimated benefit of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week. And our EPS outlook now assumes an effective tax rate toward the upper end of the previously provided range of 22% to 22.5%.  We now expect capital spending for 2022 to be approximately $1.5 billion, which is at the top end of our previously stated range. Finally, our expectations for share repurchases remain unchanged from what we stated in our Q2 earnings release on August 25, 2022.  Overall, despite the near-term challenges, we are confident in the business and our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we plan to share 2023 guidance on the Q4 call, we feel good about the sales momentum going into next year, coupled with moderating cost pressures.  Let me provide some additional context as it relates to our Q4 outlook. As a reminder, we expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI through the remainder of the year. In addition, we expect the significant expansion of our private fleet, will drive additional benefits going forward despite anticipated continued internal supply chain pressures in the near-term.  With regards to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further the rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect these initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit margin in 2022, as we expect our benefits to gross margin will more than offset the associated SG&A expense.  Consistent with Q2 and Q3, our outlook includes continued investments to further enhance the customer experience, primarily toward incremental labor hours to drive continued improvement in overall in-stock levels and customer experience.  Finally, we also continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track and are seeing savings in 2022, offsetting a portion of wage inflation. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long-term. We're working hard to address the near-term challenges, most of which we believe will be behind us as we enter 2023.  Importantly, we remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.  With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives.  Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We are continuing to make significant progress executing against our robust portfolio of initiatives. Let me take you through some of the recent highlights.  Starting with our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI, which was available in more than 16,000 stores at the end of the third quarter. With over 75% of the assortment at $5 or less, this treasure hunt offering continues to resonate with customers who are seeking value. We continue to be pleased with the sales and margin performance we are seeing from our NCI offering, including market share growth in nonconsumable product categories.  Looking ahead, we expect to realize ongoing benefits from this initiative throughout the remainder of the year and remain on track to complete the rollout across nearly the entire chain by year-end.  Moving to our pOpshelf store concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. We recently celebrated the 2-year anniversary of the first pOpshelf store, along with our 100th store opening. And we are pleased to see the concept continuing to resonate with customers.  During the quarter, we opened 23 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 103 located within 9 states. Additionally, we opened 15 new store-within-a-store concepts during Q3, bringing the total number of Dollar General market stores with a smaller footprint pOpshelf store included to a total of 40.  We remain on track to nearly triple the stand-alone pOpshelf store count this year, which would bring us to a total of nearly 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations by year-end. Looking ahead, we plan to nearly double the pOpshelf store count next year, as our real estate plans for 2023 include opening approximately 150 additional locations, bringing the total number of pOpshelf stores to about 300 by the end of 2023. Overall, we remain excited about the pOpshelf concept and our goal of approximately 1,000 locations by year-end 2025.  Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas.  As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in 2021 and are now delivering to nearly 19,000 stores from 12 facilities. The initial objective of DG Fresh was to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishable department.  Going forward, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh, as we continue to optimize our network further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales.  And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time.  To that end, we offered Fresh produce in more than 3,000 stores at the end of Q3. And looking ahead, plan to add produce in approximately 2,000 stores in 2023, for a total of approximately 5,000 stores by the end of next year.  Finally, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. During Q3, we added more than 17,000 cooler doors across our store base, and we are on track to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2022.  Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have significant incremental opportunity to drive additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead.  Turning now to an update on our health initiative, branded as DG Wellbeing. The initial focus of this project is an expanded health offering, which consists of approximately 30% more feet of selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in more than 3,200 stores at the end of Q3, and we plan to expand to a total of more than 4,000 stores by the end of 2022.  As we seek to further connect customers with our expanded health offering, we have recently launched a partnership with a third-party payment platform to allow customers to use health plan supplemental benefits to purchase various health and wellness-related items in their local Dollar General stores.  And most recently, I'm excited to announce that we launched a pilot of a mobile health clinic provided by DocGo On-Demand to provide basic preventative and urgent care services at a small number of stores in Q3. We plan to test this offering in select stores over the next few months as we continue to work with customers on how to help bring affordable health and wellness closer to home, while further establishing Dollar General as a trusted health partner in the local community. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink and damage reduction.  Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business.  In the third quarter, we completed a total of 798 real estate projects, including 268 new stores, 485 remodels and 45 relocations. For 2022, we now plan to execute approximately 2,945 real estate projects in total, including 1,025 new stores, 1,795 remodels and approximately 125 store relocations. Looking ahead, as I mentioned earlier, we plan to execute approximately 3,170 projects in the United States in 2023 across our Dollar General and pOpshelf banners, including 1,050 new stores, 2,000 remodels and 120 relocations.  Our ability to innovate our store formats continues to be an important strength of the business, and I want to take a moment to provide some additional color on our 2023 real estate strategy.  Approximately 80% of our new stores and nearly all of our relocations will be in one of our larger store formats, which continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional box.  With regards to remodels, approximately 80% will be in our DGTP format, which will provide the opportunity for a significant increase in cooler count as well as the ability to add Fresh produce in many stores.  In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth, we are very excited about our plans to expand internationally, and our goal is to open our first store in Mexico by the end of this fiscal year. As a reminder, these stores, which will be branded under the name [ MeSuper ] Dollar General will be located in underserved communities in Northern Mexico. Looking ahead, we plan to have up to 35 stores open in Mexico by the end of 2023, as we look to extend our value and convenience proposition to a customer base that is similar to our core customer in the United States. These stores will be incremental to our planned 1,050 new store openings.  As we head into 2023, our real estate pipeline remains robust. We see more than 16,000 total opportunities for small box retail stores in the United States, including more than 12,000 for Dollar General stores, approximately 3,000 for pOpshelf and approximately 1,000 for DGX. With these opportunities and our existing footprint of more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any other retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead.  Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint, as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers.  Our efforts remain centered around creating a digital front porch for our customers, as we look to continue building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended Q3 with over 4.5 million monthly active users on the app, and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. Our partnership with DoorDash continues to resonate with both new and existing customers as we look to extend the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. This offering was available in more than 13,000 stores at the end of Q3, and we are very pleased with the year-to-date sales results.  In addition, we are excited about the continued growth of our DG Media Network. We are seeing significant interest and participation from CPG companies and brands, who are seeking to connect with our more than 90 million unique profiles, especially our rural customers, who represent about 30% of the U.S.  After establishing the foundation over the last few years, we are beginning to meaningfully grow this business. As we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both customers and brand partners, while increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business.  Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties.  Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our current goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores and enhancing customer convenience.  The current focus of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 10,500 stores at the end of Q3, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates.  We are also excited about our pilot in select stores, which provides customers the option to utilize self-checkout in all lanes, but also choose a staff register, if preferred. We believe this full self-checkout option could further enhance our convenience proposition, while enabling store teams to dedicate even more time to serving customers. We are currently testing this layout in approximately 250 stores and are pleased with the early customer and associate response.  Looking ahead, we are on track to expand our self-checkout offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of 2022, as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small-box discount retail.  Moving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consists of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will reduce store workload and drive greater efficiencies for our retail leaders and their teams. We also continue to reduce costs through the expansion of our private fleet, which consisted of more than 1,300 tractors at the end of Q3. As a reminder, we have been focused on significantly expanding our private fleet in 2022, as we plan to more than double the number of tractors from 2021, which we expect will account for approximately 40% of our outbound transportation fleet by the end of the year.  Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.  Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for personal and professional development and ultimately, career advancement. Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by the more than 70% of our store employees at or above the lead sales associate position who were placed from within.  In addition, approximately 15% of our growing private fleet team began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. We are pleased with our turnover trends and staffing levels. And applicant flow continues to be strong, further validating our confidence that we are taking the right actions to attract and retain talent.  Ultimately, we believe the opportunity to develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique, competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. We also recently completed our annual Community Giving Campaign, where our employees came together to raise funds for a variety of important causes. And I was once again inspired by the generosity and compassion of our people.  We continue to add incredible talent across the organization in our stores, distribution centers, private fleet and at our store support center. As this new talent joins our tremendous team, I am continually reminded that the people of Dollar General are our greatest strength.  In closing, I am excited about the future as we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, with the number of initiatives we have in place and a unique and strong strategic planning process, we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth, while creating meaningful shareholder value. Finally, as we are in the midst of our busy holiday season, I want to thank our approximately 173,000 employees for their commitment every day to serve our customers.  I am excited about our work together as we head into the final weeks of our year.  With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. So Jeff, maybe first, could you elaborate on what you think is driving the sequential acceleration in same-store sales? I think traffic has now sequentially improved for the second straight quarter. What are you seeing across the income cohort? And then maybe just looking back at past periods of consumer pressure, how sustainable do you see the market share opportunity in front of us? Jeffery Owen : Thanks, Matt. We are very pleased with our 6.8% comp sales increase. And as you mentioned, seeing traffic accelerate again for the second consecutive quarter was very nice to see, and also continuing to grow market share. We grew market share in our consumables and our nonconsumable business. And so when you think about that, our outperformance on sales really was driven in the consumables business, and it really is a testament to our going where the customer wants us to go. And that is something we've always done here at Dollar General. And I think it's a testament to the relevance of our box.  When you think about our box and how we've continued to make it a fuller fill in shop, it really speaks to our ability to serve a broad spectrum of customers. And as you mentioned, with customers -- our core customer, one thing that is encouraging to see is she's still gainfully employed. And we've long said that is the single greatest factor in her economic health. So it's encouraging to see that, and it's encouraging to see us grow productivity and share with her.  And also the encouraging thing we saw this quarter is we grew share in all income levels. And so that's particularly good to see when you think about the higher income levels. One of the things we've been very pleased at is our ability to retain that COVID customer higher than we expected to over the course of several quarters, and we continue to see that here. And we also saw us grow share and customers in the $100,000 income level.  So when you step back and think about it, it again just points to our ability to serve multiple income cohorts. And that will set us up extremely well as we look to the future and our ability to not only make our core customer more productive, but also the ability to retain these new customers. So we feel real good about that.  And as I mentioned around the consumable business, we're pleased with the performance there. And I think the thing to keep in mind, as you step back and you think about where Dollar General is today, our consumable business is a much different business from a profitability standpoint due to our strategic initiatives.  When you think about NCI, our health offering, DG Fresh, it really has made that business a different business from a profitability standpoint. In fact, in the third quarter, our gross margin is 100 basis points higher than it was in 2019, just to give you a little bit of color there.  So again, we feel good about the top line. And as we look forward, we feel we're really well positioned to serve a multiple cohorts of customers in this economic environment. And I'd also say that we're excited to deliver more real estate projects in 2023 than we've ever done at Dollar General.  And I think it's a testament to the robust pipeline and then also the strategic initiatives. So I feel real good about where we are from a sales standpoint and our position to be able to serve our broad customer base as we look forward. Matthew Boss : That's great. And then maybe, John, on gross margin and just to break down some of the components. So do you see these warehouse costs and supply chain efficiency is more transitory and contained to the fourth quarter? Help us to think about LIFO going forward relative to the material gross margin headwind this year, should we anticipate should transportation as a tailwind now from here? And just what inning do you see the drivers of inventory markup in today? John Garratt : Sure, Matt. I'll start with the question around the supply chain costs. And as we called out versus previous expectations, the supply chain costs were a significant headwind more than $40 million above our previous expectations for Q3. And we do see this as near-term. And we're making very good progress toward resolving our storage capacity constraints as more capacity comes online. And we do believe some of these cost pressures, nonetheless, will carry over into Q4. However, we do expect this will largely be resolved in Q1 of next year. So as we look ahead, we anticipate supply chain costs, both internal and external in 2023 to be down quite a bit. We're obviously seeing it improving as others market for carrier costs as well. And so that as a potential tailwind going forward. And then LIFO as well. We're seeing the pace that while it will continue to pressure, Q4, we are seeing the pace of cost increases continue to moderate. And as we look at next year, we'd expect less pressure from LIFO. So certainly, some near-term pressures between LIFO between the supply chain cost.  We also mentioned the sales mix shift and shrink and damages. But as we look to 2023 and beyond, we feel good about, as Jeff mentioned, one, the sales momentum in the business; but also moderating product cost and inflation, particularly around supply chain and LIFO.  And as you look at the initiatives, we have that continue to contribute the other levers we have, not to mention our scale and where we're at in price, we don't see a need to invest. We feel that we're very well positioned as we look ahead to the future to continue expanding gross margin over the long-term. Matthew Boss : That's a great color. Best of luck. John Garratt : You asked about markdowns as well. I didn't want to miss that question. As you look at markdown risk, while up from the unusually low levels last year, markdowns are still well below pre-pandemic levels. If you look at the majority of the inventory growth, it's really driven by inflation.  The team has done a good job anticipating the mix shift in consumer demand and has proactively been adjusting orders. And as a result, we feel very good about the quality of the inventory, ability to mitigate the markdown risk. As always, we've set aside, what we believe is an appropriate markdown level for the upcoming Christmas season. And of course, this is all reflected in our guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : I think a follow-up, John, for you. So this year, you were going to grow earnings sort of in line with [indiscernible] excluding the 53rd week, and now it's going to be below and yet you're doing more sales.  So there's clearly something coiled up here in the model. I know you're not going to guide next year, but the theoretical framework is there should be some recapture. If there is recapture, are you inclined to let that flow? Or do you manage -- do you think the business just manages towards [indiscernible] and I don't know if it's to reinvest or maybe we don't see all the recapture that I'm hinting at? John Garratt : Sure. So as you mentioned, we won't be giving specific guidance on this call. We'll certainly share that on the March call. But I'll just start by reiterating that we feel great about the fundamentals of the business, the sales momentum, coupled with the moderating cost pressures that I just articulated. And as you called out, it is a 1 less week next year that's important to bear in mind.  But again, as you look at the fundamentals of the business, they're very strong. We continue to see ourselves as 10% EPS growers over the long-term. Now we will always balance that with investing back in the business for the long-term, but feel we're very well positioned. And more to come for next year, but feel great about the momentum of the business fundamentals. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And maybe my follow-up, maybe sticking with you on fourth quarter gross margin. I guess, we're trying to build to the pieces, supply chain, mix, shrink. And we're having trouble getting to the entire magnitude. Are you willing to share a little more magnitude by item, by driver? Because it doesn't feel like the consumables mix goes up enough to justify the mix. So there seems like there's something like markdown in there as well. John Garratt : So as you look at the drivers of the additional pressure on Q4, it's the same drivers as Q3, the order is a little bit different. As you look at what we anticipate as the key pressures on Q4 margins is still healthy flow-through, but less than previously expected. The big difference is, first the mix shift. We did see a mix shift in the consumables as customers face financial pressures. We want to go where the customer goes, and like the sales we're seeing, but it does pressure your margin a little bit with the mix of the sales.  The other piece -- we did see -- we mentioned as we progressed through Q3 is a greater headwind from inventory shrink and damages. And that shrink can have a tail to that. Rest assured, the team knows how to deal with this and is taking actions to address it. But it does have a tail to it. And then while we are making good progress resolving our storage capacity constraints with the capacity online, we do believe, as we mentioned, that some of this will carry over into Q4, but be largely resolved by Q1.  So that's the big versus our previous expectations. Obviously, the other big one is LIFO. As you look at LIFO, we called out $148 million in Q3, while we believe the product cost headwind is beginning to moderate. The prior cost increases will continue to pressure Q4 LIFO, and you could do the math as you do -- as you spread that across the year. So that's really the key drivers.  But again, I'll just reiterate, many of these are transitory in nature. And as we look ahead to the future, we feel we're well positioned to resume growing our gross margin over the long-term with the initiatives, the levers, our scale and the pricing position we're in. Operator : Our next question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Corey Tarlowe : Congrats on the continued top line momentum and share gains that you've witnessed.  So with that in mind, maybe could you parse out a little bit what you're seeing in terms of how the customer is behaving because it's clear that traffic is up. The customer is visiting the store more and should -- maybe shifting a little bit into private label. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in that regard and how you're investing to continue to support the growth in that segment? And then secondarily, as you see that mix shift happen more to the consumable side, how do you marry that with the continued growth that you're likely to see in NCI, which should actually help to underpin, I would say, better profitability as we look ahead? Jeffery Owen : Corey, this is Jeff. Thank you for your question. And I'll start with the customer.  I'll reiterate the fact that her gainfully being employed is, again, a very important factor to economic health. And so when we talk to our customers, and I feel like our teams do that better than just about anybody. What we hear is she's feeling the pressure of energy prices and fuel and just the everyday needs are -- it's hard to -- for her to make ends meet. And so she's behaving pretty much exactly the way we would expect her to in times like this. So what we're seeing from her is, as you alluded to, she's coming to us more often. She's buying fewer items on each occasion. And one of the things that we're very pleased is we're being able to help serve her needs through affordability. And our leaning into the dollar price point, our customer is responding incredibly well to that. And I just -- a testament to our team and to our ability to go where the customer wants us to around our $1 price point and affordability.  But when you think about the consumable business, as you mentioned before, you got again, really step back and think about the strategic initiatives and how that has allowed us to really have a more profitable business there. And we've long used consumables to drive traffic and nonconsumables to build the basket.  And so as we think about our -- excuse me, the nonconsumable, as you mentioned, certainly, we continue to be pleased with what we're seeing on NCI, and its ability to really provide that value. When you think about NCI, 80% of the items are $5 or less. And so when you think about our ability to drive traffic through consumables, and then also see a little bit of our ability to rotate the product, the treasure hunt, our breadth strategy. We feel real good about our ability to help that customer continue to get the things they need and the things that they want.  One last thing I'll say around private brand. I mean, we continue to be very pleased with what we're seeing on penetration. But the other thing you got to keep in mind is our customer, again, she's very brand-focused as well. And it's very important to her. And that's where it's important to really lean into our scale.  As John mentioned earlier, the ability of Dollar General and a limited SKU retailer to be able to trade out brands, if necessary for our customer is a really, really powerful way for us to serve for better. And we've said this before, but our customer treats a brand as a brand. And so it gives us the ability to make sure that we're providing her with the value she needs. And our merchant team does that probably better than anybody in retail, in my view.  So as you step back and think about it, we feel we're well positioned and really excited about our ability to continue to listen to our customer go where she wants us to go. And you combine that with the more profitable consumable business and our strategic initiatives and really set up nicely for us to continue to serve her, as we've done for many, many years in all economic cycles. Corey Tarlowe : That's great. And then thanks for laying out the new store plans for next year. I think that helps to really provide a little bit more color as to the predictability and stability that we should expect ahead. Could you talk a little bit more about the strong returns that you're continuing to see on those new stores? And what we should expect more so from a continued ROIC standpoint as it relates to some of these new stores as we look ahead? Jeffery Owen : Yes, Corey, I'll start and then I'll let John fill in on some of your questions around returns.  But our real estate model continues to be a huge strength of this business. I mean the low-risk and high-return model is incredibly powerful. And when you think about the retail landscape today, when you think about some of the challenges other retailers have talked about on the real estate front, I'm just very, very excited and proud of the fact that we're going to deliver more projects than we ever have at Dollar General in 2023. And with 1,050 new stores, it continues to just highlight our ability to serve the customer and our ability through format innovation, our real estate model, our technology, we're able to go where the customer needs us to go. And so feel great about that. And really pleased at the fact, through format innovation, this larger store we're opening, our new store performance has been incredibly positive.  And I'm very, very pleased at our ability to exceed our pro formas, and we continue to see that. So that larger store format is continuing to deliver higher sales per square foot, which is excited. And as you know, the large majority of our openings are in that larger footprint. But as you think about the next year in the future, I think the other thing that excites us here is the pipeline that we have.  And on the U.S. alone, we have 16,000 additional opportunities, and we feel great about our ability to capture those. And certainly, our fair share, which we've certainly demonstrated, but 12,000 additional for DG, 3,000 for pOpshelf and then 1,000 for DGX. So stepping back, you can probably hear in my excitement about the real estate and our ability to continue to grow here. And we feel like we're being very prudent in this environment, I'm very, very pleased with the team's performance here.  So I'll kick it over to John for your return question. John Garratt : Yes. And just -- echoing Jeff's comments, we're very pleased with the results we're seeing. As he mentioned, we're above pro forma in sales, which puts us ahead of schedule in terms of the IRRs. Again, we target a 20% to 22% after-tax IRR based on the sales. And as we outperform in sales, that puts us a little ahead on the returns as well.  And feel not only great about the -- and again, it's always important to bear in mind that it includes the impact of cannibalization, which is very minimal, has been very consistent, just given the localized nature of the shop. We continue to see paybacks less than 2 years. So it continues to be a fantastic investment that we continue to hit the gas on. And we're also really pleased with returns we get on our remodels as well, and we're doing not only a record number of overall projects this year, but a record number of remodels, which really helps drive the comp. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : John, I want to hopefully get some frame of reference on 2 factors that are impacting the gross margin. So, a, you mentioned $40 million of supply chain costs that are above and beyond what you expected, does that go to $30 million in the fourth quarter? And if that's in the right ballpark, you used the term of beat, which you can interpret a lot of different ways. I think what most of the market wants to know is, does abate mean you're going to incur $70 million this year that will go away because those are extraordinary costs next year? And as part of that, the other piece of it is the LIFO, which the LIFO headwind because that's needs to be $450 million or so if we just add $100 million for the fourth quarter. If there's a linear path of this inflation, meaning it goes from 9, 8, 7, 6 so forth, would that LIFO headwind that's going to be, call it, $450 million this year, be like $300 million next year, so you get a $150 million benefit? Sorry for so many numbers and so much confusion. John Garratt : No. No. Thank you, Michael. I'll try and tackle each of these. In terms of the carryover impact of the supply chain costs. We didn't give a specific number on that. It will be less, but still a meaningful impact to us.  In terms of LIFO, the way to think about that is even though we don't anticipate -- we anticipate a slowdown in the number of price increases. The way you do that number is at a point in time, we project the full year impact of all the price increases we're aware of, and we spread that across the year. So that gets you in the game of what Q4 looks like. And as we look ahead to next year, it remains to be seen, but would anticipate a considerable reduction to that LIFO number.  So as you look at -- as I mentioned, as you look ahead to next year, we think the supply chain costs will be down considerably because we won't have these near-term onetime costs, we don't anticipate because we think that will be resolved in Q1. And then the market is favorable in terms of just overall transportation costs, both foreign and domestic. And of course, we continue to stand up our private fleet, which we're going to -- every time we convert, we take 20% out and we're going to double that in size this year. So that's certainly a significant savings driver for us as well. And so as you look ahead to next year, I think it's safe to assume that there's a number of tailwinds.  There's certainly some headwinds we mentioned. We'll have to wait and see what the mix does. We want to be there for the customer, and we'll go where she goes. So we have to see where that goes. As we said, shrink has a tail to it. And we're all over it. We know how to attack that, but it does have a bit of a tail. So as you look ahead to next year, there's some puts and takes. But again, we feel like there's a lot of tailwinds when you think of LIFO, when you think of the supply chain costs and all the other levers that we've talked about, not to mention the initiatives. Michael Lasser : Okay. My follow-up question will be less a bit picky. I'm sorry. The -- we've seen now some cost pressure at Dollar General. This follows a significant decline in profitability your largest competitor. Should we take these as onetime event? Or is there anything to say that just the overall profitability of the small box value convenience sector is permanently under pressure or long-lasting under pressure because of some of the competitive dynamics? Because of the shift to consumables and other factors? Or would you expect that this is not a trend that's going to be long lasting? John Garratt : Yes. I'll just reiterate, we see most of the pressures as transitory. When you look at the LIFO, when you look at the supply chain, we see that as transitory. We still feel very good about our nonconsumable products, and see this more as a transitory macro pressure.  Again, we're growing share. We're just kind of following the market trend, which people are just shopping more toward consumables versus discretionary items. But we're taking share and feel that will certainly do very well there as the economy improves.  And just structurally, we feel we're well positioned in terms of -- as we look at wages, we feel we're well positioned in terms of applicant flow and staffing levels. We feel we're investing appropriately in the business. We feel that our pricing is very appropriate.  And again, I think it's important to mention that as you look at Q3, yes, we were down 27 basis points in gross margin, but we're still about 1 point above pre-pandemic levels despite all these transitory pressures I mentioned. We're still a point above where we were back in 2019 and Q3. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Curious on the storage capacity and supply chain inefficiencies. If there was a sales impact during the quarter as well as the cost impact that you talked about. Maybe if you could frame that, also, same question, if you expect there to be a sales impact in 4Q? And related to that, was the pressure any region in particular where you saw the cost and/or sales impact? And how much of a differential was there in terms of the performance of that region versus your others? Jeffery Owen : Yes. Thanks. I'll tell you, as we said before, the delays of our temporary storage facilities, certainly, that unexpected delay did impact the quarter from a profitability standpoint. But again, I reiterate how pleased we were with the strong sales performance we saw. And the nice thing is like it normally is at DG, it's pretty broad-based. And so I think, again, that goes to the consistency of our ability to serve a customer across, not only a broad swath of the United States, but also around the income levels I mentioned earlier.  And we're very pleased and excited that our temporary storage facilities are now online. We're also excited that our 2 new permanent regional hubs that are going to serve us extremely well. As we look to the future, they're also online. And of course, those things will take some time to get fully productive and to allow us to catch-up.  So again, I would also mention we're pleased that we had in stock improvement year-over-year in Q3. So again, when you kind of bundle it all together, I think the team did a nice job of overcoming some of these challenges, to deliver for the customer, go where she wants us to go. I think that translated into our strong comp, our strong market share gains in both consumables and nonconsumables and a second consecutive quarter of sequential traffic increases. So again, feel pleased about the top line and feel pleased about where we have opened up our capacity. And finally, I'll just mention, as you look forward over the next 18 months, bringing on 4 permanent facilities, that will increase our capacity by 20%. And is something we factored into our strategic plan and feel great about how that's going to serve us well and allow us to continue to grow this business in the years ahead. Operator : Our last question will be from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So just going back to your commentary on shrink. I was curious if you can provide more color in terms of what's driving the higher shrink lately opportunities you guys see to reduce that going forward? If there's any way to quantify how you think about the headwind for Q4 or even what you saw in Q3? John Garratt : Yes. So as we mentioned, we saw increased shrink later in Q3. We believe this is largely -- Rupesh, largely attributable to the inflationary environment, coupled with higher inventory levels. Overall, as you know, retail is seeing higher shrink in this environment. Now this can have a tail. So we did say we expect this to carry over into Q4. I think it's instructive as we listed out the gross margin drivers, I think that was the last on the list of drivers for Q3. But bear in mind, that was later in Q3.  So we anticipate a larger -- probably a larger impact if you have a full quarter of that in Q4. But in Q3, it was the smallest of the items we called out. But again, we've done this drill many times. If you look at our shrink levels, they're still very low from a historical perspective, just not quite as low as we were at record levels recently. But the team knows how to execute against this, and I think we're putting the right tactics in place to address it. We're increasing the amount of tagging with -- for our EAS units. We're leveraging technology like exception-based reporting, and we have very good process rigor and focus on this to tame it. But we'll have a little bit of tail until these actions take hold. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up question. So just on trade-in, I know your team expect to trade in to continue into Q3, and I believe Q4 as well. At this point, the trade-in that you're seeing, is that consistent with what you'd see in a recession? Or is it -- would you say it still below what you typically see in downturn? Jeffery Owen : Yes. Rupesh, as I said earlier, we're very pleased to be able to see that we're growing share in customers across all income levels. So that's encouraging. And really, again, I go back to the relevance of our brand of our box and our tremendous ability to listen and respond to what our customers are looking for.  And certainly, I would tell you, the core customer is certainly behaving the way we expected her to. And also, as you think about it, one of the things that we continue to be pleased with is the fact that when we were introduced to that new customer during COVID, we continue to retain her at higher-than-expected levels. So I would say that as we sit here today, we feel real good about what we're seeing across all the income brackets. We feel real good about seeing the growth there. And I think we're very well positioned to continue to serve them.  And I think if you step back and think about Dollar General, we're an all-weather brand, and we've been doing this for many, many years, and we continue to do that. And so -- and we will continue to do that. We'll go where the customer wants us to go, which we did this quarter.  And we're also positioned to continue to do that as we move forward and continue to deliver on our strategic initiatives that really makes a more well-rounded shop and a greater appeal for a broad swath of customers. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Owen for closing comments. Jeffery Owen : Well, thank you for all the questions and your continued interest in Dollar General. I just wanted to wrap up with 3 points. First, while we had some unanticipated challenges within our supply chain during the quarter, we're confident in the actions we've taken to address these near-term issues and expect continued improvement as we move through Q4 and into next year; second, we believe we are well positioned to keep growing market share, especially in an environment where customers are even more focused on value; and third, we believe our strong value and convenience proposition combined with our robust portfolio of strategic initiatives sets us up for a very long runway of growth.  And we couldn't be more excited about where the future is headed. I want to thank you again for listening, and I hope you have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

Jeffery Owen : Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our associates for their dedication to serving our customers and communities this year. I am inspired by this team's commitment to our mission of serving others and the passion they have for helping our customers save time and money every day. Our fourth quarter performance was led by strong comp sales growth of 5.7%. And while this result was below our expectations, our performance included market share gains in both consumables and nonconsumables and contributed to a net sales increase of 17.9% to $10.2 billion. Our Q4 comp sales were driven by an increase in average basket size, primarily attributable to inflation and partially offset by a slight decrease in customer traffic, primarily due to a decrease in customer traffic in late December. And similar to recent quarters, average units per basket were down. Notably, both November and January comp sales at 6.7% and 6.5%, respectively, were within our expected range of 6% to 7% for the quarter. However, our December sales performance was negatively impacted by winter storm Elliott, which had the most significant effect on our stores in the final days leading up to Christmas. The quarter was also impacted by greater-than-anticipated inventory damages, which contributed to diluted EPS results that were below our expectations. While the storm had some damages impact, we also incurred higher damages than expected as we work through the residual impact of the storage capacity constraints and related store and distribution inefficiencies we experienced during the second half of the year. Although we expect some of these related impacts to be with us through the end of Q1, we are pleased to have the storage capacity constraints largely behind us, which we believe positions us well moving forward. Turning to a few highlights of the 2022 fiscal year. Net sales increased 10.6% to $37.8 billion and included a benefit of approximately 2 percentage points or $678 million in sales from the 53rd week. Comp sales for the year increased 4.3%, driven by strong growth in basket size. Although a significant portion of the basket growth was attributable to inflation, we were pleased to see an average basket size at the end of the year of more than five items and nearly $17. The team accomplished a great deal in 2022, and we closed the year with significant progress on our strategic initiatives and operating priorities while achieving several key milestones in Q4 and the weeks thereafter. We were particularly excited to celebrate the opening of our 19,000 store in Joplin, Missouri in January, as we continue to support our customers with our unique combination of value and convenience in their hometown communities. We also completed the initial rollout of our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI with the offering now in nearly all of our stores across the chain. Finally, we made strong progress in our supply chain, reducing our storage capacity constraints and improving operations during the quarter. More specifically, and as we said we would do, we added significant capacity in Q4, bringing nearly 3 million square feet of distribution capacity online. These efforts culminated with the opening of our newest distribution center in Blair, Nebraska during the quarter. I also want to highlight that we have started 2023 with the opening of our first store in Mexico. And while the store has only been open a few short weeks, we are very encouraged by the early response from our new customers. These achievements are a testament to this team's hard work and continued focus on execution and innovation as we continue to deliver on our mission of serving others. Turning now to an update on our customers. In addition to adjusting the mix of their baskets, we continue to see customers shift spending to more affordable options, including our private brands, which represent more than 20% of our total sales. Within consumables, private brand growth, both in absolute dollars and penetration was the highest in the fourth quarter. We also increased our share of wallet and share of trips across all segments of our core customer in Q4, and we believe we will be increasingly important to them in the year ahead. With regard to trade-in behavior, customers and income brackets above our core customers are shopping with us at an increasing rate, underscoring our belief that our value and convenience proposition resonates with a broad spectrum of customers. We remain focused on our goal to be priced at relative parity with mass merchants and we continue to feel very good about our price position relative to competitors and all classes of trade. Furthermore, given the strong demand from customers, we remain committed to offering products at the $1 or less price point. Notably, during Q4, our comp sales were over 30% in our Value Valley set, which is comprised entirely of items at the $1 price point. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the strong performance of this program and the value it offers to our customers. In addition, we believe we are well positioned to continue serving both new and existing customers, and we are moving with great intentionality to build on our momentum. To this end, we are excited about our plans for 2023. Building on the investments we made in 2022, we plan to make a larger targeted incremental investment of approximately $100 million in our stores this year. This investment will primarily consist of incremental labor hours to support our expectations regarding consistent store standards while further enhancing the associate and customer experience. In turn, we believe this investment will position us to drive greater on-shelf availability and capture additional market share while amplifying the potential of our initiatives and ensuring our readiness for our growing customer base. And with the progress we have made in the supply chain, the prior investments we have made in wages, and the growing customer engagement we are seeing, we believe we are well positioned to see a meaningful return on this investment. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and we believe our innovation will continue to distance and differentiate Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape. In summary, we are excited about our plans to deliver strong growth in 2023 while also making significant and deliberate investments in the business. We believe our customer and communities will need us even more as we move throughout 2023. And as a mature retailer in growth mode, we are well positioned to serve them while also creating long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to John. John Garratt : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Now that Jeff has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Jeff already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. For Q4, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.9%, a decrease of 35 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increased LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category, and increases in inventory shrink, damages and markdowns, partially offset by higher inventory markups and a reduction in transportation costs. Of note, product cost inflation continued as a significant headwind, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $164 million during the quarter and approximately $517 million for the full year. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.7%, a decrease of 29 basis points. This decrease was driven by expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail occupancy costs, incentive compensation and retail labor. These were partially offset by certain expenses that were greater as a percentage of net sales in the current year period primarily utilities. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 17.1% to $933 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.1%, a decrease of 6 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2% and compares to 21.2% in the fourth quarter last year. This higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to decreased income tax benefits associated with the stock-based compensation compared to 2021. Finally, EPS for the fourth quarter increased 15.2% to $2.96. For the full year, EPS increased 5% to $10.68 and included an estimated positive impact of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $6.8 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 20.4% overall and 14.3% on a per store basis. This increase continues to reflect the impact of product cost inflation as well as a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in the home and seasonal categories, primarily due to the continued rollout of NCI as well as the earlier receipt of seasonal goods. While inventory growth is still elevated, the pace is moderating as we expected. Notably, our Q4 inventory growth rate per store was essentially half of what it was in Q3. Looking ahead, we anticipate more normalized growth rates as we move through 2023. Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape. In 2022, the business generated cash flows from operations totaling $2 billion, a decrease of 31%, which was primarily attributable to higher inventory levels. Total capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution, transportation projects and spending related to the strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of our common stock for $1.1 billion and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $121 million. At the end of the year, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.4 billion. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. Moving to our financial outlook for the fiscal 2023 year. We anticipate the challenging economic and operating environment to continue into 2023, but we believe we are well positioned to drive strong growth as we move throughout the year. For 2023, we are reiterating the financial guidance we provided on February 23, 2023, and providing additional financial guidance to include the following expectations. Net sales growth in the range of approximately 5.5% to 6%, including an anticipated negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points due to lapping the 2022 53rd week; same-store sales growth in the range of 3% to 3.5%; and EPS growth in the range of approximately 4% to 6%, including estimated negative impacts of approximately 3 percentage points due to higher interest expense and approximately 4 percentage points due to lapping the 2022 53rd week. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of approximately 22.5% to 23%. We also expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, which includes the impact of significant inflation in the cost of certain building materials, construction of new distribution centers and continued investment in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth. With regard to shareholder returns, our Board of Directors recently approved an increased quarterly dividend payment of $0.59 per share. We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $500 million of our common stock this year. This is a lower amount as compared to the recent years but consistent with our capital allocation priorities and reflects our commitment to our current credit rating, our continued strong liquidity position and confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for our business. Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect EPS growth to be much stronger in the second half compared to the first half. This is due in part to our expectation of continued headwinds from sales mix pressure, higher interest expense and increased shrink and damages as we move through the first half of the year. We anticipate certain of these headwinds to be most pronounced in Q1, including an estimated year-over-year increase in interest expense of approximately $40 million, inventory damages and residual impacts of the storage capacity constraints and related inefficiencies that Jeff mentioned earlier. In addition, we expect the year-over-year net impact of the labor investment to be most significant in Q1 as we don't begin lapping last year's smaller investments until Q2, and we believe the benefits of the incremental labor will become more significant later in the year. As we move into the back half, we also anticipate a benefit from lapping the significant supply chain costs and winter storm impacts from the second half of 2022. Turning now to gross margin for 2023. In addition to the material benefit from lapping the increased supply chain expenses in the second half of 2022, we expect significant benefits from greater distribution center capacity and productivity, lower carrier rates, expansion of our private tractor fleet and other distribution and transportation efficiencies. We also expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI. Furthermore, we anticipate a significant contribution from our DG Media Network, which Jeff will discuss in more detail in a moment. Partially offsetting some of these expected benefits are the anticipated sales mix pressure and increased inventory shrink and damages I mentioned as well as increased markdowns as we return to rates more in line with the historic norms. With regard to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2023, as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. And as Jeff noted, we plan to make an incremental investment of approximately $100 million in our stores, primarily through additional labor hours. While this investment will pressure SG&A in 2023, we believe it is the right thing for the business and will drive stronger in-store execution, positioning us well to build on the momentum we have with our customers. We expect a headwind from inflationary pressures in our business. So we continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track. In closing, we are grateful for the team's hard work to deliver for our customers in 2022. Looking ahead, we are excited about our growth plans for 2023, including strong sales and operating profit while simultaneously making significant and deliberate investments in the business. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We are confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffery Owen : Thank you, John. Let me take a few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, which have transformed this company in recent years, resulting in strong growth and enhanced profitability.  Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. Starting with NCI. With the initial rollout phase now complete, we will focus on continuing to refine the assortment and enhance the treasure hunt offering to provide value to our customers in the nonconsumable categories. Overall, we are very pleased with the success of NCI including market share gains in nonconsumable sales in Q4. Moving to our pOpshelf store concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 37 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 140 at the end of 2022, located within 14 states. While sales in this economic environment have been somewhat softer than our earlier results, we continue to be pleased with the customer response. Looking ahead, we plan to more than double the pOpshelf shell store count in 2023, bringing the total number of pOpshelf stores to nearly 300 by year-end, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 locations by year-end 2025. Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. We are now delivering perishable products to more than 19,000 stores from 12 facilities, and we continue to be pleased with the cost savings from this initiative and importantly, the significantly enhanced profitability of our perishables offering. In addition to capturing cost savings, DG Fresh also aims to increase sales in frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department, which had our strongest rate of comp sales growth during 2022. Going forward, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. To that end, at the end of 2022, we offered fresh produce in more than 3,200 stores with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 5,000 stores by the end of 2023. Finally, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. During 2022, we added more than 66,000 cooler doors across our store base. And we plan to install a similar number of cooler doors in 2023. Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made and savings we realized to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have an opportunity to drive significant additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead. Turning now to an update on our health initiative, branded as DG Wellbeing. As a reminder, the initial focus of this project is an expanded health offering, which consists of approximately 30% more selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 4,400 stores at the end of 2022, and we plan to expand to a total of more than 5,500 stores by the end of 2023. Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering and testing of our mobile clinic with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately, services over time, particularly in rural America. Finally, we also plan to make significant enhancements to our private brand offering in 2023 as we know how important these value offerings are for our customers. We are increasing private brand offerings across many important categories, including candy and snacks, perishables, pet food and over-the-counter health care products. We believe these products will further differentiate Dollar General in the marketplace as we look to provide our customers with tremendous value on quality products. In addition to the initiatives I just discussed, as well as the anticipated supply chain efficiencies I mentioned earlier, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in global sourcing as well as shrink and damage reduction. Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In 2022, we completed a total of 2,961 real estate projects, including 1,039 new stores, 1,795 remodels and 127 relocations. For 2023, our goal remains to execute approximately 3,170 real estate projects in the United States across our Dollar General and pOpshelf banners, including 1,050 new stores, 2,000 remodels and 120 store relocations. Notably, this would be the most real estate projects we have executed in 1 year. Our ability to innovate on the store formats continues to be an important strength for the business, and we expect to leverage multiple formats to drive strong returns in the year ahead. Approximately 80% of our new stores in nearly all of our relocations will be in one of our larger store formats, which continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional store. With regard to remodels, approximately 80% will be in our DGTP format, which provides the opportunity for a significant increase in cooler count as well as the ability to add fresh produce in many stores. In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth, we are excited about our international expansion. We were pleased to open our first Mi Super Dollar General in Monterrey, Mexico last month, and we have been very encouraged by the customer response and community reception we have seen so far. Looking ahead, our goal is to have approximately 20 stores serving underserved communities in Northern Mexico by the end of 2023 as we look to leverage our brand awareness while extending our value and convenience proposition to a customer base that is similar to our core customer in the United States. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and with more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around creating a digital front porch for our customers as we look to continue building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended 2022 with approximately 4.5 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to continue to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. Our partnership with DoorDash continues to serve us as an important extension of the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. DoorDash is available in nearly 14,000 stores, and we anticipate extending this offering to an additional 1,000 stores in 2023. We are pleased with the incremental sales growth attributed to this partnership as well as its profitability, and we believe we have an opportunity to drive even stronger growth moving forward. In addition, we are excited about the continued growth of our DG Media Network. We are seeing significant interest and participation from CPG companies and brands who are seeking to connect with our more than 90 million unique customer profiles, especially rural customers, who represent about 30% of the country. We expect our DG Media Network to grow significantly in 2023 as we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners while substantially increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business. Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, and we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach. The first phase of this initiative, which included rolltainer optimization and self-checkout is focused on enhancing customer convenience and labor productivity in our stores. Self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, was available in more than 11,000 stores at the end of 2022, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates. Looking ahead, our goal is to have a self-checkout offering in more than 13,000 stores by the end of 2023, including the full self-checkout option in more than 2,000 stores as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail. Moving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consist of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will drive greater efficiencies for our retail leaders and their teams while laying the foundation for additional phases of Fast Track in the future. We also continue to reduce costs through the expansion of our private tractor fleet, which is one of the largest private retail fleets in the U.S. Our fleet consisted of more than 1,600 tractors at the end of 2022 and accounted for more than 40% of our outbound transportation needs. Looking ahead, we plan to have more than 2,000 tractors in our private fleet by the end of 2023, which would account for more than 50% of our outbound transportation fleet. Overall, our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we created more than 10,000 new jobs in 2022, while continuing to drive opportunities for personal and professional development and ultimately, career advancement. Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by internal placement rates of more than 70% at or above the lead sales associate position. Additionally, more than 10% of our growing private fleet team, which nearly doubled in size in 2022, began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. We continue to have great success hiring the talent we need, and we are pleased with our staffing levels and applicant flow. Ultimately, we believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is what sets Dollar General apart from the competition and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. We added incredible individuals across the organization in 2022 as we grew teams in our stores, distribution centers, private fleet and at our store support center, while also adding a local team in Mexico to support our new customers in those communities. In addition to new opportunities, we have made significant investments in our people, including raising average hourly retail wages by approximately 23% over the last 3 years and investing over 4 million training hours in 2022 to promote education and development. The people of Dollar General are our greatest strength and the driving force of this company. In closing, we made great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives in 2022, while making a difference in the lives of our customers. As we enter 2023, we are excited about our robust plans for growth, which we believe will further enhance our ability to serve our customers in meaningful ways. We are the innovation leader in our space, and we are laser-focused on executing at a high level to continue driving long-term sustainable growth while delivering strong returns for our shareholders. Finally, I want to thank more than 170,000 employees for their commitment to serving others every day, and I am looking forward to all we will accomplish together in 2023. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Sorry about the noise. Open-ended question for you. So the business has executed well over a long period of time. Last couple of quarters, we've had some missteps or things that haven't gone to plan. Not all of that I think is clear to us for the Street. And yet all these growth initiatives are still happening at the same time. So the open-ended question is have you debated or is the debate the balance of sort of the growth against investments that's focusing on the core? Jeffery Owen : Well, Simeon, thank you for the question. I first want to say, certainly, the last 2 quarters have been challenging. And I can tell you, we're disappointed in our results. This team takes great pride in delivering on our commitments and we've been doing that for the almost 30 years I've been here. And that is something that is not changing. And I can tell you, we have a tremendously deep and outstanding team that's laser focused on executing and innovating over the long term.  And certainly, we have faced some challenges. But what we do here at Dollar General is we control what we can control, and that has allowed us to emerge even stronger as we move forward. So as I think about our balance between execution and innovation, one of the things I think it's important to remember is we have a long track record of execution, and this team will continue to deliver on that. And on the innovation front, we don't do things on the side of our desks. And so as we do innovate, one of the things that our team does more than anything is, as you know, capital is not an issue for us. It's all about organizational capacity. And I think the team has done an excellent job of making sure that we've dedicated the resources, the focus and the time to be able to grow this foundation. And it certainly served us very well. If you think about these challenging times we're in right now, this company is in a much different place. And as our customer has gravitated towards more consumables, the investments we've made in our strategic initiatives have allowed us to serve her even better and more profitably. And so as we look forward, we're excited about some of the investments we announced today, which will be on top of the strategic investments we've made previously, which has put us in a very, very enviable position of having a rock-solid foundation strategically and a laser-focused on execution. And this team is committed to delivering that as we look forward into '23 and beyond. Simeon Gutman : And the one follow-up to that is the $100 million in wages, I don't think it's a big surprise, but it was maybe in man hours and not rate. So can you talk about that trade-off or the balance between those two and where, I guess, you feel comfortable where you are on rates? Jeffery Owen : Yes. We absolutely do, Simeon, and that's one of the -- that's a great distinction. Here, at Dollar General, for the 85 years we've been around, the store has always been the company. And our ability to serve local communities is something that we do better than anybody and we take great pride in that. And so when you think about the investment that we're very excited about, the reason why it's in hours rather than wages is because we've been paying competitive wages for many years. And you heard in my prepared comments that our wages have increased 23% over the last 3 years. So our ability to attract and retain talent remains one of our core competencies. And so I'm -- the other thing you got to remember is where our stores are located. They're located in rural communities. 75% are in communities at 20,000 or less. And we prevent -- we provide career growth opportunities that are unmatched in retail, which leads to our staffing levels being very robust, which we mentioned. And that gives us the opportunity because we're in such a good position to invest in the hours. And so as we think about hours, we're pleased at what we believe this will do to elevate our store standards and our consistency, which we believe the customer will benefit and the associate will benefit. And so as you -- as we move throughout '23, when you combine the improvements we're making in our supply chain, which really gives us the timing to do this, and you combine that with the in-stock improvements, our customers will begin to see our standards improve, our on-shelf availability will improve, and we'll be ready to serve that growing customer base that we're really pleased that we're seeing. And so that's what gives us the confidence in this. We feel this is the right level of investment. And the reason we feel that way is because we've been testing and learning this in 2022. You know Dollar General very well. We don't do things just on a whim. We test and learn. We've been doing that in '22. We liked what we saw. And we wanted to make sure our supply chain was in a position where we could take advantage of the ability to elevate the experience for the customer while we flow goods freely to the stores. And right now, we're in a good position to do that as we enter '23, and we're excited about what this is going to do for the customer and ultimately, the return we're going to see over time. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So Jeff, could you speak to recent behavior that you're seeing from the low-income consumer? Or maybe any changes in the ranking of their priorities from those customer surveys that I know you run regularly? And John, help us to think about the cadence of comps as we think about the year? Or just any color on the first quarter same-store sales? Or any comments on business to date just relative to that 3% to 3.5% full year forecast? Jeffery Owen : Well, thanks, Matt. I'll start, and then I'll kick it over to John. As you think about the customer, one of the good things about Dollar General is we're an all-weather brand. And we've shown over the last 3 decades how we can serve that customer in any economic environment. But what we're seeing right now with our customer is the best news we have is that she's still employed. And as we've talked about for many years, that is the single most important factor to her economic health. But we are certainly, as we talk to our customers, and as you know, Matt, we do this very, very frequently, and our digital capabilities allow us to do it in many different ways, which we're pleased, we're seeing that she's worse off financially. And it's primarily due to food inflation. And obviously, as you think about how that changes her behaviors, one of the things we're seeing is she's relying more on savings, credit cards, and also borrowing money, quite frankly, from friends. And as that shows up in the store, what we're seeing in the shopping behavior is that translates into our customer coming more often, she's buying fewer items on occasion. And I got to tell you, one of the things we're very, very pleased with is the fact that we are still leaning hard into our dollar price point. And we're there for that customer. And as you saw in our prepared comments, that is resonating extremely well with her, as you saw from the comp sales we're seeing in that category. But also, we're seeing her lean into private brands, and we're seeing her shift her purchases more to consumables. But as you know, our core customer, she's the smartest customer, I believe, in retail, and she figures this out over time. And our box is more relevant than ever as a result of the investments we've made over the last several years. And that allows us to go where the customer wants us to go and do it more profitably. And that's a very enviable position for us, and I think our market share gains kind of show that. But that's kind of what we're seeing from the customer standpoint. And certainly, there's some near-term challenges that have just recently emerged. I'll let John talk about that in Q1. John Garratt : Yes. So in terms of the customer, as Jeff said, we're continuing to see an increasingly economically strained customer, and we're seeing shopping behaviors indicative of this environment.  The two recent events we're monitoring is the termination of SNAP benefits, the emergency waivers in the remaining states, coupled with lower tax refunds in recent weeks. It's possible this could further pressure the low-income customers somewhat in the near term remains to be seen. We didn't see an impact last year. Some rolled off, but the customer is in a different place now. So we'll carefully monitor that, but we continue to believe that the customer needs us even more in tough environments as history has shown, and our full year guidance is reflective of all we know today. In terms of the shape of the year, I'll kind of talk to first half, second half and then Q1, both in terms of sales as well as earnings. As you look at the shape of the year, as we indicated, it's really a back half story for EPS growth. Now we're expecting sales comp to be relatively even between the first half and the second half, slightly higher in the second half. But then we expect continued headwinds, as we mentioned, from sales mix pressure, higher interest expense and increased shrink and damages as we move through Q1 or rather the first half. And then in the second half, we anticipate a pretty sizable benefit from lapping the significant supply chain costs and winter storm impacts from the second half of 2022 as well as the benefit of the initiatives that we're driving. Now as you look at Q1, we mentioned that we anticipate certain headwinds to be most pronounced in Q1. That includes the estimated year-over-year increase in interest expense, which we quantified as $40 million as well as inventory damages and then the residual impact of the storage capacity constraints and related supply chain efficiencies -- inefficiencies we've mentioned. And then the other piece is with regard to the labor investment. We expect the year-over-year net impact -- pressure from that to be most significant in Q1. And that's because we don't begin lapping last year's smaller investments until Q2 and believe the benefits of the incremental labor will be more significant later in the year. Matthew Boss : Great. And then maybe just a follow-up, John, on the balance sheet. Could you just update us on free cash priorities? What is the multiyear debt leverage target? How best to think about CapEx as a percent of sales moving forward? And just share repurchase as a use of cash going forward? John Garratt : Sure. I'll start by saying that our capital allocation priorities have not changed. Our first priority remains investing in the business. When you have high return growth opportunities like new store growth, remodels and our strategic initiatives, that's where we focus our capital. Then our second priority is then returning the excess cash to shareholders based on the excess cash and debt capacity, paying a competitive dividend as we increased this quarter, and then by buying back shares with the remaining excess cash and debt capacity. But we remain focused on protecting our current investment-grade credit rating by keeping our adjusted debt to EBITDA around 3. In terms of CapEx, that is up a bit this year. We guided to $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Really includes the impact of pretty significant inflation, particularly when you think of steel. As we accelerate the unit growth story here, the remodels as well as build, we're working on three distribution centers here, which is going to help our capacity. So it takes some capital to do that, but we see great returns in these. And as you look at the stores, not only are we doing more stores, we're doing bigger stores. And we love what we see with these bigger stores with more sales, more profit per store. So a little more CapEx but really like the return from these. So I think that's the way to think about our capital allocation priorities and the drivers. Operator : Our next question is from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Peter Keith : You had commented just on one of the last questions around tax refunds and SNAP as potential headwinds. I was hoping you could also address the social security cost of living increase that kicked in at the beginning of the year. Has that been any tailwind to your business that you've noted so far? John Garratt : Yes. I'll elaborate on SNAP a little bit, and then I can talk about tax refunds and then talk about COLA. In terms of SNAP, it's interesting. You had an increase -- a pretty good increase in the tender over the last few years since the pandemic, as states enacted the emergency allotment benefits. Over the last couple of years, we've seen about 18 states roll off -- some of our key states. And what we saw is with the elimination of this, we saw an offset in other tender methods. And we didn't see an overall impact to our sales. What we are monitoring though, is that, coupled with the tax refunds, which are lower in general, they're a little bit ahead in terms of the number of returns filed. But per return, what we're seeing so far and everybody is seeing, is a lower return overall in terms of the dollars. And so we're monitoring the two. Too early to call, but monitoring if those two and where the customer is at right now has a different impact remains to be seen. In terms of COLA, we did see some bump from COLA, particularly those consumers and those stores that over-index with that consumer that receives benefits based on COLA. However, I would say, while a benefit, we saw some bump, not a significant impact. Peter Keith : Okay. And then I wanted to ask you a little bit about the LIFO impact. So $517 million in the full year is pretty meaningful headwind that you've experienced. I guess if the Fed's going to achieve their mission and moderate inflation here over the next year or 2, you should probably have less of a LIFO charge. Do you have any LIFO benefit or lower charge here factored in for 2023 at this point? John Garratt : Yes. The way to think about this is very significant LIFO charge last year. We don't expect a deflationary environment this year, so we do expect a LIFO charge. But we are assuming a more moderate LIFO charge. So less of a headwind this year. I think one thing to just bear in mind as you think about the year-over-year, we did mitigate where we could, the LIFO charge by taking targeted pricing actions as we saw the market move. So that mitigated the impact of that. So I wouldn't consider this fully a tailwind, but certainly less of a headwind as we go into this year. Operator : Our next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Scot Ciccarelli : First, can you just clarify, John, like are you expecting earnings to actually be down in the first half or just lower? And then my main question is, we've seen a pretty significant decrease in payables to inventory over the last couple of quarters. This quarter, for example, inventory was actually up over $1 billion, payables were actually down year-over-year. Can you just provide any more color on what's happening there? And do you expect that to ramp up to -- kind of the payables inventory to ramp up to historical levels? Or is there some sort of structural change, whether it's mix or capacity changes, et cetera, that is influencing that? John Garratt : Yes. So in terms of the cadence for the year, what we said is it really is a back-half story. You really are going to see the growth in the back half of the year. We're not anticipating a sizable drop in the first half. We're looking at it to be modestly up to flattish. But -- so then it's really a back-half story in terms of the earnings. In terms of the AP to inventory, what we have seen is the driver of that is really higher inventory levels, coupled with the timing of payments. As you look at the timing of payments, one of the things, for instance, that impacts with the 53rd week, it then pulls in the week 1 rent payment. So as we look further, we expect inventory levels to normalize. As you look at -- in Q4, we saw our inventory per store dropped in half. It went -- it was 14% on a per store basis, which was about half the growth rate we saw in the previous period -- or previous quarter. And again, it reflects the same drivers that's really the product cost inflation and a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in NCI as we completed the rollout of that. Important thing to note here is it is seasonal goods -- or it's early receipt of seasonal goods or was there other driver. But it's important to note that these are evergreen-type products, which aren't time-sensitive. So we feel really good about the quality of the inventory, the ability to move through that and expect this to continue to normalize as we move through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : I also wanted to ask on CapEx. So historically, CapEx has been about 3% of sales. And last year and this year, it's about 4%. So just want to get a sense of where you think the normal level of spending could be in a normalized environment as a percent of sales or any other commentary? John Garratt : Sure. Again, getting back to the capital, a big driver of that was the inflation as well as the stepped up real estate and the number of projects we're doing in terms of DCs, working on three DCs in one quarter. So again, feel great about the returns of these. I don't want to speculate on -- and give future guidance on CapEx. Could see an environment where with the inflation coming down, it would moderate that. But more to come in terms of the CapEx, but what we are really focused on is the returns of these and feel great about the returns and we'll see what's required to grow the business going forward, but more to come. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So DG Media, the commentary is very positive there in terms of what you're seeing with your vendors. As you think about the dollars there, how do you think about reinvesting the business versus flowing that through the bottom line? Jeffery Owen : Rupesh, you're right. We are very excited about what we're seeing on our DG Media Network. And quite frankly, our digital acceleration in general. One of the things that we've learned over the last couple of years when we started this journey was how digitally savvy our customer is and how much it helps her to be more connected and more loyal to Dollar General and it shows up in her ability to spend with us. Certainly, as you think about the network and you think about what we're able to bring to the market, we're able to bring access to a segment of the population that's really difficult to connect with. And when you think about the rural population, 30% of the United States population, that's meaningful. And that's why our brand partners and our CPG partners are very excited to partner with DG, and we're excited about where the media network will go over time. In terms of kind of how we handle the dollars that we're receiving from that, obviously, one of the things that's great about this company is our ability to grow our operating profit and reinvest in the business. And this is one of the ways it allows us to do that. And so that's why we're all very excited about the strategic foundation we've built here, the muscle we've built. And we're excited about some of the initiatives that we're going to bring to the forefront as we look forward, especially in '23 and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Karen Short : And John, sad to see you go. It's been great working with you. I just wanted to go back to the overall algorithm for DG. Obviously, there's noise in '23, and we all appreciate that. But can you just maybe give a little bit of an update on what you think the long-term algorithm should be as we get beyond '23? And then I wanted to just clarify on the wage investment and/or wage. Can you just let us know what your average hourly wage rate is? And how you think about that as opposed to investing more in dollars, and I realize you need to invest in hours, but dollars? Jeffery Owen : Yes, it's Karen. I'll take the first part of that question, and then John, I'll kick it to you for the algorithm question. But Karen, we don't disclose our average hourly rate. But what I can tell you is, as I said earlier, is we have and we continue to pay very competitive wages. And I think the one nuance to Dollar General that I frankly believe is underappreciated is the ability to come into this company as a part-time sales associate and grow into a career. .  And you can do it faster than you can in any other retailer because we're committed to internal development, and we have the opportunity to provide you with growth opportunities because of our dynamic growth.  So I think those two things are the reason why we feel great about our staffing levels, our ability to attract and our ability to retain our talent. And so that's why we're investing in hours. And right now, we're very pleased to see that wage grow 23% over the last 3 years. So we're in a great position, and that's why we're able to put this investment more towards the hours in the store rather than having to catch up on wages. And John? John Garratt : As you think of the algorithm and if you just step back and look over the last 3 years, while it's been up and down over the last 3 years in this environment, every element of that well in excess of the algorithm. If you look at sales comp, well in excess of the algorithm; expansion of gross margin and operating margin; operating income, EPS, well in excess of the algorithm. So we feel very good about the performance over this period of time, and we feel the model remains very strong and very resilient. We continue to see ourselves as 10%-plus EPS growers over the long term, not every year. Some years, we see it prudent to invest to protect that growth over the long term. But if you look at the business model and fundamentals, they're very strong with the unique combination of value and convenience resonating as strong as ever. We continue to see very compelling store-level economics in new store returns and then significant bumps from the remodels. And we continue to see 16,000-plus new store opportunities for everybody in our space. But obviously, we've been getting an outsized share of that. So significant runway for growth. The initiatives are performing very well, helping both the top line and bottom line. They're focused on both. And we see, as I mentioned, a lot of levers within gross margin to continue to expand that over the long term. And the business generates a lot of cash to then buy back shares and reinvest in the business. So we think top to bottom, the business model and fundamentals remain very strong. Karen Short : So is it fair to say or reasonable to think that, that's more of a '24 return? I mean I know you haven't given guidance, but just some... John Garratt : I don't want to give specific guidance, but I would just say we feel very good about the future and the strength of the business. Operator : Our final question is Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Corey Tarlowe : And congrats, John, on your retirement announcement. It's been a pleasure to work with you. My first question for Jeff on market share. You talked in your prepared remarks about seeing customers trade in the Dollar General. You talked about higher income consumers trading down to Dollar General. So I think it's clear that Dollar General is gaining share across income cohorts and categories, and you talked about Value Valley as well, comping up over, I think it was 30%. So maybe could you talk a little bit more about where you think this market share is coming from? And where you see it likely to come from even more so as we look ahead? Jeffery Owen : Well, Corey, first of all, we are very pleased at the market share gains that we've been able to achieve, both on the consumable and on the nonconsumable segments of our business. And when you think about our customers as well, we're also incredibly pleased with the fact that we were able to increase our productivity with really all segments of our core customer.  We increased our share of wallet, our share of trips. Those are all really encouraging signs and very pleased to see that. It's a credit to our team and their ability to connect with this customer, bring an assortment that she's looking for and delivered in a consistent fashion. As you think about the donors, it's really the same donors we've had for quite some time, primarily drug is our biggest share donor. And so as we look forward to continuing to refine our assortment, our strategic initiatives, really allow us to really bring even more, we believe, relevant assortment to our customer. We think we're in the early to mid-innings on many of these initiatives when you think about our treasure hunt with NCI, when you think about DG Fresh and the relevance of the perishable and frozen offering, you think about produce. And we're very pleased on our digital strategy that's allowing us to, quite frankly, through our first-party data, our ability to understand this customer on an even greater level than we ever have before, we'll be able to continue to bring the relevance she's looking for. And when you think about our growing store base, we continue to see our share opportunity very, very optimistically, and we would expect us to continue to take it from the same donors we've seen in previous. Corey Tarlowe : Great. And then just a follow-up for John. So it sounds like there's a couple of moving parts in terms of the gross margin, specifically as you look out over this year, and I recognize it's a first half, second half story, but could you maybe stack rank the drivers that you anticipate from maybe most important to least important, to be affecting the gross margin line this year? I recognize mix shift is also a fairly prevailing factor in this. So how does that also factor into how you're thinking about the consumables mix shift as we look ahead for the next 12 months? John Garratt : Yes. As you think of the headwinds and the tailwinds, I'll start with the headwinds, but then go to what we see as a pretty sizable tailwind -- tailwinds. The ones we talked about were one, sales mix, that pressure continuing. So we've assumed that. We've also assumed shrink and damages as we move through the first half, in particular. And then increased markdowns, and that's really just getting back to rates more in line with historical norms. I wouldn't say of these one really stands out significantly over the others, but they all contribute as headwinds. And then, again, the shrink and damages more of a first half pressure than back half as we see it now. Damages, in particular, Q1 pressure as you look at the cadence of the year. We mentioned the LIFO impact, and we do think that will provide some benefit, but I wouldn't flow the whole thing through because you had the pricing that went with that last year. But then as you think of the tailwinds, the biggest one I would point to and the biggest overall driver I would point to here is the supply chain. We expect a pretty material benefit from lapping the increased supply chain expenses in the second half of last year as well as the sizable benefits from greater distribution center capacity and productivity, lower carrier rates as well as the benefit of expanding our private tractor fleet, which we're growing from 1,600 tractors at the end of last year to over 2,000 by the end of next year. And again, as we make those conversions, it's about a 20% savings in addition to other benefits that we expect as we optimize DG Fresh, NCI, and then expect a pretty sizable benefit from DG Media Network to name a few. And then obviously, we intend to leverage our scale as we have as a limited SKU operator, and that's another lever amongst the other levers we've mentioned in the past. So again, as you look at the guide for the year, we gave the top line, the bottom line, we didn't give gross margin, but I think it implies a pretty healthy operating profit growth than rates overall despite pretty sizable investment in the business. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jeff Owen for closing comments. Jeffery Owen : I'd like to thank you all for your questions and your interest in Dollar General. And while our operating environment is dynamic for our customer and business, we are staying focused on the things that we can control, which is continued innovation and execution in our business. If I could summarize our discussion today, I'd like to leave you with these three things. First, we have a powerful growth strategy. Second, we are investing in the future. And third, we are doing this while also planning to deliver strong results in 2023. We're excited about this business, and I am confident we are well positioned to serve our customers and also create value for our shareholders in the year ahead. Thank you for your listening today, and I hope you have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Donna, and I'll be our conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General, First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, May 30, 2024. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Walker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Kevin, you may begin your conference. Kevin Walker : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today, are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and Kelly Dilts, our CFO. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at investor.dollargeneral.com under News and Events.

You should not unduly rely on forward looking statements which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call, unless required by law. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. To allow us to address as many questions as possible in the queue. Please limit yourself to one question. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining the call. We are pleased with our start of the year, and I want to recognize the great work of our entire team as they have fully embraced our plan to get back to the basics at Dollar General. On today's call, I will begin by recapping some of the highlights of our Q1 performance, as well as sharing an update on some of our plans for 2024. After that, Kelly will share the details of our Q1 financial performance as well as our current outlook for Q2 and the full year, and then I will wrap up the call with an update on our work in getting back to the basics across the business. Turning to our first quarter performance. Net sales increased 6.1% to $9.9 billion in Q1 compared to net sales of $9.3 billion in the last year's first quarter. These results included accelerated market share growth in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales, as well as market share growth in dollars in non-consumable product sales. We opened 197 new stores during the quarter and are excited about our ability to continue to expand the number of communities we serve. Same store sales increased 2.4% during the quarter, which was above the top end of our Q1 guidance. We believe this result is a testament to the relevance of Dollar General in our communities and the ongoing positive impact of our back to basics work. The comp sales increase was driven by strong growth in consumer traffic of more than 4% and was partially offset by decline in average transaction amount, primarily driven by fewer items per basket. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by strong growth in our consumable category by customers relied on us for the value of the items they need most often for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. From a cadence perspective, growth was strongest in March, including a benefit of Easter moving from April into March this year, and was relatively similar in the months of February and April. We believe the softness in sales in the discretionary category during Q1 is a reflection of the continued pressure our core customers feel on their spending. They continue to be very value oriented in their shopping behavior, which we see manifested in accelerated share growth in private brand sales, as well as increased engagement with items at or below the $1 price point. Importantly, we continue to do well with our core customers while growing with middle and higher income trade-in customers from adjacent cohorts. We continue to feel very good about our pricing position relative to competitors and other classes of trade, and our value proposition presents significant opportunity for ongoing growth among a wide range of customers. Looking ahead, we expect value to continue to be the most important consideration for customers in multiple income ranges. We know that our customers need us even more when they face economic challenges, and we are well positioned to help them stretch their dollar. Before I turn the call over to Kelly, I want to provide a brief update on our shrink reduction efforts, including the changes to our self-checkout strategy that we announced in March. Shrink continues to be the most significant headwind in our business, and we are deploying an end-to-end approach to shrink reduction across the organization, including efforts in our supply chain merchandising and within our stores to help combat issues around shrink. Our supply chain teams are primarily focused on ensuring deliveries are on time and in full, and our merchants on reducing the amount of inventory we carry. Within our stores, we are focusing on delivering a more consistent front end presence, broaden in the reach of our high shrink planograms, which include the removal of high shrink SKUs and the elimination of self-checkout in the vast majority of stores. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we converted approximately 9,000 stores away from self-checkout during the quarter following the quick and successful conversion of these stores in Q1, and given the ongoing challenge from shrink, we converted approximately 3,000 additional stores away from self-checkout in May, bringing us to approximately 12,000 conversions completed in total. While this represents a significant change in our stores, we believe this is the right course of action to drive increased customer engagement, while also better positioning us to begin reducing shrink in the back half of \u201824 with a more material positive impact expected in 2025. Moving forward, we plan to have self-checkout options available in a limited number of stores, most of which are higher volume and low shrink locations. Overall, we are pleased with the results and progress across the business during the first quarter, which I will discuss in more detail later. We have a lot of opportunity ahead of us, and this team is excited about the work we are doing. We have a long history of serving customers in a variety of economic environments, thanks to our distinctive combination of value and convenience. I also want to note that we recently published our annual servings others report, which provides several important updates on our ongoing ESG efforts and goals. We recognize the great responsibility we have as an essential partner to the communities we call home and are excited about the many ways we are able to serve our customers, associates, communities, and shareholders, and with everyday low prices in store locations within five miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. We are uniquely positioned to serve customers and communities across the country. We remain focused on getting back to the basics of Dollar General as we look to enhance the way we serve customers, further develop and support our associates and create a long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Kelly. Kelly Dilts : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I'll start with gross profit. For Q1, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.2%, a decrease of 145 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increases in shrink and markdowns, a greater consumable sales mix and lower inventory markups. These were partially offset by a lower LIFO provision. Shrink continues to be our most significant headwind and with 59 basis points worse in the first quarter compared to prior year. As Todd noted, we are taking multiple actions aimed at reducing shrink, and I'll discuss our expectation for this headwind for the remainder of the year in just a bit. With regards to markdowns, we're seeing promotional levels more similar to 2019 levels as we anticipated coming into the year. As Todd noted, customers are seeking value and we saw strong take rates on promotional items during the first quarter. Turning to SG&A, it was 24.7% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 97 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by retail labor, depreciation and amortization, incentive compensation and repairs and maintenance. Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the first quarter decreased 26.3% to $546 million. As a percentage of sales operating profit was 5.5%, a decrease of 242 basis points. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $72 million compared to $83 million in last year's first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% and compares to 21.8% in the first quarter last year. This higher rate is primarily due to the effect of certain rate impacting items on lower earnings before taxes and expense recognition attributable to stock-based compensation. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 29.5% to $1.65, which exceeded the high end of our internal expectations. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $6.9 billion at the end of Q1, a decrease of 5.5% compared to prior year and a decrease of 9.5% on a per store basis. Notably, total non-consumable inventory decreased 19.1% compared to last year and decreased 22.5% on a per store basis. The team continues to do great work reducing our overall inventory position, while simultaneously optimizing our mix and driving higher end stocks. We're pleased with the significant progress on this important goal, which not only frees up more cash in the business, but also helps to mitigate further shrink risk. And importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory remains good. The business generated cash flows from operations of $664 million during the quarter, an increase of 247% as we improved our working capital primarily through inventory management. Total capital expenditures were $342 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations distribution and transportation projects, and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $130 million. Overall, we're pleased with our progress and proud of these results, including gains in customer traffic and market share, significantly lower inventory levels, and improved cash flow from operations. Moving to our financial outlooks for fiscal 2024, while it's still early in the year, we believe our positive first quarter results reinforce the importance of our stores to the communities we serve, as well as the progress of our back to basics work. With that in mind, we're reiterating our financial guidance for 2024 and continue to expect net sales growth in the range of approximately 6% to 6.7%, same store sales growth in the range of 2% to 2.7% and EPS in the range of $6.80 to $7.55. This guidance continues to assume an estimated negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.50 due to higher incentive compensation expense and an effective tax rate in a range of approximately 22.5% to 23.5%. We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. We continually evaluate and seek to optimize the use of this capital, and as a result we have updated our expectations for real estate projects in 2024. We now expect to remodel approximately 1,620 stores this year compared to our previous expectation of 1,500 remodels. To facilitate this increase in remodels, we're reducing the number of planned new stores to 730 compared to our previous expectation of 800 new stores. We continue to expect to relocate 85 stores. In total, this increases our expected total real estate project count from 2,385 to approximately 2,435. We're excited about this increase in projects and the expanded investment in our mature stores, and we believe this is an appropriate reallocation of our capital. As a reminder, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and we believe they continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base, as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. Next, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio is currently above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment grade credit ratings, which as a reminder are BBB and Baa2. Now let me provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook for 2024. Our customer continues to be very value driven and we anticipate they will continue to be price sensitive as we move through the year. With this in mind, we expect sales mix pressure to be above our original expectation, and as I mentioned earlier, we have seen and continue to expect the promotional environment reversion to pre pandemic levels as we move throughout 2024. As such, we expect our promotional markdown headwinds to gross margin will continue at least through the first half of the year. As Todd noted, shrink is currently trending worse than we initially expected coming into the year, and we now expect this headwind to be greater in 2024 than what was originally contemplated in the financial guidance we provided on our earnings call in March. We're taking aggressive and decisive action to mitigate this challenge, and we're expecting to see improvement later in the back half of 2024 than we had previously anticipated and more significantly into 2025. Turning to SG&A, our expectations are relatively unchanged from what we previously provided on our Q4 call. We continue to anticipate a significant headwind this year from the normalization of incentive compensation in 2024, as well as an ongoing headwind from depreciation and amortization, while we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, given the somewhat atypical cadence of this year and some of its specific headwinds, we're providing more detail on our expectations for the second quarter. To that end, we expect comp sales to increase in the low 2% range in the second quarter with EPS in the range of approximately $1.70 to $1.85. In summary, we're pleased with the solid start to our year, including exceeding our top and bottom-line expectations for first quarter. We believe our actions are resonating with our customers, strengthening our competitive position and reinforcing our foundation for future growth. We remain committed to maintaining our discipline in how we manage expenses and capital as a low cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We continue to believe that this model is resilient and strong. We're excited about the long-term future of this business, including plans to drive profitable, same store sales and meaningful operating margin growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow, and long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Kelly. Our focus continues to center on our four key operating priorities of driving profitable sales growth, capturing growth opportunities, leveraging and reinforcing our position as a low cost operator and investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment, and inclusion. As we have discussed to advance these priorities in the near term, we have implemented a refreshed approach to getting back to the basics to enhance store standards and the associate and customer experience in our stores. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on these efforts in our supply chain, stores and merchandising. I will start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customers. As a reminder, we have prioritized increasing the employee presence at the front end of our stores to provide a friendly welcome and elevated level of engagement to our customers, while also facilitating a positive checkout experience. As we have continued to move away from self-checkout in the majority of our stores, we believe this focus is even more important in serving our customers and supporting our sales growth. We have additionally focused more of our labor hours on perpetual inventory management in our stores by adding specific inventory management shifts and specified and specialized inventory training in each store. Our customers are taking note of these efforts as we have seen a significant improvement in their perception of our in-stock levels, which we believe is contributing to our growth in customer traffic, market share, and comp sales. Finally, we have also taken a significant action to make it easier to operate our stores while also enhancing the overall experience for associates and customers. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have made significant strides in serving our stores. In addition to the work we have done in the field, such as reducing district manager\u2019s fans of control, simplifying and eliminating certain activities and reducing inventory. We continue to focus on reducing store manager turnover, which is correlated to sales and shrink results in our stores. Notably, while we still have work to do, we are seeing year over year reductions in turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager, and sales associate. We are proud of this progress and excited to see our actions resonating with our team in the field. Overall, we believe the actions in our stores will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including customer service and on shelf availability and convenience. Enhance the associate experience in the stores including improved employee engagement and retention, and drive improvements in financial results, including sales and shrink. Next, let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on time and in full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF. Our distribution and transportation teams have taken aggressive action to improve their service to our stores, and these efforts have led to significantly higher OTIF levels compared to the same time last year. When we began our back to basics work last year, we identified an opportunity to exit 12 temporary warehouse facilities, which would lower cost and improve inventory flow throughout our supply chain. Since that time, we have exited seven of these buildings and are in and on track to exit the remainder in 2024. In conjunction with these moves, we are making great progress on our permanent distribution centers in Arkansas and Colorado, both of which are scheduled to open later this year, and which should contribute to a reduction in stem miles and lower transportation cost over time. Finally, we have also begun the first full scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers, since the launch of our Fast Track initiative in 2017. Work has begun on all 18 of our dry facilities with four already completed. We are making quick progress on the others and believe we will finish this work by the end of the year. Once we conclude the resort process, we believe our store teams will be able to restock shelves more quickly, ultimately driving greater on shelf availability for our customers and increase sales. Ultimately, we believe these actions will enhance the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while driving greater efficiencies and a further improved experience for our store teams and customers. Finally, I want to provide an update on getting back to basics and merchandising. Our team's top priority is always delivering value to the customer, and we continue to innovate on ways to provide the products they want and need at affordable prices. These basics are important to our customer, which is why we remain committed to a strong private brand offering affordable national brands and the $1 price point. Despite the inflationary pressures we have experienced over the last year, we continue to carry approximately 2000 items at or below the $1 price point in the majority of our stores as we help our customers stretch their dollar in our stores each and every day. As Kelly noted, we also continue to focus on meaningfully reducing our inventory position, and the team has done an outstanding job on this front over the past six months. In 2024, we committed to a net reduction of up to 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of this year, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal. We have already made good progress selling through the remaining inventory and resetting planograms to remove these items from our stores. Importantly, we expect a significant portion of the sales of these secondary and tertiary SKUs will transfer to primary SKUs that will remain in our offering. Finally, our merchants have been working with our operators to identify and execute on simplification opportunities such as reducing the number of floor stands and monthly end cap resets to reduce activities for our store teams. In conjunction with the work of our supply chain teams to optimize the sorting process. Our merchants are also working to increase the number of products that can go straight to the shelf, eliminating the need for extra touches within the store. Collectively, these actions are designed to save time in our stores for our teams, and ultimately result in an improved associate and customer experience. As we wrap up this morning, I want to say again, how proud I am of the team's great work and commitment to getting back to basics as we fulfill our mission of serving others. We are moving with great urgency to implement our back to basics plan and execute on the things that matter most to our customers. And while we are pleased with the positive results, stemming from many of these actions, we recognize that some of our efforts may take longer to deliver the intended benefit, and we'll continue to work to capitalize on these opportunities. I want to thank our more than 186,000 employees for their ongoing engagement and their passion for our customer. This team is energized and confident in our strategy, both near term to restore operational excellence and long term to deliver value for our customers and shareholders alike. I look forward to all that we can accomplish together throughout 2024. With that operator, we will now open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Lasser : It's a multi-part question. First, why is shrink worse than you expected? And how have you been able to offset that while still being able to maintain your full year EPS guidance? And similarly, you mentioned that the promotional environment has gotten more intense. That's not surprising. Given all the announcements from competitors who've talked about price investments, what risk does that create to your margins in the second half of the year as you might have to respond to what's happening in the marketplace? Todd Vasos : On shrink, I just want to make sure we referenced back to last quarter as we rolled out our back to basics program in earnest over the last few months. We talked about last quarter that some areas will take a little longer to manifest itself in a real positive manner. We called out shrink as being one of those because shrink has the longest tail to it. And quite frankly, we have many levers on shrink that we watch. And we look at each and every quarter. In saying that, the great thing here is that what we're seeing on the shrink front right now is what we thought we would. And that is of the shrink indicators that we watch. And by the way, we use a proprietary predictive model to look at this. We've had this for many years and as you know, over the years, our shrink indicators will would have indicated and have performed in a pretty good manner up until recently. And these predictive models are now flashing green or positive with the majority of the items that we look at for shrink. So in saying that, in a nutshell, we feel pretty good about what that would indicate for the back half of the year, and what that will indicate hopefully for \u201825 and beyond, just like we thought it would. It would come together a little softer in Q1, but again, green shoots, which is really great to see starting to perform. And Kelly, you may want to just mention how it affects the margin overall. Kelly Dilts : No, absolutely. So it takes a little while for some of that improvement to show up in our financial results, which is why we're calling it out. So we do expect to see improvement in the second half of the year and even more meaningfully into 2025 as we work through that. I think your other question was just what are we doing to work to offset any of those risks? And I'll tell you, we have a lot underway as we typically do, where our goal is always to improve margins. And so, some of the underlying drivers that we still have in place as we work through the shrink piece include DG Media network. So, looking for some meaningful contribution there. We still have private brands which generate better margins than some of the national brands, and it's certainly something that our consumer is looking for now. We have got global sourcing category management, which is just huge here at Dollar General. And certainly, a way to offset any of the risks that we see in the near term. And then of course, inventory optimization, which the team has done just a fantastic job of focusing on and finally supply chain efficiencies. Certainly, we are continuing to look for those efficiencies as we move through this year and frankly as we move through each and every year. So I think with all of those underlying drivers and just delivering on our back to basics actions on driving sales and lowering shrink, we feel good that we're strengthening that foundation for the long term and into the back half of the year. Todd Vasos : And then Michael, I know you had a second part question and as it relates to the promotional activity and what we're seeing from that, as you may recall, we were probably one of the first ones to call out that we believe that the promotional environment would rise in 2024. We made mention that we believe it's going to be more reminiscent to free COVID times, so 2019 type levels, and quite frankly, in Q1, that's exactly what we saw. And we still see it, the same way, today as we move through Q2 and into the back half of the year. So, it's pretty much right on what we thought. And I would tell you that for us, here at Dollar General, we've always done a very good job, as of balancing that everyday value here on the shelf meeting our everyday price, and then seeding in that promotional activity to really show even more value to the consumer. We do that probably as good as anyone. And the great thing about Dollar General is that category management that Kelly just mentioned where we are a large player with almost every CPG company in America. And with that, allows us the opportunity to continue to work with them very closely to help mitigate margin risks from that promotional activity. So we feel good. Everything is contemplated in our guidance, as we move forward. And we feel good about that promotional activity to show good value to the consumer. And it's been resonating. Take a look at our sales for the quarter and our transactions for the quarter. I think the balance is being struck very well here. Operator : The next question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So Todd, maybe could you elaborate on customer behaviors that you saw as the first quarter progressed as we think about consumables relative to discretionary maybe what comp trend have you seen so far in May relative to your load two second quarter guidance? And then just larger picture, where does the back to basics strategy stand today relative to the overall opportunity? Thinking about near term opportunities, and then as you said, things that just may take a little bit longer. Todd Vasos : Matt, what we're seeing from the consumer overall is what we pretty well called out in March, and that is, it's a cautious consumer, I think is the best way to put it. She has definitely flea the value, especially in the lower income stratas. But what we're seeing, like we saw in Q4 what we're seeing is that the next cohort and the one above that, so let's call it middle to upper middle income, and then in some of the upper income stratas, we're seeing the trade down still come in. So we feel good that we're getting new customers in. We can see it in our data, and that we're retaining at a high level those core customers of ours in that lower income strata. She is definitely making trade-offs in the store and at the shelf. And feeding her family and taking care of her family is her number one priority. Inflation has and continues to be top of mind for her. While she does say in our recent work, as you know, we go out each quarter and talk to the consumer. In our recent work, she does indicate, overall year over year, the inflation has slowed down, but what she keeps pointing out is that the inflation that has happened to her over the last couple years is still there. It hasn't gone away. So it's in the base, if you will. And as we had pointed out a couple quarters ago, we don't believe that that is probably going to dissipate as we continue to move forward. So our core consumer is still continuing to figure out her overall spending rates. Now, the great thing and as your second question asked was that consumable versus non-consumable mix. And what we saw in Q1 is in those times when the consumer wants to spend more, let's talk about Easter for a moment. We saw Easter was very good for us both on the consumable and the non-consumable side of that discretionary side of the equation. So, she has the ability to spend some, but she's very deliberate with that spend. And so we need to continue to show her value even in the discretionary areas. So what that signals to us is that she continues to figure out her income levels because she is spending on some of that discretionary. So we'll continue to foster that as we move through Q2 and beyond. And we believe it's fully contemplated in our low twos guidance that we gave in Q2. And then lastly, on our back to basics work. Thanks for asking that because we're proud of what we've done so far. If you recall, we talked about starting at about our own 20 yard line. If I can revert back to my football analogy for a moment, I would tell you that we're at or just crossing the 50 yard line now as we exited Q1, that's quite a move very quickly, I would tell you, and you asked a few of the components are moving even quicker. So I would tell you in our supply chain, very happy with what we're seeing there. Has moved well past the 50 and probably more on the 40 yard line on the other side of the field. So feeling very good about that. Our on time and in full rates have been very stable and top-notch for many weeks now. And that stability is really the key. If you remember me saying that last time, that consistency is where the stores start to feel it and the customers feel it the most. And we're starting to see that, materialize and have been for the last few weeks. As it relates to our merchandising side, I would tell you we're squarely across the 50 as well with some of our biggest components yet to come in Q2 and in the into early Q3, all the pipe has been laid for that. And we are already starting to see some of that benefit as we worked in the Q2 here. And then our operations inside of our stores and our field. I'm very proud of what they've done so far, because everything we've done back of house is now starting to manifest itself at store level. And so, I would tell you that we're squarely on the 50 yard line there as well. And I know that the team is squarely focused on moving the ball down the field in Q2 there. And I believe that, with the back of the house indicators that we see right now, I believe that that's going to happen as we move forward. Shrink is still, as we indicated probably the laggard there. We knew it would be the laggard. This is not a surprise. A little worse than we thought in Q1, but overall, not a surprise that it's going to tail everything else. But again, those green shoots I mentioned earlier really give us the confidence to reiterate our guidance for full year, because we're starting to see some of that occur. And of course, those positive sales and transactions, I don't want to minimize that. You have to take a look at that and be very positive, because the consumer is seeing the difference inside of our stores. A big difference in turn over the last couple quarters. So stay tuned. We feel pretty good. You could probably tell by my enthusiasm and the voice that we're seeing some real positives from all the work that we're doing Matt. Operator : The next question is coming from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : The change in the real estate plan. Just wondering if you could talk through why you're changing it at this point in time and longer term. Is this something maybe we should expect in terms of breakdown for real estate priorities between refreshes remodels and new store growth? Kelly Dilts : Yes, thanks for the question, Kate. And just to level set everyone. So we are reducing the number of new stores this year. It's by about 70 stores, and what we're going do is move them into 2025. So we feel really good about the locations that we have identified. We're just pushing them out into to 2025. And what that does is free up capital in order to increase the number of remodels and the total real estate project count that we have. So I have to tell you, we're really excited about this increase in projects with the expanded investment particularly in our mature stores. And we think this is absolutely the appropriate reallocation of capital, especially with our back-to-basics work. And so, stay tuned for 2025, but for right now, we feel really good about this reallocation. Operator : The next question is coming from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : My question is on longer term margins and Todd, we've talked about getting back north of seven over time. You've gotten now six months of reflecting on the business and there's some things that are there, puts and takes at the margin, maybe some things that are a little bit worse on margin shrink and promos. Do you think that level, now that you have six months of seeing how the business and the environment looks, those levels of margin are appropriate given what you are reinvesting? And then maybe a slightly different second part of the question. The consumers that you mentioned are buying more in promotion. How does that foot now with retailers actually investing in price? I'm sure you're watching it closely, but how do you think about that in the need to not just promote, but actually make structural and price investments? Todd Vasos : Let me actually answer the second one first and I'll turn it over to Kelly for your first question. Again, the promotional environment is nearly exactly what we thought it would be. A little higher in Q1, but I would tell you that we knew this is the way the consumer was going to react. And we knew, and we said this in Q4, the way CPG would react because they're looking to move units as well. So, I would tell you that, this is probably both a CPG and a customer push into some of this promotional activity. Now, in saying that we feel great about our everyday price, as I indicated on the prepared remarks, we are right in line with everyday price against all classes of trade. We feel good about that. We continually invest in price and imp, impress and value at the shelf. And then the other thing to keep in mind is our expansive and growing private brand business has been very stable and solid, and growing quite frankly in Q1. And that important and magic $1 price point continues to be one of our best performers in the quarter. So we're showing value at all different spots for the consumer. And it's resonating. I mean, when you look at that transaction growth across Q1, I think, one would say it's resonating heavily with the consumer at this point. So we feel good about all of our pricing across the board, but we continue to watch it. We'll continue to watch all classes of trade. We will make adjustments if need be as we move through Q2 and beyond. But right now, the customer is reacting exactly like we thought she would, we know how to do this. We've been doing this for a long time and this category management team that we have here built in 2008 continues to be strong and continues to be working all the levers that we know how to do here at Dollar General. Kelly Dilts : And just if -- as taking a look at the longer term and we talked about this just a minute ago, we're certainly doing everything with our back to basics actions to strengthen that foundation for longer term growth with driving sales and working on lowering shrink. We still feel great about the fundamentals of this business. We're growing share, we're growing traffic. We had good healthy comps. We're generating a lot of cash, so the model is absolutely intact. As we look forward, we still have a nice long way -- long runway for growth, and that that's new stores and our remodel program. So feel good about that. We feel good about generating a significant amount of cash flow and the investments that we're making in our business now as we look forward to how that will return in the future. And then of course, soon as we reach the target of our debt leverage, we'll be returning cash back to shareholders when appropriate on in the form of share repurchases. And so, given all of that, I would say that where we're at right now from an operating margin perspective, we know we have a lot of opportunity and we are always looking to improve our operating margin. You heard me talk about a lot of the longer-term levers that we have and some in the shorter term around the gross margin side of things, but we also have our save to serve approach to controlling costs, which is also a huge benefit to drive operating margin as well. So we certainly feel like we can do that from here. And I would tell you that we believe this business is going to return to a 10% to 10% plus EPS growth on an adjusted basis over the longer term. Operator : The next question is coming from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Paul Lejuez : Can you talk about the comps that you assume in the non-consumable categories for the rest of the year and how those assumptions have changed? I think you said the business mix is a little bit worse of a drag than you thought. I thought you said the same for shrink and also maybe for promos. So just curious what the offsets are there as well to help keep your guidance. Thanks. Todd Vasos : Yes, I would tell you that our non-consumer discretionary business, as I mentioned earlier, it's still alive and well. It's just the consumer is making those trade-offs in the store and at the shelf. But I would tell you again, during those important times when discretionary is important to her family, she has the ability to spend. So that shows you that and gives us confidence that we have the right products for the consumer at the right value and price. And as we continue to move through Q2 and beyond, we believe layering in some promotional activity and discretionary, like we are in our core non-consumable areas, excuse me, was -- is probably the right thing to do. So we believe a nice balance of both will help the consumer stay engaged in the discretionary side of the business. I have seen, looked at seen and are am very pleased with the holiday lineup we've got coming up. I know it's a little premature, but it never is when we start talking about holiday because it has such a long lead time coming in. And the lineup we have this year is very strong for the back half of the year as well. So more to come. I believe we've got all the right building blocks in place for the discretionary side of the business to continue to get healthier and healthier as we move through the back half of the year. Operator : The next question is coming from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So just going back to the commenter on the failure guidance, so it implies a pretty strong second half profit recovery. So I just want to get a sense of the confidence and driving the acceleration in the key drivers as you guys look out to the back half of the year. Kelly Dilts : Yes, thanks Rupesh. I would say we are certainly pleased to be able to reiterate our guidance that we gave and to your point, it does indicate a stronger back cap and we really see the momentum of our actions on all of our back to basic work. We'll fuel that back half and looking forward to a strong top line and bottom-line growth in the back half. Operator : The next question is coming from Seth Sigman of Barclays. Seth Sigman : Despite the comment about shrink being worse than expected, it sounds like answer to prior question is that it was only a little bit worse. And then there was also another comment about your internal models flashing green. So I'm trying to reconcile all of that, but I guess my real question is around the level of investment required to address shrink, which has been a concern in the market, just cost of doing business going higher. So how confident are you that the investments you're making and including what you've done from a payroll perspective is really fully baked in here and is not going to have to step up again? Todd Vasos : Yeah, I just want to reiterate shrink was worse than we thought. It would've been in Q1 but we are seeing those green shoots, which gives us confidence to reiterate our guidance long term. Just want to make sure, we got that point across. But I would tell you that as it relates to all the work we're doing around back to basics, it will continue, we believe, to gain momentum. Everything would show that and many, many of those opportunities that we have to gain momentum directly affect the shrink line. As Kelly indicated, and I also indicated earlier, when you look at inventory levels across the store, I mean a pretty aggressive but impressive reduction in inventory in light of rising sales. And so when you think about that with a 9.5% reduction in per store inventory in 22.5% on our non-con business or discretionary business, we believe all those actions will help that shrink line because too much inventory or over inventory in some instances always leads to additional shrink. So we continue to watch that carefully. Now, the great thing is our inventory is in really good shape as far as the quality and always has been. But we want to make sure that at store level, that it gets to the shelf when it comes in and it gets in front of the consumer as quickly as possible and those levels are so important to make sure that happens. And then as I look at other levers and all the other work we're doing, the expense lines, as you mentioned, we feel confident on where we are today. Wage rates being the largest $150 million investment last year in wages was a strong commitment to grow that consumer awareness and grow our stores in a way that the consumer sees and resonates with. And I believe we're starting to see some of that benefit now. But when you look past that, we believe that we are -- we have the right amount at this point of labor hours inside of our stores. We also, over the many years from really store 2019 to 2023, we've seen a 30 -- over a 30% increase in our average hourly rate as well. And so we've invested there. That's what gives us confidence that we're on the right track. We continue to make those investments where we see needed. The other investment we made this year was we added 120 additional district managers. And that's very important because, again, being an ex-district manager that I was at one point, anytime, a district manager can have less span and control or is able to get to their stores more often, they're able to teach, train, develop, and most importantly solve problems at each and every store that is either his or her responsibility. So those spans of control and reducing those is very important. That should pay dividends as we move through \u201824, as those start to take hold. So we feel good about all the investments we've made. We feel that they were appropriate. We feel that they're right on track. And right now we feel good about where we are and with everything else that we could see today baked into our guidance for the rest of the year. Operator : The next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli of Truist. Scot Ciccarelli : As you guys reduce skews and consumables continue significantly outpace discretionary sales, and that certainly appears to be the case in the stores as well. How do you eventually balance out the relative growth rates of consumables versus discretionary? So you can alleviate some of that margin pressure from mix, or don't you, it just becomes more of a permanent shift in the mix. Thanks. Todd Vasos : Yes, we don't believe it's a permanent shift. And let me step back and say again, I believe we're doing exactly the right thing at the right time. You may recall over the years, I've always said we at Dollar General go with the consumer wants us to go, and right now, because of her finances, meaning with the inflation over the last couple years and those pressures that have come with that, this is where she needs us to be right now for her. And we doubled down on that, right? Because we need to take care of her. I believe you see in our comp for Q1 and our transaction growth in Q1 would all benefit what I just said. Meaning that consumer is resonating with that. Now, the thing I do want to point out is that all the work we did around our non-consumable initiatives, through the pandemic and even exiting the pandemic is still alive and well in our stores. And again, when the consumer needs the spend around discretionary right now, she has what she needs at Dollar General. It's proven. We see it, we see it in her spend. So we don't believe that this is a permanent shift. We believe it's temporary. How long we'll wait to see, again, the consumer will tell us that, but in the meantime, we'll go where she wants us to go. We'll have the right products for her that she needs to feed her family, take care of her family in the meantime, but at the same time continue to foster and grow that discretionary side of the business with either even more options and more value as we continue to move through this year and into the back half of the year standing ready and willing and able to serve her when she's ready to start spending more freely on that side. Operator : The next question is coming from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : I just wanted to dig into a little bit further the inventory side and supply chain. So on the inventory front, should we expect kind of further reductions at this point, or do you feel like you have what you need and you could start to grow inventory a little bit again. How are in stocks looking? And then just on supply chain, Todd, what's your vision there with the two additional DCs coming in line this year? When can we get kind of optimal product flow back? Kelly Dilts : So I'll start on that with the inventory question and I'll say reducing inventory still really remains a high priority for us. So we're going to focus on reducing that per store inventory. What that does is really simplifies things both upstream in the supply chain as well as in our stores. And so, we continue to look at that as a high priority. The other piece of that is really around focusing on inventory optimization. And so, we talked a little bit last quarter about some investments that we're making in technology. Those are starting to pay dividends. And so we are really looking on how to right-size the inventory over the next 12 to 18 months from just what we're carrying in the stores and making sure that we are in a better position to serve our customers from an in stock level. We are seeing in stocks. And so we are happy to do that. And I know I've had a shout out to the team a couple of quarters now, but they have just done a fantastic job of both reducing inventory and improving our in stocks. And I'll tell you all along, we have felt really good, and Todd said this earlier about the quality of our inventory, so that's really not our issue. It's really just about getting those levels down so that they're more manageable in the store and in the DCs. And again, felt great about the decreases. Todd called out the numbers, but just to reiterate, we've got a 22.5% decline in that non-consumable inventory. Just huge there. And then, if you don't mind, I'm just going to segue a little bit into cash. One thing that we did see on the inventory management side is what that did for our cash flow. So, our cash from operations was up 247% to last year. And so this is a really important driver, not only from the operations standpoint, but also just lowering our carrying costs and being really impactful to our cash. Todd Vasos : And then Kelly, I'll just add on the second part of your question. Again, as I reiterated I'll reiterate, I'm sorry. As I said, we feel good about where our supply chain is right now, and as we bring little Rock Arkansas on later this year and a little closer in our Colorado DC, it'll give us even more confidence as we move forward. Matter of fact, as we also said, out of these temporary facilities that we had we we're already out of seven of those. And the remaining five will come out in 2024. And really the catalyst there will be these two facilities that we open again in Colorado and in Little Rock, Arkansas. So again, I believe that we're well on our way. The consumer is definitely telling us in all the consumer work we've done, they're also saying they're seeing the benefit of that at the shelf, meaning finding what they need more often inside Dollar General. Are we perfect yet? No, but boy, we are light years from where we were and continue to grow that in stock level inside the store. So, all systems seem green there right now, and we continue to benefit from that in stock level and that on time levels from our supply chain. Operator : Our final question today is coming from Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisor Group. Joe Feldman : Wanted to ask, have you seen any initial green shoots, like you said, in the 12,000 stores that you've remodeled? I know 3,000 just happened in May, but like maybe the original ones that you did, I know it's only four months, but -- if removing the self-checkout has made any kind of measurable difference, I'm wondering if it's changed the flow, has it created longer lines or is it just better for the customer because they're engaged with an associate? Todd Vasos : There is no doubt we're getting positive customer feedback across the board on the 9,000 and quite frankly, some of the 3,000 that we did in May. A couple of them have many of them have been for a couple weeks now. So, we're getting that feedback. It's always positive from what we're getting, the vast majority of it from our consumers because they like the interaction at the front of the store. And with that interaction then also comes having somebody at the front of the store very visible at all times, which as you recall was not always the case in 2023. So with that should come as we continue to move through \u201824, better shrink results from that action. Now, we'll watch and see what we believe those are some of those green shoots that we'll start to see even more as you move to the back half of the year and into \u201825. But the overall, reaction from the consumer is, thank you. We like the checkout with someone that we can interact with at all times at the front. That is overwhelmingly what we get. So that really gave us that confidence if you will, to take the other 3,000 and move it to an assisted lane in May from all the good work that we saw happen from the 9,000 we did earlier in the year. And again, that consumer response, which we rely on across the board for all actions that we take, because everything starts and stops with that consumer in the store. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for today. We would like to thank you for your interest in Dollar General and your participation on today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time or log off the webcast and enjoy the rest of your day.",

Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our team for their continued dedication to serving our customers while executing our back-to-basics plan across the organization. This dedication was on full display at our leadership meeting earlier this month as we had the opportunity to host more than 1,500 leaders of our organization here at Nashville. This event served as a powerful reminder of the passion and talent of this team and the mission of serving others that unites us. On today's call, I will begin by recapping our Q2 performance, I will then share updates on our back-to-basics work as well as an update on our plans for the remainder of 2024. After that, Kelly will share the details of our Q2 financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for the full year. Turning to our second quarter performance. We continue to make important progress on our back-to-basics plan. However, we are not satisfied with our overall financial results. On the top line, net sales increased 4.2% and to $10.2 billion in Q2 compared to net sales of $9.8 billion in last year's second quarter. Importantly, despite a weaker sales environment for our core customer than we had anticipated, we continue to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales. Same-store sales increased 0.5% during the quarter, which was below our expectations. The increase was driven by a 1% growth in customer traffic and was partially offset by a 0.5-point decline in average transaction amount, which was driven by lower average unit retail price per item. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by the growth in our consumable category, as customers continue to focus their spending on the items, they need at most for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in our seasonal home and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest in June before turning negative in July. Notably, the three softest comp sales weeks of the quarter were the last week of each of the calendar months. This pattern suggests that our customers are less able to stretch their budgets through the end of the month. With that in mind, as well as our continued softness in discretionary sales in our own customer data and survey work, we believe the softer-than-anticipated sales performance in Q2 is at least partially attributable to a core customer that is less confident of their financial position. I want to provide some additional context around what we're seeing and hearing from our customers. The majority of them state that they feel worse off financially than they were six months ago as higher prices, softer employment levels and increased borrowing costs have negatively impacted low-income consumer sentiment. As a result, our core customer who contributes approximately 60% of our overall sales comes predominantly from households earning less than $35,000 annually. Inflation has continued to negatively impact these households with more than 60% claiming they have had to sacrifice on purchasing basic necessities due to the higher cost of those items, in addition to paying more for expenses such as rent, utilities and health care. More of our customers report that they are now resorting to using credit cards for basic household needs and approximately 30% have at least one credit card that has reached its limit. And in our latest survey, 25% of our customers surveyed noted they anticipated missing a bill payment in the next six months. While middle- and higher-income households are seeking value as well, they don't claim to feel the same level of pressure as low-income households. As customers have felt more pressure on their spending, we have also seen corresponding elevation in the promotional environment beyond what we had anticipated coming into the year. Importantly, we continue to feel very good about our everyday low-price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. However, the increased promotional activity has pressured both sales and gross margin, and we anticipate this will likely continue for the duration of the year. That said, we remain committed to our back-to-basics strategy, which focuses on controlling the things that we can control, including a timely and accurate supply chain, in-store execution and customer-centric merchandising. With this in mind, we have already begun taking decisive action to respond and strengthen our position over the back half of the year. I want to take the next few minutes to update you on our back-to-basics progress, which is foundational to our future. And then I will discuss the actions we are taking to build on that progress and deliver a stronger customer experience. I will start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customer. Our efforts in the stores have centered around further enhancing the customer experience to deliver the value and convenience they expect in a clean and friendly shopping environment. We have increased the employee presence at the front end of our stores, with our associates committed to providing friendly, welcome and elevated level of engagement to our customers while also facilitating the positive checkout experience. We have also focused labor hours on perpetual inventory management in our stores in an effort to significantly improve our in-stock levels and support our sales growth. These efforts have paid dividends as we continue to see year-over-year improvements in our in-stock levels. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have also contributed to the in-store progress by helping to simplify operations for our teams, which should enhance both the associate and customer experience in our stores. All of these improvements have continued to drive lower year-over-year turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager and sales associates. We are proud of the progress in the stores, and pleased to see our actions continue to resonate with our team in the field as well as with our customers. And we are working hard to continue to advance our progress and further elevate the experience within our stores. Next, let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF. Our focused efforts here have led to significantly higher OTIF levels compared to the same time last year, and we are pleased with what we have seen both in our traditional and fresh supply chains. We have also made good progress in optimizing our distribution capacity. As a reminder, we had previously announced plans to close 12 temporary facilities by the end of the year. We have already exited 11 of these buildings, and now believe we can close at least two more by the end of this year. While closing the less efficient temporary facilities, we have built and opened two new permanent distribution centers in Arkansas and Colorado. We expect both to ramp up operations in the coming months and to ultimately contribute to a reduction in stem miles and lower transportation costs over time. Finally, we are undertaking the first full-scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers since the launch of our Fast Track initiative in 2017. As a reminder, the ultimate goal of this effort is to enable our store teams to stock shelves more quickly, which should drive greater on-shelf availability for our customers and ultimately support ongoing sales growth. We have made significant progress on this front, and as planned, we are on pace to complete this work by the end of the year. Overall, we remain focused on enhancing the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while keeping costs low, driving greater efficiencies and further improving the experience for our store teams and customers. Finally, I want to provide an update on getting back to the basics of merchandising. Providing a meaningful value to our customer continues to be a top priority. We have a multifaceted approach to deliver that value, including a strong everyday low price on national and private brands, compelling promotions on sales events and low opening price points, including approximately 2,000 items at or below $1 every day. We have also continued to make strong progress reducing total inventory this year, which Kelly will discuss in more detail in a moment. In 2024, we began working toward a net reduction of approximately 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of the year, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal. Finally, our merchants have done a fantastic job working with our operators to reduce activity and simplify work inside the stores. For example, we have reduced the number of floor stands by approximately 25% through the first half of the year, and we anticipate removing more than 50% by the end of the year. Additionally, we have reduced the number of times we rotate some of our displays, allowing our store teams to spend more time engaging with our customers. Collectively, these actions are designed to save time within our stores for our teams and ultimately result in an improved associate and customer experience. Overall, we are making nice progress as you have heard, and we are executing on the goals we have set for our team. And importantly, we believe we will continue advancing these efforts as we move throughout the remainder of the year. Moving forward, we believe our back-to-basic actions will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including on-shelf availability and convenience, further enhance the associate experience in stores, including improved employee engagement and retention, and ultimately drive improvements in financial results in 2025 and beyond. However, as I previously mentioned, we are not happy with our Q2 financial results. We know the retail landscape has continued to evolve in terms of the promotional environment and financial constraints felt by our customers, and we are taking immediate action to respond to serve them, while also positioning the business for growth and value creation. With all of that in mind, we are increasing our investment in markdown activity in an effort to support our customers, further drive customer traffic and improve sales. We are investing from a strong everyday price position to further support our customer and maintain a favorable competitive positioning. We believe this investment will work in conjunction with our back-to-basic efforts to further enhance our value and convenience proposition. In summary, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with the operational progress we're making, and feel good about the actions we are taking to build on that momentum. We need to be at our best for our customers in times like this, and we are excited about the opportunity to serve them. We have a strong track record of delivering exceptional value, and we have seen that when we do so consistently, we build strong brand loyalty that contributes to healthy share gains over the long term. And with store locations within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population, we are uniquely positioned to serve customers and communities with value and convenience. I am confident this team will continue to rise to the occasion and seize the opportunities in front of us to further enhance the way we serve our customers, improve our financial results and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly. Kelly Dilts : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I'll start with gross profit. For the second quarter, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30%, a decrease of 112 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increased markdowns, increased inventory damages, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category and increased shrink. These factors were partially offset by a lower LIFO provision. With regards to markdowns, we are now seeing promotional levels greater than we had anticipated coming into the year. As Todd noted, customers are increasingly seeking value in their purchasing behavior in addition to an overall increased promotional environment. Shrink was a year-over-year headwind of 21 basis points in Q2, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. And I want to note that while shrink continues to be a significant headwind, we are pleased with the progress we're making and believe our actions, including our self-checkout conversions, are having a positive impact. Turning to SG&A. It was 24.6% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 57 basis points. The primary expenses that were greater percentage of net sales in the current year period were retail, labor, depreciation and amortization, store occupancy costs and utilities. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter decreased 20.6% to $550 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 5.4%, a decrease of 168 basis points. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $68 million compared to $84 million in last year's second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3% and compares to 22.9% in the second quarter last year. This lower rate is primarily due to the effect of certain rate-impacting items such as federal tax credits on lower earnings before taxes. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 20.2% to $1.70. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7 billion at the end of second quarter, a decrease of 7% compared to the prior year and a decrease of 11% on a per store basis. Notably, total non-consumable inventory decreased 13% compared to last year and decreased 17% on a per store basis. Importantly, we continue to believe that the quality of our inventory remains good. The team has done a nice job reducing our overall inventory position while simultaneously optimizing our mix and driving higher in-stock levels. We will continue to focus on maintaining the appropriate balance of mix of inventory to drive sales while also mitigating shrink risk and improving our working capital. The business has generated cash flows from operations of $1.7 billion year-to-date, an increase of 127% as we continue to improve our working capital position, primarily through inventory management. Total capital expenditures for the 26-week period were $696 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $130 million. Now I want to provide an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. On the top line, we've updated our guidance to reflect our second quarter results as well as our expectations that the customer will continue to feel financial pressure for the duration of the year, and the promotional environment will remain elevated beyond what we had initially anticipated. With that in mind, we now expect net sales growth in the range of approximately 4.7% to 5.3% and same-store sales growth in the range of approximately 1% to 1.6%. Turning to gross margin, we expect additional pressure as a result of the increased promotional markdown activity that Todd noted, as well as increased sales mix pressure due to the customers' need to prioritize their spending on the consumables category. With regard to damages, our guidance now assumes no improvement in the back half of the year, though we are focused on addressing this headwind through our continued emphasis on getting back to basics. And while we expect shrink to be a headwind for the full year, our results from the second quarter as well as positive trends in other metrics that are highly correlative to shrink, including inventory reductions, supporting our belief that we are moving in the right direction to continue mitigating this headwind. Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see shrink begin to turn to a tailwind later in Q4 and then become a more material tailwind in 2025. Within SG&A, we are seeing an elevated rate of maintenance expense, particularly with HVAC units and coolers during the summer months. We're taking steps in the back half of the year to be more proactive in addressing these opportunities in order to provide a more consistent customer experience across our store footprint, while also supporting ongoing sales growth. As a result, we expect incremental pressure from the increased repairs and maintenance expense to continue within SG&A in the back half of the year. Finally, we are also seeing pressure from wage rate inflation closer to approximately 4% this year, which is higher than was contemplated in our initial guidance for the year. With all of this in mind, we are updating our EPS guidance and now expect to deliver EPS in the range of approximately $5.50 to $6.20. This guidance now assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. This capital spending remains aligned with our capital allocation priorities, which continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. To that end, we remain on track to deliver on our plans of approximately 2,435 real estate projects this year, including 730 new stores, 1,620 remodels, and 85 relocations. Next in our capital allocation priorities, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment, and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio remains above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and BAA2. In summary, while we're not satisfied with the financial results for the second quarter, we are pleased with the continued progress in our back-to-basics work, and we believe we're taking the necessary actions to build on this progress and drive the business forward. We remain committed to disciplined expense and capital management as a low-cost operator, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. And we continue to believe that this model is resilient and strong. I want to emphasize that we're confident and excited about the long-term future of this business, including driving profitable same-store sales and deliver meaningful operating margin expansion while generating healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and creating long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Kelly. As we wrap up, let me say again that 2024 is about executing on our foundational back-to-basics plan, and we are pleased to be on schedule and making great progress against the goals we have previously outlined. We are confident that the actions we are taking will strengthen our foundation for the long term. This team is energized and laser-focused on our strategy to restore operational excellence while delivering value for our customers and shareholders alike. I want to close by thanking our more than 193,000 employees for their commitment to fulfilling our mission of serving others. It is a privilege to serve alongside them each and every day, and we are looking forward to all we can accomplish together in the back half of the year. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Lasser : Todd, the market is saying that Dollar General and the small box value model is to simply structurally challenge either because there's too many stores, it's not as sufficiently exposed to the online channel or not attracting enough incremental customers perhaps due to competition. So why is that wrong? And as you are trying to invest in markdown and promotions to regain customers, how do you build back the margin over time? Is it simply a function of leveraging sales growth? Todd Vasos : Thank you, Michael, and I appreciate the question. Yes, I fundamentally -- we fundamentally don't believe at all that the model is structurally challenged. But there are challenges to the business as this quarter indicated. Let me first start by saying that our new store productivity as well as our strong returns in new stores continue to serve us well. We continue to gain market share with these new store openings. And cannibalization with these new stores continue to be very much in line to where it's been historically. So, we don't believe that by slowing down to any large degree new stores would be the answer here. What we do believe is that this quarter, in particular, with a 0.5 point of comp versus last quarters of a fairly strong 2.4% comp, as I look at what transpired here, I would tell you that it appears to us very strongly that, one, this lower end consumer continues to be very much financially strapped especially as it relates to her ability to feed our families and support her families. As I look at our results throughout the quarter, I would tell you that, from our perspective, the last week of the calendar month of each of the calendar months was the weakest by far. When you couple that with private brand being as strong as it is for us, our value, value, which, as you probably recall, Michael, is our $1 or below offering inside of our store, which by the way, still 2,000 items, we've never walked away from that $1 price point. It is, by far, the strongest planogram that we have out there. And I would tell you that all those points would indicate that this is a cash strapped consumer right now, even more so than what we saw in Q1. Now what we also saw was that while we're not losing share, we're actually gaining share against all classes of trade in the consumable realm, what we did see in the quarter, which was different than last quarter, is the available share to take, if you will, out there from other cohorts. We didn't get our fair share of that. Now we didn't lose, right? We're not seeing any one competitor, mass or anywhere else, take our core customer. But what we did see was, at least in this quarter, the mass channel, especially those that are down south actually did a lot better in gaining the share that was available in the marketplace. We didn't get our fair share of that. So, what are we going to do about it? Well, it's exactly what we talked about in our prepared remarks. We go on the offense, and we've done that very successfully here over the years, Michael, as a merchant. And now as the CEO of this company, we know how to do this. And we're ratcheting that up as we speak. We believe that the share that's available out there, we have every right to get more than our fair share of that out there. So, we're working that really hard, and you heard that in our prepared remarks. So, I'd say that this box, this company and the small box in general is very much alive and well. We're just going through a little bit of a transition period and a transformation, as you know. And it's never usually a straight line to the top when you do these, right? And so, a few bumps in the road, but we feel that we know exactly how we can go about garnering that share that's available out there. And Kelly, you may want to take the second part. Kelly Dilts : Yes, absolutely. So yes, just how do we build that margin back over time? I think it's important to call out, one, you nailed it. It's a softer sales environment. So, with the top line, that does put pressure on our fixed cost leverage, specifically labor and rent and those type of things as you well know. But as Todd talked about, I think, in the near term, one is just going on the offense and taking the markdown investment that we need to take on a go-forward basis to drive sales and to be there for our customer. And to kind of put that in context, I would say that what we're looking at in this back half is going to be markdown rate to what we saw last year in the back half as well. So more than we had anticipated, but absolutely the right decision and not necessarily one that we have to think about over the long term as that can come back in line when circumstances change. The other piece of this, and we've talked a lot about it, obviously, is shrink and mix headwinds. And so, we're certainly experiencing those. Although, I think we have a lot of good news here to report on the shrink side of things starting to see that trend bend. It just takes a while to flow that through the financial statements. And then, the damage piece of this as well is putting a little pressure on the second half. But again, all the things that we're doing on a back-to-basics efforts are going to help to mitigate that as well as just having a focused team on that. So, I think those are kind of the near-term things that we'll be dealing with that will get in line. And then over the long term, our underlying long-term drivers are still in place. We still have a long runway for new store opportunities with high returns. We have higher returns with the opportunities that we have with our existing stores. And then you saw, this period, our cash from operations was up 127%. So, we are still generating a significant amount of cash flow, which gives us the ability to invest in the business. So, we feel good about the long-term potential of getting those margins back over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Gutman : I have two parts in one question. Todd, I want to ask if this transition period changes the way you think about reinvestment now going forward, thinking about all the levers of pricing and merchandising and labor, meaning that even if the business comes positive, that margins just stay subdued for an extended period of time while you get all the pieces in order. And then, the second part of it is, are there any cohorts of stores where it would make sense to rationalize them because they're under comping and/or they're margin dilutive to the overall chain? Todd Vasos : Yes, Simon, thanks for the question. And as we continue to move through this transformation period, obviously, as we said, it's never a straight line to the top. There's bumps in the road. The margin is one of those. As we've indicated right from the start, the biggest opportunity we have in the margin that's a differentiator than just a few years ago is in that shrink area. We believe we've got ample opportunity there to get our shrink back in line. As Kelly indicated in her prepared remarks, we're starting to see some benefit from all the work that we've done around that. And we still very much believe that it will turn to a tailwind as we move into Q4 and then much more substantial of a tailwind into '25. Now shrink is a constant battle, it's work every day, but it's that pick and showable work that we know how to do, and we know how to do very well here at Dollar General. The other thing I do want to point out, Simeon, is that, as we continue to move, I would tell you our back-to-basics plan has started to really show some signs of life here. And when I say that, when I look at our operations, as an example, we've been using a football analogy for the last few quarters. And I would tell you that we, across the 50-yard line last quarter in Q1, I would tell you, we're around the opponents 40-yard line at this point, which is good to see. We're making progress. We're making progress in a lot of fronts there, one being our staffing at the front ends, the reduction takeaway of the self-checkouts and moving those to assisted lanes, it was in full swing. Our customers are telling us they like it a lot more. Not surprising. They like the interaction instead of having to check out themselves. And we like what we see on that front. And I believe that's what's starting to show up on our shrink results as well in a positive manner. The other thing that we're working hard on, we're starting to see that shrink traction, as I talked about. We're also starting to see in-stocks better each and every quarter, really each and every period as we continue to move through. So, in-stocks are getting better. Our turnover inside of our stores at all levels of our operating group is getting better from our Regional Director, DM, Store Manager right down to the sales associates inside of our stores, which is usually a true testament that we're doing the right things for our employees, which in turn is normally the right thing for our customers. So, we believe that those are all green light. On our merchandising side, I'm very proud of the inventory reductions that took place on a same-store basis, especially 11% down in total inventory on a same-store basis, 16% down on a same-store basis in non-con and 7.6% decrease per store on a per store basis in consumables, all while driving greater share gains through our consumable categories. Where we're working hard is to continue to engage that consumer now through this promotional lever. We have a very strong everyday price out there. This will just lever on top of that. This will just lever on top of that. The other thing that I do want to talk about as well is that we've reduced -- in the process of reducing the 1,000 SKUs. That continues to do very well. We\u2019re well on track and we\u2019ll hit our goal by the end of this fiscal year in reducing the 1,000 core SKUs. And we're evaluating what that may look like in '25 for additional opportunities to continue to reduce that inventory level and simplify work at the store level. Off-shelf displays are down by 25%, as you heard in our prepared remarks in the first half, going to be down over 50% in the back half. And of course, all the work simplification that we've done, I think, is going to be very important. And lastly, our supply chain continues to really do well. When I think about where we are in the football field, we are down around the 30-yard line at this point, getting ready to get into the red zone here. And that is a true testament to the hard work of our supply chain, but also a cross-functional work of our operators and our merchants. Our on-time and in-full rates are exceeding our expectations into this coming quarter. And right now, what we're working on hard is making sure that we are consistent, right? Because consistency here is going to be the key. If I can deliver on time to our stores consistently, it gives them a full leg up and be able to work that seven-day workflow that we know, when executed at the store level, is a real positive for our stores in serving the customer each and every day. So, a lot of great things are going on. Yes, a little pressure on certain lines. We believe that our guidance is very prudent based on where that consumer is right now, and our transformation progress as well as where we want to make sure that we continue to drive that traffic. Very nice to see a positive 1% traffic gain still for the quarter. We're not happy with just the 1%, we're going to drive for more. But we know how to do this, Simeon. We've done it. We've proven that once we continue to back that consumer through tough times, she is there when the better times come and she is very sticky. And that's exactly how we're approaching it this time around. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Boss : Great. So, Todd, just to take the cadence of comps, maybe a step further, could you elaborate on underlying traffic versus ticket as the quarter progressed? Any concerns that are now more top of mind today relative to, call it, three months ago from your survey work on the low-income consumer? And have you seen any improvement in August comps? Todd Vasos : Yes. I don't want to talk too much about August, but I would tell you that what we've seen in -- so far in this quarter is in our guidance and feel that we're on track there. So very much I believe in that guidance that we put out there. Now I would tell you that while we're happy with the 1% that we gained on traffic. We believe there's more to gain there. And as I indicated in my first question answer there, I would tell you, Matt, that what we saw is the guys down in Bentonville are doing a pretty nice job in garnering the available traffic that's out there from other retailers. We haven't seen a deterioration on our side. But what we saw in Q1 was a greater pickup from the available share maybe from other classes of trade, grocery and drug. While we got some of it, we didn't get our fair share, at least what I would consider to be our fair share. And that's why we're attacking this and going on the offense. We believe that as we continue to be there for our customer in this regard will help us gain momentum into the back half of the year and hopefully a springboard into 2025. And Kelly, you may want to elaborate a little bit on the other side. Kelly Dilts : Yes. No, absolutely. So yes, taking a look at second quarter comps on a cadence basis, so June was our strongest month and then it started to turn negative in July. And so, what we really saw kind of in that mid-quarter time frame just a general step down, and it was all around the transaction side of things to Todd's point. So, when we think about what we are contemplating as we went into Q2, I would tell you that on the basket side, we were pretty much in line with our expectations. It was on the transaction side, which is what the teams are going to run hard after driving sales and making sure that we get the customers the value that they need right now. So that's really the cadence. The other thing I think that's really important to point out is the of each of the calendar months were the softest comp weeks of the quarter. And for us, that really indicates that she started to run out of money by the end of the month. And what we saw in some of our survey work is just that our core customer says that they're feeling worse off financially than they did six months ago. And so, again, it just goes back to the point of in this back half, making sure that we're playing offense on driving sales and taking the markdown investment that we need to do. Operator : Next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Rupesh Parikh : I have two quick ones. So first, on the guidance, is there any more conservatism than normal with this particular guide? And then, second, as you look at the promotional offers that you've done, I guess, in Q2 and then what you plan to do in the back half of the year, how is the consumer response versus your expectations versus what you typically see when you run these increased promotions and markdowns? Kelly Dilts : Thanks, Rupesh. Yes, no, to give a little bit color on the guidance, let me walk through a couple of things. I'll tell you that, in the back half, it was primarily of obviously the softer sales trends that we saw in Q2, but also the impacts associated with those sales. So that sales mix-related margin and then the markdowns that we've been talking about. There's a lot of other puts and takes that we talked about in our prepared remarks, but those are really the primary drivers. So, to that, just to give you a little bit of color on the sales side, what I'll tell you, while we're doing all the right things to strengthen our foundation through our back to basics and the markdowns that we're looking ahead for our core customer is obviously struggling. And so, this guidance really as more of a macro neutral to a slight softening of that consumer. And so, the low end of the guidance takes that into consideration. So, we are looking at it a little-different ways than what we may have historically. I think that's important to call out as well. So, on that lower end range, we're looking at a comp similar to the comp that we had in the second quarter, whereas the higher end of the range would assume that there's some acceleration. But I think it's important to unpack that a little bit. In analyzing where we're heading in the second half, the one- and two-year trends have a lot of noise in them just given the volatility that we had last year and then the recent step change that we had in the middle of the second quarter. So, if you take a step back, we think really looking at the CAGR from 2019 is probably a more relevant view. And that's for a couple of reasons. One is, it's a similar holiday schedule to 2024, which is important. It eliminates that noise of the pandemic and the stimulus as well as inflation as we've seen inflation steady a little bit this year. So, we're really using that kind of as a basis of what we're looking for. So, with that, on the high end of our '24 guide, what we're assuming now is that a stable CAGR rate to 2019 very close to what it was in Q2. So just continue kind of where we are and that the consumer and the environment don't necessarily get much worse from here. And then on the low-end side of things, it provides for some further softening on our core customers' ability to spend. And so that's how we're thinking about the potential outcomes of what we're seeing today. Todd Vasos : Rupesh, on the other part of the question, as Kelly indicated, we started to see that softening. It was really evident in the month of July. And so, with that being the last period of the quarter, we really started to ramp up our promotional cadence middle of that month, as you would imagine. It takes a little time to get moving, but not as long as it used to because we used our digital tools, which we've done a very nice job over the last many years in enhancing those. And so, we were able to go out fairly quickly with some promotional activity, which now has ramped up even further as we moved into August and will continue to ramp up as we move into the third -- end of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of this year. And I would tell you, just like we anticipated, we're seeing the response from the consumer. It was almost immediate. She continues to engage, especially with those digital tools. And I would tell you that we're really good at doing this. We've done it many times. We always said we reserve the right to invest in price, and, for us because of our great everyday low price and continue to be in a very great shape there, it's really that promotional lever that that we reserve the right. And so, we know exactly what the consumer wants and needs. We talk to her each and every quarter, and that's exactly what we're offering her right now, and we'll continue to do so. So, we believe that those promotional cadences will continue to garner more and more customers and more and more transactions as we move through this quarter and into next. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Peter Keith : Todd, in the past, you've always talked about how in tough times your customers need you even more, and certainly, this is a tough time with inflation and your core customers are suffering a bit. How come you don't think you're seeing the normal share gains or spending behavior from your customers like you have in the past? Todd Vasos : That's a great question, Peter. I would tell you a couple of things that we're noticing. First of all, what we normally say, right, is that during any step change, which we saw in Q2, to Kelly's point toward the end of Q2, especially, it takes her a few quarters to come out of that, meaning our core customer. What we also see is it takes a quarter or more for the trade-in to come in at a higher rate. Now in saying that what we've noticed is the trade-in has been slower to come in to the channel than what we had anticipated and/or have seen in the past. I believe that's -- there's a couple of reasons why. I think the main reason, and I believe this is true because it appears in every piece of data that we have is that the job market is still pretty decent, right? It's not as robust as it was, but also unemployment hasn't spiked greatly, if you will, in the last quarter or so. Normally, it takes that jolt to get the trade-in to come in at a heavier clip, if you will. Now the middle and the upper middle income are still looking for value. So, I don't want you to believe that they're not. But usually, to get them to trade-in at a higher rate, usually takes something a little bit more substantial than we've even seen to occur. I'm not suggesting I want to see that happen to customer, but we stand ready and willing to serve her when that happens. The other thing that we've noticed is more and more online activity comes from that cohort. Our core customer continues her online journey pretty much the way she was. It's pretty static, if you will. But we've noticed that middle to upper middle continues to rely on online a little bit more. And so, as that occurs, I believe the trade-in slows a little bit on that side. So, it's incumbent upon us to take a look at how we offset that piece as well. And I would tell you on that, just stay tuned. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Seth Sigman : I wanted to follow up on pricing just given the price investments and the comments about the promotional environment being worse than expected. Can you talk about how your competitive price gaps have evolved through this year; however, you look at that? And maybe just elaborate more on the actions that you're taking? How much of the assortment are you looking to mark down here, maybe the categories that you're focused on? And I guess just the last piece of that as we try to bridge the guidance, how much of that guidance change reflects those price investments? If I recall, last year, you had about $95 million of markdown impact. It sounds like you're saying something similar to that, so I just want to clarify, is that another $95 million? Todd Vasos : I'll start, Kelly, and I'll turn it over to you. I would tell you that we feel very good about our everyday price position. As a matter of fact, we track it, and we graph it, as you would imagine, every which way. And it's fairly flat to where we've been over the last many quarters against all classes of trade. So, our everyday retails are in good shape. If you recall, when I came back in, in October last year, I did call that out as one of our shining stars that I found coming back is that our everyday low price was very competitive and continues to be even to today. So that gives us great confidence and a very good springboard to launch this promotional activity that we know exactly how to do, and we've done it many times in my time here in the last 16 years to stimulate that customer and to build a bridge the end of the month for our core customer because she's running out of money. And while I'm not going to give you the exact playbook because that wouldn't be too smart, right? But I would tell you that it will be in categories mainly that really drive that traffic for us, but more so, what that customer was looking for to bridge that time. So, if you think about things like the food categories, things like cleaning and paper where she really needs us, again, to bridge her family's gap at the end of the month, those are those areas that are best suited for this type of activity. And that's exactly how we've approached it in the past and have so far approached it, and we'll continue to approach it as we move through the back half of the year. Kelly Dilts : Yes. No. And then just on the markdown investment as we're thinking about it in the back half. I'll tell you, it's not a certain dollar amount that we're considering. It's just overall level of promotion and markdowns that we need to take. So similar to kind of what I said before. What we're expecting is in that second half that the rate would be similar to last year. And then as we think about it more on a full year basis, what that does is get us back into kind of that markdown our promotional range that's very similar to where it was in 2019. And certainly, from a front half, back half perspective, the back half now would be heavier than the front half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. John Heinbockel : Two quick things. Todd, maybe how do you think about ROI of promotions? And I know a couple of years ago, you did promotions in the fourth quarter to jump start you going into the year -- the following year. And I think that lifted comps by a couple of hundred basis points. How do you think about this environment versus that? And then lastly, when I think about, right, your, -- the comp that you need to leverage expenses. I think it's still in the mid-3s. Is there an unlock -- a rolltainer-type unlock out there that can move that down materially, or we're kind of stuck with that 3% plus number? Todd Vasos : Yes, John, thanks for the question -- the two-part question. So, I'll take the first one, and I will tell you that, yes, for us, as we continue to look at that promotional lever, we always look at what that return would be. And at this point, we believe that it's our best use of our gross margin because, to your point, what we've seen in the past when we've done this, and you alluded to one of the times in the past, but there's been multiple times in, again, the 16 years that I've been here. And each of those times came out of that a stickier consumer, right? And so, the return is normally very much intact as we pull out of the heavier promotional activity when the time is right. Now a few years ago as well, as you know, we rationalized how we promote, and so we're a lot smarter today. So, utilizing that rationalization approach and tools that we have embedded now in our process, I believe, will help us in this activity to ensure, one, it's driving the most traffic that we can drive, but also secondly, it is the best use of our spend. Because what we want to be able to do is utilize us to lift all boats as well, meaning not only the promotional pieces, but within those areas that we are promoting, again, food, paper, cleaning, pet, those areas that I talked about earlier, that we see overall lifts in those categories. And that's what this rationalization of our markdowns in the past have provided for us. So, we've got a great book to follow there. And then as it relates to the labor side, labor rates are up a little higher than we anticipated this year. The hours that we're providing is right on what we thought. We still feel very good about the hours that are available to our stores to get the job done. But the labor rates were up a little bit more than we had anticipated coming into this year. In saying that, we are in the process right now of our rolltainer sort that you mentioned. The last time we actually did that was in 2017. And you're right, there was a small step change there in labor. I'm not suggesting that it would be as large as that by any means. But what I am suggesting is that while we feel good about the amount of labor hours we're using today, I want to continue to feel good about that. And I want our operators to continue to feel good about that. So, utilizing rolltainer store and other things that we're taking work out of the stores is not to strip more labor out of the stores, but to ensure that they have enough labor to satisfy the customer, give them the best shopping experience possible because we believe right now that is the best use of the labor hours that we have available is to further our back-to-basics work. So, stay tuned. There's always ways that we can look at the SG&A lever because it is a lot larger as you would imagine than just the labor side, while labor is a big component of it. So, stay tuned. We've got other things that we're working on that we believe can help modify a little bit of that expense as we move through the back half of the year and into next year. Operator : Our final question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Corey Tarlowe : I just wanted to ask on inventory. Inventories are down, yet in-stock levels are up, and seemingly markdown should also be increasing, so unit velocity should increase. So, I'm curious how you think about that dynamic? And then secondarily, consumable sales have continued to increase, but seasonal sales were only down slightly close to flat. I'm curious if you saw anything to call out in that category as well? Todd Vasos : So why don't I start, Kelly, and I'll turn it over to you. Yes. So let me take the second part of that question. As we exited Q2, while we weren't happy with either side of consumables or our non-consumable business, but to your point, what we saw was a flattish non-consumable business quarter-over-quarter, but a deceleration of the consumable side of the business. And what that really showed was once again that core consumer is very, very price sensitive at this point and looking for value anywhere she can find it. That's another reason why we're stepping up that promotional activity to reengage even further that consumable side of the business, which we believe, and we've already have started this venture at the end of Q2 and now into Q3, we very much believe and are seeing that engagement start to come back in. So, as we continue to ensure that we're there for the consumer, I believe that transition into a little bit more of a promotional environment will continue, but will also continue to pay off for Dollar General. And then as it relates to a little bit of the inventory, before I pass it to Kelly, is I feel very good about the inventory that we're reducing versus having to restock based on sales. As you saw, we continue to reduce, at the highest level, our consumables business, and that's usually the slowest turn business as well. And the good thing, as we continue to look forward is, these goods are fresh, they're clean, and they're very sellable and, as you can see, are selling. So, it's good to see that, but I believe it's also good that we're seeing some of the reductions to make a little bit more room inside the stores for our customers to be able to enjoy that shopping experience. Kelly Dilts : Yes. And Todd is absolutely right. So, we feel really good about the quality of our inventory. And I think, and we called it out in the prepared remarks, this team has just done a remarkable job of reducing inventory while improving in-stock that is not easy to do. So, they're really focused on optimization, and you heard us talk about some investments last year that we put in place in order to help with that. And so, we're certainly rightsizing what we're bringing into our distribution centers and then out into the stores. And we have, I would tell you that the biggest unit decrease has been in our chain, which certainly helps with efficiencies and has driven some of the progress that we've made down that football field. And now we're starting to see it in stores as well. And so that's good to see. So, I would say that this is a real bright spot in the quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference.

Todd Vasos : Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be back at Dollar General. I have a deep passion for this company and for the customers we are privileged to serve. I continue to believe in this model, our future growth prospects and our ability to deliver value and convenience for our customers, a positive experience for our employees, and long-term value for our shareholders. We take our mission of serving others seriously and know that our customer is facing financial constraints and communities are looking for strong partners in a tough macroeconomic environment. Historically, we've met those challenges head-on and delivered for our customer. And we believe that we are well positioned to do so now. In retail, one of the best ways to diagnose the state of the business is by looking at it through the eyes of the customer. And we know that our customers rely on Dollar General to provide the products they need at great values in convenient, friendly and easy-to-shop stores. We have spent the last several weeks taking a fresh look at all areas of our business as well as the challenges and opportunities in front of us. We believe that we have a good understanding of what we need to do to address those challenges and opportunities, and we're already taking action. To be clear, this is not about rebuilding a team or organization, but about refocusing efforts already underway. This is where I want to spend the majority of our time today. I won't share all the details this morning but I want to provide an overview to highlight our focus on getting back to the basics in our stores, in our supply chain and within our merchandising. After that, Kelly and I will review our third quarter performance. I want to start with our stores, where everything begins and ends for our customer. As we drive improvement across our store footprint, we are doing so through the lens of our customers. As we have previously announced, we are investing approximately $150 million in store labor hours this year. After review, we continue to believe this level of investment is appropriate. But as we do with every dollar we invest, we must ensure we are spending it to drive the greatest return, which means we are directly helping our store teams support our customers. With that in mind, we have made the decision to redeploy labor hours away from smart teams and instead more directly to our store teams and a greater emphasis on customer service and store-level inventory management activities. To that end, I want to highlight 2 areas of focus we believe will drive the greatest improvement in our stores. First, we plan to increase the employee presence at the front end of our stores and in particular, the checkout area. While self-checkout has contributed to the convenient proposition for our customers in certain stores, it does not reduce the importance of a friendly, helpful employee who is there to greet customers and assist while the checkout process is happening. We have already begun by allocating more labor to front-end activities and clearly communicating our expectations around the visible presence of an associate at the front of our stores. Second, we are reemphasizing the role played by our store teams in our perpetual inventory management process, which we believe will positively impact our on-shelf availability as well as our customers' convenience perception in our sales. To do this, we are reallocating some of our labor investments toward store level inventory management processes, including an even greater focus on getting product on to our shelves more quickly. We are also reducing the span of control for our district managers which will provide more opportunity for engagement with our store managers and their teams and more consistency and execution across the store base. As we take these actions and focus on the basics in our stores, we believe we will see improved retention at the store manager level where our turnover is currently higher than we like. And we know from experience that when we stabilize the store manager position, the entire store and team benefit, which ultimately drives a more positive experience for our customers as well as improved sales and shrink results. Overall, we believe these actions will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including customer service, on-shelf availability and convenience as well as sales, while our focus on the front end should also reduce shrink. These efforts also should help us improve employee engagement and retention. Next, I want to talk about our supply chain. We have made significant progress recovering from the distribution capacity constraints that we had discussed late last year. However, through the lens of the customer, we see additional opportunity for improvement, particularly when it comes to serving our stores. As we focus on getting back to the basics, the goal within our supply chain is for our truck deliveries to be on time and in full, or OTIF. As we continue to drive our OTIF rates higher, we simplify the work for our store teams, which again results in a better overall experience for both our customers and associates as well as an expectation of higher sales. I want to briefly highlight 3 areas of focus within our supply chain. First, we plan to better optimize the inventory within our distribution centers. As I will discuss in a moment, we are taking steps to reduce inventory, including SKU rationalization, which will allow for the more efficient movement of product for our distribution teams. Second, we are implementing productivity improvement initiatives within our distribution centers. While productivity rates have been impacted by both internal and external factors, we are working to mitigate or eliminate productivity impediments for our teams and control the things we can control. These efforts include standardizing system configurations and optimizing the product layout in our facilities, while providing clear communication on performance standards and expectations. And third, now that we're past the capacity constraints we experienced last year, we are reducing the number of temporary outside warehouse facilities being used to store product as inventory flows more effectively to and through our existing distribution centers. By better leveraging these existing distribution centers and taking advantage of the new permanent facilities we have opened over the last year and those we will open next year, we believe we can significantly reduce the amount of temporary warehouse space needed. As we've done historically, we likely will continue to maintain a few of these temporary facilities. However, we expect to transition out of many of them in Q4 and into next year. All of these actions within our supply chain should translate to lower distribution and transportation costs, better OTIF rates and better customer experience and all while improving sales results.  Finally, I want to speak to our focus on fundamentals and merchandising. Once again, we reflected on our approach to the eyes of our customer. For our merchants, there is no greater priority than offering great value of the products our customers want and need. Our customers are offering living paycheck to paycheck and continually tell us that value is the most important factor in their shopping decisions. I am pleased to note that we are in good shape when it comes to our everyday pricing. And we are right where we want to be in our price gaps with our competitors and classes of trade. With that said, we are taking a hard look at what else we can do to drive value for our customers in this challenging economic environment, including highlighting private brands and other opportunities for savings as well as maximizing the effectiveness of any promotional activity to drive traffic and share growth. Beyond these opportunities for our customers, we have also challenged our merchants to consider how they can drive simplification for our stores and supply chain as well with meaningful SKU rationalization as one of the most immediate areas of focus. To that end, we have identified several opportunities to eliminate certain SKUs that have become less productive; first, by moving them out of our DCs and then ultimately to our stores to sell through. As our store teams have fewer SKUs to manage, we can lower our cost to serve, while driving higher inventory turns and higher sales of products that are most important to our customers.  We believe these actions will help further reduce inventory and shrink, while simplifying operations in both DCs and stores to drive greater efficiencies over the longer term. We all know that driving traffic and market share are essential to long-term retail success. And while our results have been improving in these areas, we are still not satisfied with our current position. We believe we have identified actions that will pay dividends over both the short and long term, as we remain focused on driving profitable sales growth. In summary, we are getting back to the basics here at Dollar General across all levels of the organization. Our desired results will not materialize overnight, but we believe we will see some early wins and continue to make progress towards executing on the fundamentals that have been foundational to our success over the past 85 years. As a result, we believe we will significantly enhance the customer experience while driving higher sales and increased profitability in our business. Now before I turn the call over to Kelly, I want to briefly discuss some of our top line results for Q3 as well as our 2024 real estate plans, which we announced earlier this morning. Net sales in the third quarter increased 2.4% to $9.7 billion compared to net sales of $9.5 billion last year's third quarter. Within our net sales growth, we again grew market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales as well as an overall non-consumable product sales. Same-store sales decreased 1.3% in Q3, which was in line with our expectations. The decrease was driven by a decline in average transaction amount, primarily driven by units and included declines in all 4 product categories. From an overall monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was very similar in all 3 months of the quarter. However, I'm pleased to note that customer traffic was positive in Q3. After starting the quarter slightly negative, traffic turned positive in the middle period and improved sequentially each period of the quarter. Notably, Customer traffic and same-store sales continue to improve in November, which, although early in the quarter, we believe reflects early traction from our work on getting back to the basics here at Dollar General. Turning to a quick update on our customer. During our most recent survey work, our customer continues to tell us they are feeling significant pressure on their spending which is supported by what we see in their behavior. Based on these trends and what we see in the macroeconomic environment, we anticipate customer spending may continue to be constrained as we head into 2024, especially in discretionary categories. This further reinforces the importance of the work we're doing today, and we believe our unique value and convenient proposition is as relevant as ever in this marketplace. To that end, I want to discuss our plans for real estate growth next year as we look to extend our offering to many more communities. Real estate continues to be one of our core competencies and we remain pleased with the performance of our real estate projects. As a reminder, we monitor the following 5 metrics of our new store portfolio, including performance against pro forma sales expectations, new store productivity compared to the mature store base; cannibalization, which overall has remained consistent and predictable; cash payback, which we continue to expect in 2 years or less; and new store returns, which we expect to be approximately 18% on average in 2024. I want to note that our expectations for new store returns, while still very strong, are down modestly from our historical target of 20%-plus. This change is being driven partially by higher new store openings and occupancy cost, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. We also continue to see strong performance from our remodel stores, which drive comp sales lifts between 8% and 11% for our DGTP format and average returns, which continue to be greater than what we see from our new stores. With this consistently strong performance, we continue to see real estate projects as one of our best uses of capital. In fiscal 2024, we plan to execute approximately 2,385 projects, including 800 new openings, 1,500 remodels and 85 relocations. While this is a significant number of projects, I want to acknowledge a smaller number than we have opened in the recent years due primarily to a couple of considerations. First, we want to ensure that our teams across the company are focused on getting back to the basics and the efforts I discussed a few moments ago. And second, the capital required to execute these projects has increased significantly. For example, the initial opening of our 8,500 square foot store has increased more than 30% since we began rolling out the larger format in 2022. Additionally, nonresidential construction costs have increased significantly since pre-COVID. Our team has a number of efforts underway to reduce these costs, including engineering costs out of the projects. And we believe, over time, we will be able to mitigate some of the impact we have seen from inflation. With that said, our pipeline remains robust. We continue to see more than 12,000 opportunities for Dollar General bannered stores in the United States. And as we said before, for a variety of reasons, we will not capture each of these opportunities, but we are pleased that the overall number of opportunities remains high. We continue to innovate on store formats as an important element of our real estate strategy, and I want to take a moment to provide some additional color on our plans for 2024. We are placing a heavier emphasis on rural stores in 2024 with more than 80% of our new stores planned in rural communities where we believe we can have the most significant and positive impact for our customers. In addition, more than 90% of our new stores and relocations will be in one of our larger store formats, which continues to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional 7,300 square foot box. These larger stores also provide additional opportunities to serve our customers, including expanded cooler offerings to help them build meals to feed their families, more health and beauty products and fresh produce in many stores. Also included within our store plans are approximately 30 new pop shelf locations as we continue to move at a measured pace with this concept in a softer discretionary sales environment. Finally, we've been very pleased with our initial entry into Mexico and our new store plans for 2024 also include approximately 15 new Mi S\u00faper Dollar General stores in Mexico. Turning to remodels. Nearly 70% are planned to be in our DGTP format, which will provide the opportunity for significant increase in cooler count as well as the potential to add fresh produce in many of these stores. We are excited about our real estate plans for 2024 as we continue to grow the number of communities we are serving, particularly in rural America. In closing, we have tremendous growth opportunities in front of us, which we are uniquely well positioned to capture. We are working diligently on getting back to the basics, and we are laser-focused on serving our customers while providing meaningful opportunity for our employees and creating long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I now would like to turn the call over to Kelly. Kelly Dilts : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. For third quarter, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29%, a decrease of 147 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in shrink, lower inventory markups and increased markdowns. These were partially offset by decreases in LIFO and transportation costs. Turning to SG&A, which was 24.5% of sales, an increase of 183 basis points. This increase was driven by retail labor, including approximately $29 million of our targeted labor investment as well as depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance, rent, professional fees, other services purchased, including debit and credit card transaction fees. These were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter decreased 41.1% to $433.5 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 4.5%, a decrease of 330 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter increased to $82 million compared to $54 million in last year's third quarter, driven by higher average borrowings and higher interest rates. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.3% and compares to 22.8% in the third quarter of last year. This lower rate is primarily due to increased benefits from federal employment tax credits and an increased benefit from rate-impacting items caused by lower earnings before taxes for the third quarter. These benefits were partially offset by a higher state effective tax rate. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 45.9% to $1.26. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.4 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 3% compared to last year and a decrease of 1.8% on a per store basis. In addition, total nonconsumable inventory decreased approximately 15% compared to last year and decreased 19% on a per store basis. While the inventory growth rate has significantly moderated from its peak in the third quarter last year and the quality of our inventory remains good, we continue to believe there is opportunity to optimize and reduce our inventory levels. We continue to review our markdown plans related to the previously announced $95 million investment, including associated costs to ensure we are maximizing the impact of these actions. We are focused on optimizing our overall inventory position to better support our customers, stores, distribution centers and growth plans. Year-to-date, through Q3, the business generated cash flows from operations of $1.4 billion, an increase of 15.5%. Total capital expenditures through Q3 were $1.2 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $129.5 million. As planned, we did not repurchase shares this quarter. Now I want to take a moment to provide an update on our financial outlook. We continue to expect the following for fiscal year 2023. First, net sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%. Next, same-store sales in the range of a decline of approximately negative 1% to flat, and EPS in the range of $7.10 to $7.60 or a decline of negative 34% to negative 29%. Our EPS guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Finally, we expect capital spending in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, and no share repurchase activity. Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook for the rest of 2023. While we continue to see a more constrained consumer and softer sales trends than we expected coming into the year, those trends were anticipated when we provided our guidance update in October. We have always been an all-weather brand and aided by the actions that Todd outlined earlier, we are poised and ready to serve our customer in this challenging economic environment. In the near term, we expect continued overall pressure on the sales line, particularly in the nonconsumable categories. Within gross margin, in addition to sales mix pressure in our previously announced markdowns, shrink has continued to be a sizable headwind, and we expect this will remain with us into next year as any shrink improvement typically takes at least a year from a store's most recent count to show up in our financial results. Partially offsetting these challenges, we expect benefits from greater distribution center capacity and performance, lower carrier rates, our private tractor fleet and other distribution and transportation efficiencies. We also continue to expect realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and the DG Media Network. Turning to SG&A. We plan to make the remaining $50 million of our planned total labor investment of approximately $150 million in our stores during Q4. Overall, the investments we have previously discussed in retail labor markdowns and other areas to better support our customers, stores and distribution centers are expected to total up to $270 million in 2023, which is consistent with our previous expectations. We are reviewing every aspect of these investments to ensure we maximize their impact for our customers and stores while driving the greatest return moving forward. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and guide us today. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. Next, we return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment. And finally, over time, and when appropriate, share repurchases. Although our leverage ratio is currently above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in order to support our commitment to our current investment grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and BAA2. With all of that said, cash generation is very important, particularly in this environment, and we are focused on maintaining and improving strong cash flow as we head into 2024. In summary, we remain committed to maintaining our discipline and how we manage expenses and capital as a low-cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We are confident in our business model and our ongoing long-term financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Kelly. As we wrap up, let me just say again that we're laser-focused on getting back to the basics. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, some of these actions will take a little bit more time to deliver the desired results. But we expect to demonstrate significant progress over the coming months and look forward to sharing more with you in the quarters ahead. . This team is energized, and we are confident in the actions we're taking to drive operational excellence for our customers and employees and long-term value creation for our shareholders. I want to thank our approximately 185,000 employees for their commitment to doing the work necessary to serve our customers and communities every day. I am proud of this team, and look forward to serving our customers together as we move through this busy holiday season. With that, operator, we'd now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Welcome back, Todd. So I wanted to kick it off just with longer-term operating margins. Do you feel like you can sustain a 6%-plus operating margin level longer term? And do you think you can get back to 8%-plus, where you have historically operated? And then to get to that 8%-plus, where do you see potentially the bigger buckets of opportunity going forward? Todd Vasos : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take the second part of that and then pass it over to Kelly. We hear a Dollar General have gone back to the basics. You heard that in my prepared remarks, and I have to say, it has truly energized this company at all different levels. Everything starts and stops at the store with the customer. And what we've done is actually, again, nothing rocket science here, we've actually gone in and looked at every element of our business. It touches our consumer from the lens of the consumer. Again, you would think that, that is always an ongoing piece. But sometimes it's good to remind yourself and remind you organization. So we've done that. And with that, and I won't go through all of that because you saw a lot of it in my prepared remarks, but really getting back to the basics, making sure that the labor that we've already have deployed in our stores and yet to come in the fourth quarter, the $150 million of additional labor is spend in the proper way. And again, that redeployment of money from the smart teams directly into our store where it touches our customer each and every day immediately is so important, and that's exactly what we're going to do. And as we do that, and I think it's very important to point out, it also helps the front end of that store. And it helps on the sales line because we've got somebody to meet, greet and ring up the customer. It also helps on the shrink line because you've got somebody at the front end of the store that is always there to monitor the front end of the store. And also, it helps on the convenience side because we had relied and start to reply too much this year on self-checkout in our stores. We should be using self-checkout as a secondary checkout vehicle, not a primary. And so with all that, it's really going to help. And then when you focus in on our supply chain, getting the right product at the right time to our stores or OTIF in full and on time, I would tell you that, that's going to make a world of difference. Again, being an old operator that I am, there's nothing more disruptive in the store, not getting your truck on time and be able to get all the truck up onto the shelf when it comes in; and by the way, having the right items when you do put it on the shelf. And then lastly, really honing in this merchandising piece. We've got probably one of the best merchant groups in all of consumable retailing. But at times, you have to step back and look at what brought you to the party may not always be exactly what you need to do to go forward. Sometimes you got to step back to go forward. And I would tell you that's the case here on a couple of levels. One being the number of SKUs we're carrying, SKU rationalization is always an ongoing piece at Dollar General. But I believe that it's time to really step back and energize that even more in 2024. And we've already actually have gone deep here, turned off a lot of SKUs. There's going to be a lot more to come. And the idea here is turning off or eliminating SKUs that are more in the secondary or tertiary type of line. So think about [indiscernible] as an example. We may have 5 or 6 different variants of [indiscernible] on the shelf today. We can easily drop 1 or 2 of those. The consumer is not going to know the difference, actually is going to make her life a little simpler when she goes to the shelf, going to make the store's life simpler to put product on the shelf. And also, what it's going to do is help our warehouses actually eliminate a lot of holding slots. So a lot of benefit to what we're going to do in SKU rationalization. And all of this, which is fabulous, and I'll pass it over to Kelly, will actually start to move down to the bottom line, some faster than others. But again, being an old line retailer that I am, I know that these actions will fall to the bottom line and also help increase our top line as we go into '24. Kelly? Kelly Dilts : Thanks, Todd. And just so everybody knows, our goal is certainly to get back to the historic levels of operating margin and profit that we're used to. While we're not going to give guidance, obviously, for '24 today, I do want to give a little bit of color of '24 just around some near-term headwinds that we're seeing. The first of those is around lapping really significantly reduced incentive compensation as well as stock-based compensation. And so that will just be a near-term headwind as we think about 2024. The other thing that we're looking at right now is we're expecting a higher effective tax rate. And that's really due to lower benefits around the stock-based compensation piece as well as we've seen historically just some higher state effective tax rates as we have moved through the last few years. So those are near-term headwinds, certainly not anything long term that we need to worry about. The other thing is around shrink. And so as you know, shrink has been pretty significant for us for a while, and it's definitely going to carry into 2024. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, it just takes a while to start showing up in your financial results. And just to give you a little bit more color of kind of where we are with shrink on a year-to-date basis. Shrink is actually 100 basis point headwind for us. And then as we moved into Q3, it's actually running just a little bit higher than that. And so certainly a pressure near term for us, something that we're looking to hopefully -- we're mitigating along the way, and it'll show up in the financial results later in 2024. And then as we think about just our underserved customers, we're just making sure that we're watching her and whether she gains -- stays gainfully employed. All the actions that Todd just noted and getting back to the basics is certainly going to set us up nicely to be able to serve her and it doesn't matter what economic environment. And we've always been an all-weather brand, and we certainly will continue to be so as we move forward. So that's a little bit of color on '24. We're going to give you a lot more color in March and give you a little bit more holistic view there. But what I'll say is, overall, the fundamentals of this business are absolutely unchanged and this model remains strong. And on a longer-term basis, we believe that we're going to get back to the historic levels that this model is accustomed to delivering. Operator : Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Welcome back, Todd. When you rejoined, you talked about you having an opportunity to revisit the financial profile of the business. And if there was a time to look back and reset and invest deeper that you could take that opportunity. As the business looks to be forming a bottom in margin and thinking about getting to 7% or plus in a reasonable time frame, do you have any updated thoughts on that? Does it make sense to lean in so that when you start building back, it builds back sustainably, do you think the business needs a little more investment than you thought 1.5 months ago? Todd Vasos : Yes. Thank you for the question. And you're 100% right. The first few weeks back on the deck here, I did take a holistic view across not only our operations, but as you heard, our supply chain, our merchandising areas, looked at everything holistically, and I'll just click off a few. But first, let me say before I click it off, is that I believe that the investments that have been already talked about this year are $100 million and $150 million in totality labor investments were the exact right thing to do. I don't believe at this point that I see a need that we need to make any other larger outsized investments as we move into '24. I believe, as I indicated, that the right thing to do is make sure that the $150 million is being used appropriately and in the right areas that touches the consumer and helps our stores be able to better serve our consumer each and every day. And that's exactly what we've done now over the last few weeks. And that's why I believe taking the smart teams out of the equation, taking that whole bunch of labor that was dedicated to that, putting it directly in our stores to cover the front end of our stores more effectively each and every day, 100% of the time tethered to the front end for customer service and ringing up our customers. And then also one of the first for Dollar General, quite frankly, and that is deploying some of that labor into a work that ensures that we keep our perpetual inventory correct and ongoingly correct each and every day. Because once again, if the system doesn't realize you need product, it won't send you product. And unfortunately, over the last year or so, our perpetual inventory numbers have gotten further and further out of whack, quite frankly. And we are now in the midst of bringing those back. We've seen a lot of great traction, but the redeployment of hours of this $50 million coming out of the smart teams will really benefit. And again, this is a first for Dollar General, so it will be great to see that as well. And then as I looked into other areas of the company, I feel fabulous about our pricing. The great thing when I step back in, our everyday pricing across all channels of trade, including our chief competitor, looks very good and in great position. As a matter of fact, our gaps are right where we would like to see them compared to historical levels. So very good there. Our promotional activity, while I still believe I would call it semi rational across the spectrum, we have seen an uptick in recent weeks on promotional activity. We're watching that carefully. Is that because we're moving into the holidays? Or is that something that will sustain as we move into '24? So we're watching that carefully. But you know us pretty well, Simeon, we're going to take whatever action is needed. We're going to take it quickly, and we'll make sure that our pricing stays exactly where it needs to be to service our customers. But at this point, I don't see a need to reinvest any large amounts, sums of money in margin to do anything there. But again, we always reserve the right to be able to do it if that time arises. So right now, I think the investments we've already talked about over this past year are in the system. I believe they're appropriate. They're now being used, I believe, very appropriately in all areas and are deployed the proper way. Now it's time for execution. And that's what we're doing. We're already starting to see a little bit of benefit, especially as we moved into November on some of our top line results both in consumables and nonconsumables, quite frankly, as we move through November. So it's great to see it. But again, caution it's very early in the quarter, and it's very early in this new look at how Dollar General is going to go to market. But rest assured, as Kelly indicated, we feel very good about the long-term prospects of getting back to historical levels here at Dollar General. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Maybe, Todd, at higher level. Could you just help elaborate on some of the recent changes in behavior that you're seeing from the low-end consumer? The traffic versus ticket trends that you cited, I think, are interesting. But maybe asked a different way, traffic is improving, what's constraining the comp through the third quarter? Did comps actually turn positive in November tied to some of these initiatives? And then just lastly, on the new stores and the mindset shift to maybe down shift a bit, could you just elaborate on some of those pieces that you walked through, occupancy costs and some of the other moving parts? And just what you're seeing on the new store return to maybe just take a pause here? Todd Vasos : Okay, sure. As we look at our results as we move through the quarter, as we indicated, each of the periods were very similar, but we did see continued uptick in our traffic as we move through the quarter and then into November. Now I'm not going to give you a lot of color in November, but to say that we did see a change in trajectory on our comp as well as we moved into November. So it was great to see. And I would tell you that, again, it was both on the consumable and the nonconsumable side of the equation. Now one would say, \"Well, where is it in the comp?\" Well, I would tell you the comp actually was much better as we move through the end of October into November, but we still have a lot of work to do, Matt, to get back to some historical comp type rights here at Dollar General. I believe the back to basic work that we're doing is going to help us get there faster as you move into the back half of Q4 and into Q1 of '24. Making sure our stores are stocked each and every day when the consumer walks in the store. They'll be able to find what they need is going to be very, very important. So more to come. We've already started to see that. We've actually have seen our in-stock rates markedly improve over the last few weeks. We check it and watch it each and every week. And I believe that has added to some of that betterment and comp that I talked about in November. So more to come. I believe the macro still has an effect on us as well as others. But what we've always been and prided ourselves on control, which you can control here at Dollar General, and we're doing just that with back to basics. And we believe that we can help overcome some of those shortcomings in the macro environment with being able to control what -- and what the consumer feels and sees when she's in the store. So more to come. We feel like we're on the right track here, but we've got a lot of work yet to do, but I feel good about that. As far as our new stores. As you noted, we did take a little bit of a step back this year. Again, this was one of the areas that I cracked open as soon as I walked in the door. Again, we looked at -- there was no sacred cows. We looked at every single piece of this business. One of the things that I do here with the team, every line of that P&L is scrutinized, every single line, including our investments in capital. And as I looked at our new stores, while still wildly the best use of our capital across the board, I feel it was a prudent decision to take a step back. Now some people would say, \"Boy, still building 800 stores, that's not too big of a step back, that's still a large commitment,\" and it is, Matt. But it was a prudent decision for a couple of reasons. One, we talked about the increased cost to build a store today. The interest rates are up. The cost to build a store is up. I feel very good about the work the team has done. They've mitigated some of those costs, but we still have a lot of work to do yet to mitigate even further some of these costs. So why not take a little bit of a step back in new store development, give our teams the opportunity to also get a lower cost to put these buildings in. So we're doing that as we speak. And I believe that it's exactly the right thing to do. And then as you then step a little bit further back, when you look at some of the work we have to do just internally, it's probably a prudent thing to do to step back a little bit as well, so we can go forward faster in the outer years. Now I believe that this -- while this may or may not be a 1-year phenomenon, I would tell you that the way we're looking at it right now, we're not here to give guidance past '24, is that we don't see any reason why we can't up our new store openings as we continue to move forward. We love what we see on still 12,000 opportunities to put a Dollar General out in the continental United States, and we've always prided ourselves on being very quick and first to market to capture the majority and release the oversized portion of those 12,000 opportunities. So nothing yet that we see stands in the way of that. And Kelly, you may want to just touch on the returns just really quickly. Kelly Dilts : Yes. No, absolutely. And so an 18% return in this environment is fabulous, and Todd noted it, it's still a great use of capital. The new unit economics are still very strong as we move into '24. And it has a great payback period still of less than 2 years. And the other thing that we haven't seen is any change in the cannibalization rate. The other thing I'd point out and Dollar General is just fantastic at this. Our real estate group is pretty amazing, and we have an extremely high hit rate of success and you've seen that over the years. So we feel really good about the projects. We feel good about the 18% return, and of course, as Todd noted, while we're pleased with all of that in typical Dollar General fashion, we're going to work to improve it as we go through '24. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Sigman with Barclays. Seth Sigman : I wanted to talk about inventory a little bit. Just in terms of the progress rightsizing your inventory position. Can you just give us a little bit more perspective on where you sit today with consumables versus nonconsumables? And then is it your expectation to exit the year clean? Or do you feel like you're going to still need some incremental actions into next year? And then I'll just add a second part to the question around the top line. When you look at the improving trends the last few months, to what extent has that been influenced by markdowns and clearance activity? Kelly Dilts : Yes. No, thanks for the question. And inventory reduction is absolutely a priority of ours this year, and it will be a priority as we move into next year. I think the good news for us is that the quality of our inventory is good, but we've talked a lot in the past about the benefits of inventory reduction and just what that does as you reduce the complexities in both the stores and the distribution centers. So I would say our progress is on track in our reduction efforts, and you saw a little bit of that in the numbers today. So total inventory increase was 3% on a year-over-year basis. But if you look at it on a per store basis, we're down 1.8%. I think the real story here is, is around the nonconsumable piece. And so we are down 15% on a year-over-year basis there, and we're down 19% on a per store basis. I think the other important thing to call out, and we've been calling it out every quarter, but this one is even more significant as we've seen a 58% decrease in our import receipts. And again, that's us buying around that product and making sure that we're selling through it. And so we feel good about where we're headed for the end of the year. Just a little bit longer term, I'd say we have several work streams in place that are working on inventory reduction, but just as important, and this kind of goes to the top line is inventory optimization and making sure that we're going where the customer wants us to go. And so I would say with all of these things in place, we should feel pretty good about where we're landing at the end of '23, but we're going to feel even better as we see continued improvement in inventory levels as we move through '24. Todd Vasos : Thanks, Kelly. And as you look at our results in Q3 and how that relates to any activity around clearing this inventory, I would tell you that I feel very good about the balance here. While there was some activity there, actually, some of the bigger activities is really slated for Q4, if needed. And a lot of that will be centered around our sell-through of holiday. So we're watching that very closely. But again, early results would say it's right in line where we thought it would be right now. And actually, in some areas, a little bit better. So we're watching that carefully. But I would also say, as we continue to move forward, what we like and what I've seen since I've been back, is I believe we've done exactly the right thing on moving through some of this inventory. But as I look at the quality of our inventory, it is in very good shape. And actually, as Kelly just indicated, a lot of what we have right now to deal with on an overstock basis is actually more in our core everyday goods. So this isn't about a bunch of screw drivers and hammers or fashion-type items for holiday that we have to move through, this is about having a little bit too much of some basic paper cleaning, food-type items, things like that, that will move through the system pretty naturally as long as we do the right thing with our supply chain and our stores, and that's exactly what back to the basics is meant to address. So feel very good about that and very good about what we see going into the back half of this year and '24. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Welcome back, Todd. Given everything that outlined this morning, when is it realistic for us as outsiders to hold the team accountable to getting back to consistently producing a double-digit EPS growth algorithm like Dollar General has done in the past? And as part of that, Kelly pointed to a few factors that are going to weigh on Dollar General's profitability in 2024. Could you give more texture and timing around how large those factors are like incentive compensation and shrink? Todd Vasos : Yes, thank you, Michael. As both Kelly and I have both said, I don't see anything that gets in the way longer term to getting back to some of our historical ways that we return to our shareholders and our customers. We feel that we're on the right track with our back to basics moves here, both in our labor investments, in our inventory investments as well as in our supply chain and merchandising. So we feel like we've taken the right appropriate actions now, and we're moving with speed and intent. As I said in my prepared remarks, some of it will occur and manifest itself faster and some will take a little bit more time. But rest assured, we are hitting every single item, and we're monitoring every single item every week here to make sure it's on the right track. And if it happens not to move the way we want, we will then make an adjustment to ensure that it does. We are squarely focused on getting this company back to its historical returns that everyone is accustomed to seeing. And most importantly, our customer is used to seeing at store level. Now as Kelly indicated, there are some near-term headwinds. As much as I would love Michael to give you more color right now, we're not here to give '24 guidance. We wanted to though make sure that you can contextualize at least some of those headwinds as we start to move into 2024, but rest assured, we're going to give you more than you need in the components when we come back and give you the guidance for 2024 to make sure that you can build the models out the proper way. But again, I want to make sure you also understand, though, that we're not going to wait till '24. We're taking action now to continue to modify and also continue to ensure that we're addressing any of the gaps that are out there that are well in our control. There'll just be a few things that may not be fully in our control in '24 that will probably be more of a onetime in nature that we'll address at the right time. Operator : Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Katharine McShane : We were wondering how you would frame the risk of deflation across your box into next year? And how do you think about the puts and takes across the P&L as a result? Todd Vasos : Yes. That's a good question. And there's been a lot written up in certain areas on deflation. We've seen some deflationary pieces starting to show up, especially in our nonconsumable discretionary type areas. Nothing that alarms us at this point as we move into 2024. How we're looking at it is we see some real opportunity to reduce initial costs, especially in our import-related goods, not only from the factory, but also for the transportation side. So ocean freight, fuel cost, bunker fuel cost and such have moderated greatly over the last year. So there's some opportunity to pull cost out. Some of that, we will definitely pass on to the consumer as we continue to watch, especially in those commodity areas of the import side of the business because there's always some good -- even in our nonconsumable areas, there are some good commodity-type items in there. From a consumable perspective, while there's always movement in those areas of commodities : milk, dairy type areas, oils, wheat, we watch that very carefully. We have component pricing here at Dollar General for not only our national brands, but our private brands. We watch that very, very closely and we monitor that. Now in saying that, we haven't seen in center of store, if you will, dry grocery, chemical paper, very, very little deflationary pressures. A little bit on those commodities in dairy, as I indicated, some meat items, which we don't -- are not a huge player in. Produce, we're a little bit of a player there in what we've done.  There's some deflation there. But again, I would tell you, in totality, nothing that alarms us or believes that it will adversely affect the top line as we move into '24, at least nothing at this point shows that. Operator : Our final question is from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : Welcome back, Todd as well. Can you talk a little bit about the out-of-stock issue and perhaps quantify the drag that it's been to comps over the past few quarters? I believe it's probably pretty sizable and the measures you're taking to improve that issue? And then on the SKU rationalization, that's interesting. I was just wondering if you could speak to maybe the number of SKUs you have in an average store today? So say, relative to back in 2019 and how big of an opportunity that can be? And how long do you think you'll take to get back to an optimal level? Todd Vasos : Yes, sure. I would tell you that the amount of out of stocks we have in our store are probably some of the largest that I've seen in the 15-plus years I've been here and saying that. There are so many work streams that are now underway, Chuck, that I feel good about where we're headed. As I just indicated a few moments ago, we saw a meaningful change over the last 2 weeks in our in-stock rates at store level. And these are not just on our perpetual inventory system, but this has actually counted inventory from our inventory -- our Washington inventory group that takes our yearly fiscal inventory. So these are real counts, if you will, real out of stocks and not just out of stocks on the shelf, but out of stocks in the back room, too, so meaning it is not in the system for the consumer at all. So we saw a meaningful drop in that, meaning more available to the consumer. We believe as we move through the rest of this quarter and into the first, we're going to make even further meaningful advances. Why? We're putting hours toward the inventory specialist role that I mentioned earlier. This is a first for Dollar General to go in and ensure that we keep our on hand or our perpetual inventories more accurate than we have in the past. We've done this activity in the past, but we have come up with and we are teaching and training individuals to do this in a little bit of a different way, taking a fresh look at it, a fresh approach at it, doing more areas of the store on a weekly basis at a time to ensure that we touch every SKU. And by the way, touching every department of the store at least once a month and the higher velocity areas more than once a month. So we feel good about the direction. We feel good about how we will be able to quickly pivot and make some adjustments here.  Now on the SKU rationalization side. I would tell you that -- and we've said this in the past, we've got between 11,000 and 12,000 total SKUs in our store today, depending on the format, right? We've got some larger formats, as you know, than our smaller ones. But we believe we have an opportunity to take out a meaningful number of SKUs. I'm not going to give you the number right now. We're still in the midst of looking at that. And how we're looking at it again is from that secondary and tertiary type areas that I talked about it earlier. We're also, though, taking a fresh approach to look to it from a standpoint of return, right? And so not only a GMROI look at it, but also looking at it from the standpoint of shrink and other areas of components that go into a SKU. And is it still profitable? With shrink being elevated, so a lot of it in our control, some not in our control. There may be SKUs -- and by the way, there are SKUs that we'll be dropping due to the amount of shrink that is in our store as well. So it's going to be a fresh look across the portfolio SKUs we carry with the consumer in mind first, but also profitability in mind throughout the entire supply chain through our stores. So more to come. I think we can give you a little bit more color as we go into Q1 of next year on both our progress as well as maybe contextualize how meaningful we're talking about here. But rest assured, I wouldn't talk about it on this if I didn't believe it was going to be a meaningful number of SKUs and a meaningful impact to the simplification efforts within our stores. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Todd Vasos for closing comments. Todd Vasos : Thank you, and thanks for all the questions and your kind words for welcoming me back. As I said last year that serving this team at Dollar General has been the highlight of my professional career, and I feel the same sense of honor today. As you heard this morning, we have some hard work yet ahead of us but we know what to do. We've done it before, and we are absolutely set on doing it again as quickly as possible. I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us and all that we've accomplished together over the years and will continue to do so for our customers, associates and shareholders. Thank you for listening, and I hope you have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our associates for their commitment to serving our customers and their communities this year. I'm proud of the team's resilience and sense of purpose in fulfilling our mission of serving others. I was reminded again recently of the tremendous opportunity we have to serve as America's neighborhood general store as we celebrated the grand opening of our 20,000th store in Ellis, Texas. Our entire team takes great pride in serving the communities we call home with value and convenience every day.  On today's call, I will begin by recapping some of the highlights of our Q4 performance as well as briefly sharing some of our plans for 2024. After that, Kelly will share our Q4 financial update and our financial guidance for 2024. And then I'll wrap up the call with an update on our work in getting back to the basics in our execution across the business.  Turning to our fourth quarter performance. Net sales decreased 3.4% to $9.9 billion in Q4 compared to net sales of $10.2 billion in last year's fourth quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by lapping sales of $678 million from the 53rd week in fiscal 2022. Our net sales performance was highlighted by accelerating market share growth in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales as well as market share growth in dollars in nonconsumable product sales. Same-store sales grew 0.7% in Q4 and increased sequentially each period of the quarter, which we believe is a testament to the positive early impact of some of our Back to Basics work. The increase was driven by growth of nearly 4% in customer traffic, which was positive in all 3 periods of the quarter, and partially offset by a decline in average transaction amount, primarily driven by fewer items per basket.  Additionally, the comp sales increase was driven entirely by our consumable category and was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. Customers are continuing to feel the impact of the last 2 years of inflation, which we believe is driving them to make trade-offs in the store. We see this manifested in the continued pressure on sales in discretionary categories as well as accelerated share growth and penetration in private brand sales. Our commitment to providing customers with value and convenience is as important as ever. We continue to feel very good about our pricing position relative to our competitors and other classes of trade and are well positioned to help our customers stretch their dollar. As we look to further enhance the shopping experience for our customers in 2024, I want to provide a quick update on some of our plans.  We executed more than 3,000 real estate projects in 2023, including 987 new stores, 129 relocations and 2,007 remodels. We expect to build on this momentum in 2024 as we plan to execute approximately 2,385 projects, including 800 new store openings, 1,500 remodels and 85 relocations. These store opening plans include 30 pOpshelf stores and up to 15 stores in Mexico, where we recently celebrated the 1-year anniversary of our first store opening. We recently began shipping from pOpshelf-only distribution facility in Georgia, which will allow us to drive greater efficiencies in our existing traditional distribution network and better serve our pOpshelf stores.  As a reminder, pOpshelf is comprised of primarily nonconsumable product categories and, as such, is more heavily impacted by a softer discretionary sales environment. As a result, we believe we are moving at an appropriate pace of openings for this year.  We continue to believe that the pOpshelf concept provides an additional growth opportunity, but are cognizant of the near-term pressures impacting nonconsumable sales. We continue to diligently apply our learnings and refine our strategy and scaling of the business to drive higher returns.  Finally, we have always prioritized going where the customer wants us to go. And we continue to hear from many of them regarding more fresh food options. Thanks to years of great work by our teams to add cooler doors to our stores while enabling the self-distribution of these products, we now have nearly 30 doors per store on average, with ongoing opportunities to add cooler doors and frozen and refrigerated items through our fresh initiative. In addition, we have fresh produce in more than 5,400 stores at the end of the year and are targeting up to 1,500 additional stores for produce in 2024. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we made in Q4, which I will discuss in more details later. And we are excited about our plans for 2024. As we embark on our 85th year in business and with store locations within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population, we are uniquely positioned as a growth company that is privileged to be here for what matters for millions of customers across the country. We take this responsibility seriously and are committed to serving our customers and communities while developing and supporting our associates and creating long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly. Kelly Dilts : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.  As Todd already discussed sales, I'll start with gross profit. For Q4, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29.5%, a decrease of 138 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increases in shrink and markdowns, lower inventory markups and a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category. These were partially offset by decreases in LIFO and transportation costs. Notably, year-over-year shrink headwinds continued to build during the year, increasing more than 100 basis points for both the fourth quarter and full year. We are taking multiple actions aimed at reducing shrink in 2024, which Todd will discuss in more detail later in the call. Turning to SG&A. It was 23.6% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 189 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by retail labor, including the remaining $50 million of our targeted labor investment as well as store occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance and other services purchased, including debit and credit card transaction fees. These increased expenses were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation.  Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased 37.9% to $580 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 5.9%, a decrease of 327 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter increased to $77 million compared to $75 million in last year's fourth quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20% and compares to 23.2% in the fourth quarter last year. This lower rate is primarily due to the effect of certain rate-impacting items such as federal tax credits on lower earnings before taxes as well as lower state effective rate resulting from increased recognition of state tax credits. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 38% to $1.83, which was at the higher end of our internal expectations. For the full year, EPS decreased 29% to $7.55, including an estimated negative impact of approximately 4 percentage points from lapping the 53rd week and a negative impact of approximately 4 percentage points from higher interest expense.  Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 3.5% compared to fiscal year 2022 and a decrease of 1.1% on a per store basis. Notably, total nonconsumable inventory decreased approximately 17% compared to last year and decreased 21% on a per store basis. I want to acknowledge the great work the team has done to reduce our inventory position this year. We've made significant progress optimizing our inventory mix and levels, and we continue to believe that the quality of our inventory remains good. As Todd will discuss in a few moments, we will continue to focus on inventory levels in 2024, including additional opportunities to reduce per store inventory.  In 2023, the business generated cash flows from operations of $2.4 billion, an increase of 21% as we improved our working capital primarily through inventory management. Total capital expenditures were $1.7 billion, in line with our expectations and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payment of $130 million. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making, including gains in customer traffic and market share, lower inventory levels and improving cash flow from operations.  Moving to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. While we continue to make progress in our Back to Basics work, the full benefits from these actions will not be realized in a single quarter, and we anticipate they will build as we move throughout the year. With that in mind, we expect the following for 2024 : net sales growth in the range of approximately 6% to 6.7%, same-store sales growth in the range of 2% to 2.7% and an EPS in the range of $6.80 to $7.55. We currently anticipate an estimated negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.50 due to higher incentive compensation expense. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%.  We expect a reduced level of capital spending as a percent of sales compared to prior year in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which we believe is appropriate to support our ongoing growth.  Before I move on, I want to reiterate our capital allocation priorities, which we believe continue to serve us well and guide us today. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high-return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. Next, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases.  With regard to shareholder returns this year, our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share.  Finally, to support reducing our debt leverage ratio and maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings, we do not plan to repurchase common stock this year under our Board-authorized repurchase program. Although as I mentioned, share repurchases remain a part of our future capital allocation strategy.  Although our leverage ratio is currently above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings which, as a reminder, are BBB and Baa2. Cash generation is always important, and we are focused on further improving cash flow as we move through 2024. We believe these actions, which are aligned with our capital allocation priorities, will continue to strengthen our overall financial position for 2024 and beyond.  Now let me provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook for 2024. As Todd noted, inflation continues to impact our customer as they make trade-offs in the aisle and we anticipate the related sales mix headwind to gross margin will continue in 2024. In addition, after multiple years of fewer markdowns, we expect the overall promotional environment in 2024 to revert to pre-pandemic levels. We anticipate this will result in higher promotional markdowns, which will offset the lower clearance markdowns compared to last year and we'll keep overall markdowns as a percent of sales in 2024 at a similar level to 2023. In addition, we expect shrink to be an ongoing headwind to gross margin in the first part of the year before the anticipated positive impact of our mitigation efforts begin to manifest in the back half of the year.  Turning to SG&A. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate a significant headwind this year from the normalization of incentive compensation as well as ongoing headwind from depreciation and amortization. Looking at the quarterly SG&A cadence, while we expect to deleverage each quarter, we also expect sequential quarterly improvement in the year-over-year basis point comparison as we move through the year. In addition, we expect pressure in Q1 as we annualize some of the headwinds from 2023, including shrink and our investment in retail labor as well as pressure from markdowns, which we expect will have a different cadence than 2023, which was back half heavy.  While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance, given the specific Q1 headwinds, we are providing more specific detail on our expectations for the first quarter. To that end, we expect a comp sales increase of 1.5% to 2% in the first quarter, with EPS in the range of approximately $1.50 to $1.60.  In summary, we are confident in the long-term strategy for this company and believe we are well positioned to drive top and bottom line growth in the years ahead. In the near term, we are taking actions to strengthen our position to support long-term growth with our Back to Basics efforts with a particular focus on driving comp sales, gaining market share and reducing shrink. Over the long term, our underlying opportunities to grow operating margin are still in place, including shrink reduction, the DG Media Network, private brands, global sourcing, category management and inventory optimization, distribution and transportation efficiencies and our Save to Serve approach to controlling costs. We remain committed to maintaining our discipline in how we manage expenses and capital as a low-cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term.  We are pleased with our progress, and we are excited about our plans for 2024 as we continue to reinforce our foundation for future growth, while driving profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd. Todd Vasos : Thank you, Kelly. We remain committed to our 4 operating priorities of driving profitable sales growth, capturing growth opportunities, leveraging and reinforcing our position as a low-cost operator and investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion.  To advance these priorities in the near term and following the period of evaluation of the challenges and opportunities in front of us, we have implemented a refresh approach to getting back to the basics to improve store standards and the associate and customer experience in our stores. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on these efforts in our stores, supply chain and merchandising.  To better inform these efforts, the leadership team has spent a significant amount of time over the last couple of months directly engaging with our associates throughout the organization, including listening sessions in stores, distribution centers and our store support center. We also hosted more than 400 field leaders in Nashville in February, and then several of us spent time on the road with more than 1,000 additional leaders across the country. These sessions allowed us to follow up on the feedback we've received, share our action plans and commitments and align our expectations with our teams across the organization. We continue to prioritize this direct engagement with our associates and value the actionable feedback we gain to continue enhancing the way we support our teams and serve our customers, all while strengthening the sense of pride and purpose we all share at Dollar General.  I want to start with our stores, where everything begins and ends with our customer. We completed the investment of $150 million in store labor during the fourth quarter, with the additional hours primarily focused on the 2 areas we discussed on our last quarterly call. First, we significantly increased the employee presence at the front end of our stores. These team members are dedicated to providing a friendly, welcome and positive checkout experience for our customers.  Second, we take dedicated more labor to perpetual inventory management in our stores by adding specific inventory management shifts and specialized inventory training in each store. This effort has been well received by our managers and their teams and has contributed to in-stock level improvements in our stores.  As we entered 2024, we have also reduced the span of control for our district managers, adding more than 140 new districts and district managers. This significant investment in our field teams reduces the number of stores assigned to each district manager by approximately 15% and is designed to increase both the opportunity for engagement with our store managers and their teams as well as to drive consistency and execution across our store base. Finally, we've taken a fresh look at store-level tasks and activities and have taken significant action to make it easier to operate our stores. While we have made progress, we continue to focus on how we can enhance the overall customer and associate experience in our stores.  With that in mind, we are making 3 changes to our self-checkout strategy this year. As a reminder, we currently have self-checkout options available in more than 14,000 stores. Although adoption rates for self-checkout have been high, we believe there is truly no substitute for an employee presence at the front end of the store to greet customers and provide excellent customer service, including at checkout. Importantly, when choosing our self-checkout solution, we implemented a product that is convertible from self-checkout to associate-assisted checkout. To that end, we have begun immediately converting some or all self-checkout registers to assisted-checkout options in approximately 9,000 stores. This is intended to drive traffic first to our staffed registers, with assisted-checkout options available as second or third options to reduce lines during high-volume times.  Our second course of action will apply to all remaining stores with self-checkout, where we have begun limiting self-checkout to transactions consisting of 5 items or less.  And finally, over the first half of the year, we plan to completely remove self-checkout from more than 300 of our highest shrink stores. Collectively, we believe these steps are in line with where the customer wants us to be, which includes increasing personal engagement with them at the store. Additionally, we believe these actions have the potential to have a material and positive impact on shrink as we move into the back half of the year and into 2025. The 2024 portion of this benefit as well as additional labor in these stores to devote to the checkout process is included in our guidance that Kelly provided earlier.  Beyond our changes to self-checkout, we are also executing on a variety of other actions to reduce shrink this year, including inventory reduction efforts, where we see additional opportunity in 2024; SKU rationalization, which I'll discuss more momentarily; additional shrink incentive programs for our store managers to encourage and foster a greater sense of ownership; and the utilization of high-shrink planograms, whereby we will remove certain high-shrink items from high-shrink stores to target the greatest opportunity for improvement. While we anticipate a continuing headwind from shrink early this year, we believe our actions will have a significant mitigation impact in the back half of the year and into 2025. Overall, we believe these actions in our stores will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including customer service and on-shelf availability and convenience; enhance the associate experience in our stores, including improved employee engagement and retention; and drive improvements in financial results, including sales and shrink.  Next, let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. As a reminder, our top priority this year is to improve our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF. Our distribution and transportation teams are laser-focused on serving stores as their most direct customers and are pursuing several opportunities to drive higher OTIF levels. Since Q3, we have seen significant improvements in our on-time deliveries as well as customer service levels. In 2024, we will continue to pursue improvements by undertaking our first full-scale refresh of our sorting process and distribution centers since the launch of our Fast Track sortation initiative in 2017.  With the growth and evolution we have seen since that time, we are further updating the sorting process to improve our distribution flow while enabling our store teams to unload the truck and restock shelves more quickly, ultimately driving greater on-shelf availability for our customers and increased sales.  In addition to improving OTIF rates, we have also been successful in reducing inventory and optimizing the flow within our supply chain. As we said we would last quarter, we have reduced the number of temporary warehouse facilities, exiting 5 buildings in 2023, with plans to exit 7 more in 2024. We will continue to maintain a few of these temporary facilities that are more complementary to some of our smaller permanent distribution centers, but by reducing the number of outside warehouses, we can lower costs and continue to improve inventory flow throughout our supply chain. As I mentioned earlier, we opened a pOpshelf-only distribution facility earlier this year to improve efficiencies, and we expect to open Dollar General distribution centers in Arkansas and Colorado later this year as we continue to support our ongoing growth. As a result of our reduced inventory levels and optimization of existing distribution centers, we now expect to open the planned facility in Oregon at a date beyond 2024.  We are pleased with the progress we've made in our supply chain and are confident in our ability to continue progressing toward our goals. Ultimately, these actions should enhance our ability to meet challenging demands and respond to the challenges within the supply chain as well as drive greater efficiencies and further improve experience for our store teams and customers.  Finally, I want to provide an update on getting back to the basics in merchandising. Our team continues to prioritize delivering value to our customers while simplifying the work for our store teams and driving profitable sales growth. I want to echo Kelly in acknowledging the great work the team has done on inventory optimization and reduction. This has lowered our carrying costs, driven efficiencies across the supply chain and store base and positions us to better serve our customers. Importantly, we have been able to lower average inventory per store while improving our in-stock rates and driving higher comp sales growth. We expect to continue driving improvement in 2024 with several efforts already underway. We have begun actively reducing the number of SKUs we carry in our stores through our planogram reset process, and we expect net reduction of up to 1,000 SKUs in our stores by the end of 2024. Notably, we have already turned off the majority of these SKUs, which will allow us to sell through the remaining inventory while seeking to minimize the amount of related clearance markdowns, which are contemplated in our 2024 guidance.  Finally, our merchant teams have focused on reducing activity for store teams by reducing the number of floor stands and monthly endcap resets and increasing the number of products that go straight to the shelf, all which saves time in our stores and enhances the customer experience.  As we wrap up this morning, I want to reiterate that we are laser-focused on getting back to the basics of Dollar General and fulfilling our mission of serving others. I'm proud of the team's efforts over the last few months to identify gaps and opportunities, implement plans of action and deliver on our commitments that we make. We are moving with a sense of urgency and have made a lot of progress in a short amount of time. And while we are already seeing positive results from some of our actions, other efforts may take longer to deliver the intended benefit.  With all that in mind, we are excited about the future of this business. We are working hard to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us to drive meaningful operational improvement in the near term and to deliver sustainable growth and value over the long term.  I want to thank our approximately 185,000 employees for their engagement and for their dedication to serving others every day. This team is energized and committed to our Back to Basics plan, and I'm excited about all that we can accomplish together in the year ahead.  With that, operator, I'd now like to open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on the improvement. So Todd, I think it would be helpful if you could maybe speak to the top line and traffic self-help improvement that you're seeing, just given the volatile macro backdrop. So as you break down your 2024 comp guide, could you elaborate on the Back to Basics strategy? What's working today that supports the first quarter comp guidance relative to maybe incremental opportunity that you see potentially building throughout the year, particularly in the back half? Todd Vasos : Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. We're pretty pleased with what we've seen in our short run here on getting back to the basics. You can see it in our comps in Q4, you can see it in our traffic numbers and we can see it in our customer data as well. So all good signs that we're on track to where we want to get to, to get back to the basics here at Dollar General. In saying that, you saw the comp guide for Q1 at 1.5% to 2%. Obviously, that is a more robust comp than we've seen here for a better part of the year. And I think that really goes to the -- to a couple of things. One is our commitment and -- as well as our confidence in the Back to Basics work that's being done. Let me just quickly recap a couple of those so that you all can have confidence as I do and the team does here on why we believe. One is, we have done a lot of work in ensuring we've got the right amount of labor inside of our stores, $150 million in labor investments in 2023. I think most notably here as well is in Q4, the reallocation of that labor to areas that mean the most to our stores and to our customers. And so ensuring that we've got somebody at the front register to ring out 100% of the time, check, we're actually doing that, I believe, at a very high level now.  Second of all, ensuring that we put labor in to keep our on-hand and perpetual inventory counts more accurate. We, through Q4, have implemented that program, including extensive training to make sure that we feel confident long term that it will be sticky in our stores. And so I would tell you that our stores and our store employees have applauded that labor investment. And we're already starting to see some of the early benefits from that on the shelf, meaning more product on time and in the shelf. So really great to see.  Also, another big reason on the self-help side, as you indicated, that we feel confident in is that we worked hard in Q4. We've gone back and peeled the onion completely back on transportation and DC accuracy, so in our whole supply chain and then put it back together, believe it or not, in Q4. What we've seen by doing that is that we've seen our on-time rates tick up greatly. Matter of fact, in the last 4 to 5 weeks, we've seen a very, very consistent level just shy of our goals. And last week, for the first time, we hit our goals on both our fresh distribution as well as our traditional DC distribution. So great to see.  And how that manifests itself at our store is any time we can be on time and more inflow in our stores, it gives our store the ability to be able to work what we call that 7-day workflow, which -- when they're able to do that, things run very, very smoothly inside of our stores. So more to come. While we're not 100% there, we are getting there on our transportation and our distribution pieces.  And then the other pieces that really come into play here is in our merchandising areas. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we've already turned off 1,000 SKUs. We've got those turned off and already starting to burn down at store level. So we hope that we see our markdowns be somewhat limited there while we've got some markdowns, obviously, planned in 2024 to move through that product. This is really going to help the stores, 1,000 less SKUs that they have to deal with. And then at the same time, reducing the amount of floor stands coming up and other products that don't go right to the shelf. And by the way, it's going to be a substantial decrease. We -- the stores haven't seen that yet. That's coming in later in Q1 and into Q2. And by the way, it's over a 50% to 60% decrease over last year in those floor stands and those alternate items coming in. So again, a lot less work at the store.  And then lastly, as it relates to, and I alluded to it in my prepared remarks, the rolltainer sort. We haven't done that since 2017. If you remember, back in 2017, when we did do that, it makes the putting of the product onto the shelf from the delivery 15% to 20% more -- does it faster. So we're able to execute it faster at store level. And what that does and how that manifests itself at store is, bottom line, is it gets product to the shelf faster. That increases sales, and it increases the productivity of our stockers inside that store.  So more to come there. That's why we feel so bullish about what we've got coming and what we've already done. So we've done this before, Matt. We know how to do it, and we're getting at it, as you could tell with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of conviction here. Operator : Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Todd, I wanted to ask you something that kind of puts together some of the comments you made as well as what Kelly said. I wanted to ask what's gone well since you joined, what's sort of taking longer. You mentioned some things need a little more attention. And as the construct of getting back to 7-plus margins, I think we talked about it theoretically by '25. Is that something that's still achievable? And listening to the finer points and some of what Kelly spoke about, like promotions being a little bit higher, it seems like shrink is about where you thought it would be. I don't know if you were trying to signal that it's a little worse that you're taking more action, but those type of puts and takes sort of what's gone well, what's not, and then something around the 7% in the future. Todd Vasos : Yes, Simeon, thank you for the question. I'll start and then pass it over to Kelly for that second piece.  So what -- I've just covered a few of those what went well. But again, we feel good about those sales-driving activities and customer satisfaction activities that we've taken in our Back to Basics work. I believe that if you look at outside of shrink, and I'll get to that in a moment, here's how I would characterize where we are in getting back to the basics. I think this is a fundamental way to think about it.  When we started this journey in middle October of last year, I'd say, unfortunately, we were about our own 10-yard line if you think about a football analogy. I'd say that as we exited Q4 and now entering Q1, we're just crossing the 35-yard line, our own 35-yard line. I feel that we are on the right track to cross over the 50-yard line as we move through Q1 and into Q2 and start to really look at how we drive further into '24 and into '25 and get into our own red zone, if you will.  So that's how I'm looking at this. So some things are manifesting themselves and happening in real time very quickly at the store and through our customers' lens. Some will take a little longer. Now one of those things is shrink that's going to take a little longer. As you know, we take physical inventories once a year in our stores. So anything we started to do as of October of last year will take a year to manifest itself within the financials and, by the way, a little longer in some instances as things take hold, some quicker on the shrink side, some take a little longer. The great thing on the shrink side is that we know how to control this. We've done this before. Matter of fact, the individual that is in charge of operations now -- store operations, Steve Decker, Steve ran our shrink program for years here at Dollar General years ago and got it down to some of the lowest levels that -- historical lowest levels that we've seen in Dollar General pre-pandemic.  We are squarely focused as we move through '25 and into '26 to get back to those pre-pandemic levels of shrink here at Dollar General. It's just going to take us a little time. But I'd tell you, when you look at what were -- the actions we're taking and, I would say, decisive actions, especially around self-checkout, taking self-checkout, if you will, the ability of self-checkout out of 9,000 of our stores immediately and turning them to assisted-check stands is really going to benefit us.  We spent a little bit of money in Q4, and we looked at an AI solution. We brought a team in. The team was called Everseen, and it's an AI solution that monitors thousands -- hundreds of thousands of our self-checkout transactions. And we were able to see through AI what has transpired over the course of many months of transaction data at self-checkout. And what we're able to see was how much shrink -- true shrink we've had, both purpose shrink, unfortunately, and inadvertent shrink by items not being scanned properly or thinking they scanned it and didn't. Long story here to say, we've made decisions based on that AI activity to pull out in 9,000 stores and go to that assisted-check stand. That should immediately do a lot for us. Putting somebody at the front end of the store, we did in October immediate -- will help our shrink.  And then lastly, inventory control is going to help our shrink tremendously. I'm an own operator, going way back into the '80s as a System Manager, Store Manager, District Manager, VP of Operations. And I would tell you that any time you have too much inventory in the store, you've got too much shrink and damages. And damages, by the way, is just known shrink. And so more to come. I believe we're getting our arms around everything and feel very confident about where we're going. And Kelly? Kelly Dilts : Yes. No, I think Todd told you all the reasons that we really believe that we're strengthening our foundation for long-term growth. And we really believe that this business is going to return to 10% to 10% plus EPS growth on an adjusted basis over the long term.  As we move past some of the significant headwinds that Todd just talked about and getting back to all the mitigating actions that we're doing to combat those headwinds, we still have a lot of really good fundamentals in this business even with where we are and they're only going to get better. We're seeing momentum and growing share. We're growing traffic. We're starting to see healthy comps again, all the while, we've been generating a lot of cash flow. So this model is absolutely intact.  And when we think about it, we've still got a long runway for growth. We think 700 and 900 stores are certainly still in our future. We've got a lot of remodel progress that we have on our plates as well. And that, as you know, contributes 150 to 200 basis points of comp contribution, so still really solid there. And we've got a lot of long-term drivers, some new, which Todd just talked about, making sure that we're reducing shrink. The inventory optimization gives us a lot of efficiencies, both in the store and in the distribution centers.  But then we have those long-term drivers that we've had in place for a while and continue to benefit of, the DG Media Network, private brands, the global sourcing, category management, all of those things that we've had for a while are certainly still in place. And with that, we expect to continue to generate cash and are looking forward to being able to return that cash back to shareholders, not only through the dividend, which we're doing now, but also through share repurchases over the long term.  So lots of reasons to believe back in that 10% to 10% EPS growth, and we feel good about the future. Operator : Our next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. John Heinbockel : Todd, I wonder if you can address the mini-market format, your thoughts on potential -- how many stores you think you could have if we're talking several thousands. And then remind us of the economics of that. I know it's relatively new. But when you think about whether it's sales per store, sales per foot, 4-wall margins, how that might look versus other formats that you use? Todd Vasos : Sure. Thanks for the question, John. And you and I have been talking about fresh and about these type of stores for quite a while. And I would tell you, when we put into place here years ago, our ability to grow cooler count, to grow fresh produce, the way we have over the years very methodically to be profitable at it as well as then enabling all of that and soon to be produced in the near future into self-distribution, I would tell you that we feel very good about that. Then as you think about municipalities across this country that are in food deserts and/or looking for help in more fresh options, that mini market, as you indicated, our DG Market is really a lifesaver for those areas and a true lifeline for those areas where the grocery have left years ago, and we're there and can be there to help them.  So we believe in that concept greatly. And as you look at the economics, and I'll pass it over to Kelly to add a little bit more color to it. But I would tell you that we like the sales economics there. We do like the 4-wall profitability that's thrown off by that. As we continue to look at balancing it, I would tell you there are thousands of opportunities for that box across the U.S.  Kelly? Kelly Dilts : That's right now and I think Todd hit on most of it. We really like the IRR. They're certainly at the upper end of what we expect from new stores and a payback of less than 2 years. We like the top line and the flow-through on the operating margin, and the 4-wall is strong. So we think it hits all cylinders. It's great for the business, but as Todd alluded to, it's also great for our customer. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I have 2 related questions to gross margins. So Kelly, you commented on your expectation for the promotional backdrop to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Just curious if you're seeing any changes in the promotional backdrop today or whether that's just an expectation for the balance of the year. And then just on gross margins, we heard a lot about the headwinds. But just wanted any granularity in terms of whether you expect gross margins to be up or down as we think about '24. Todd Vasos : Rupesh, let me start, and I'll pass it over to Kelly. Yes, as we look out into 2024, we do believe that the promotional environment will have an uptick here. We believe that it will revert closer to where pre-pandemic levels were. In 2023, we saw an increase as well. So this isn't an immediate left- or right-hand turn here. This is what we had anticipated, quite frankly, over the last couple of years that as we enter '24, we would probably start to see this. And by the way, I think our CPG partners, and I'm sure you've seen, have signaled this for quite a while now in that they need to move units and through that, encourage, if you will, some of that promotional activity to occur. The great thing about Dollar General, we talked about the levels of markdown, but the great thing about Dollar General is that with our size and scale, we're able to get a tremendous amount of CPG help when it relates to this higher level of activity. And so our margins usually tend to be okay, if you will, as we move through these higher markdowns -- promotional markdowns. But what it also does right now, Rupesh, I believe, is it just gives that customer that's looking for more and more value right now. And by the way, this customer is getting healthier and healthier every day. We're seeing it. She's figuring out her expenses. I think you probably remember, I talked about this quite often. It takes her a few quarters to figure out when she gets a shock to the system. And unfortunately, this inflationary environment we've lived in for the last couple of years has been a shock and maybe even a double shock to her.  But she's starting to figure it out. You can see it through the transaction data. You can see it on the unit side, and you can see it even on the mix side. She's starting to pick up a little bit more of that nonconsumable-type items, that discretionary item a little bit more each and every passing week that we see. So there's a lot of reason to believe that this markdown activity will actually help encourage her to get out and spend more at Dollar General at a time where she needs us most. Kelly Dilts : Yes. And just to kind of give you a cadence just off of exactly what Todd was talking about, as we think about moving through the year, Q1 is certainly our [indiscernible] from a sales perspective. But as Todd talked about on the markdown side of things, it's really -- it's a cadence thing more than just being impactful on gross margin overall for the year. And so last year, our markdown cadence, because it was more clearance related, was back half heavy. This year, because we're leaning into the promotional cadence, just getting back to more normal rates, you'll see that spread a little bit more evenly over the quarters.  The other thing that we're looking at is just annualizing the retail labor hour investment. And so that's going to put some pressure on Q1. And then the -- we talked about shrink being 100 basis points or more above in -- year-over-year in Q4. And so with that exit rate, you're going to see some pressure in the front half of the year as well.  I think importantly, as we think about the cadence overall, the momentum of the actions that we are taking, we're certainly pleased with what we're seeing now, but that's going to continue to build. And we're going to see top line improve as we move through the quarter and a strong bottom line growth as we move into the back half of the year. If we think through just the components -- and back to your original question just on the gross margin piece, from a headwinds perspective, you've heard us talk a lot about shrink, but we do think with all of the actions that we're taking that we're going to be able to bend that trend as we move into the back half of the year and certainly start to see some benefits there. But really, as we move into 2025, we're going to see sales mix headwind probably all year as they make trade-off in the aisles, but as Todd alluded to, it's nice to see that we are starting to move that discretionary items as well.  And then on the tailwind side, lots of work done in supply chain. You've heard us talk about the efficiencies there and just structural improvement on that. And the inventory reductions are going to help, again, with shrink, but also with damages. DG Media Network continues to grow. We continue to like what we see there as well as private brands. So those are kind of the components as we think about the margin.  And then just a couple of things on SG&A. Obviously, retail labor has played into our baseline that it's little bit Q1 impact there, just based off of the annualization. And then the incentive compensation will pressure us throughout all of the quarters, and we call that out as a $0.50 headwind that we're estimating for the current -- for the 2024 year. And then depreciation cost increases over the prior year. So those are really the puts and takes as we think about the flow and just the different components of both gross margin and SG&A. Operator : Our next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Just wanted to talk a little bit more about inventory. I think the total inventory was up and with the decline in discretionary inventory, I think it means that the consumable inventory might have been up maybe 19% or 20%. So I was wondering if you could just talk about that, if that's related to SKU changes. And just in general, when do you expect to get into a normalized inventory position really across both categories? Kelly Dilts : Yes. No, I think the teams have done a lot of nice work on inventory, and you're absolutely right on what you're thinking about as far as trajectory. I think that they've done a really good job here threading the needle. And so we're seeing both sides of that. We're seeing the nonconsumable side inventory drop on a per store basis. And to your point, we're seeing the consumables increase. But that's us getting improvements in our in-stock, which is helping to drive sales. So they're doing a good job of balancing both of those things. As we move into 2024, inventory continues to be a high priority for us. We see opportunity to reduce our inventory on a per store basis as we move through. And then as you know, as we do that, the benefits just continue for us. It lowers our carrier costs, and it continues to drive efficiencies both in the stores and in the distribution centers. It takes pressure off of both shrink and damages. And frankly, with the improved in-stocks, that just positions us better to serve our customers. Operator : Our next question is from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : I just want to circle back a little bit on Simeon's question, but just looking at it from the margin angle. It looks like operating margins this year are going to finish in the high 5%, low 6%, if we back out the incentive accrual. So when you look back to pre-COVID, you guys were running in that, call it, high 7%, mid-8% range. Just curious when you look ahead, now that the business is starting to stabilize, how quickly you think you could get back to those levels? And when you look at the P&L, what are the key ingredients to get you there? Todd Vasos : Yes. Chuck, thanks for the question. And I would tell you, what we feel good about right now is getting back to the basics here. All the work that we're doing, as I indicated, we're probably just crossing over that 35-yard line. And so a lot of moving parts yet, but I think you could tell by my voice, and I can tell you, if you were here in this building, you could see the enthusiasm and in our stores of what is starting to really start to take hold. And that is getting back to the fundamentals that have made this company successful over the years.  And a lot of it, the majority of it is not recreating the wheel, as I've said last quarter. It's taking tried and true items as well as processes and procedures and ensuring compliance. It's that simple in many instances.  Now some of these, though, unfortunately, that had gone awry in the last 12 to 18 months. We really need to take some time to get those back in line. So those -- some of those are margin related and those components of, but as those start to heal, shrink being the largest one of those, I believe that we'll be in a really good position, as Kelly indicated, especially to start delivering on that EPS growth of 10% plus. And that is really some of the good health of the business that would start to show up.  I feel good about that long-term algorithm. I feel good about this business as good as I ever felt. And quite frankly, I believe we have more drivers at our disposal today on driving that top line than we've ever had in the past, especially around the fresh network that we've got, the fresh food as well as all the work that we've done on NCI over the years and nonconsumables. That is just waiting for the customer to come back in. And as I indicated earlier, we're starting to see glimmers of her starting to come back in to that discretionary side. And we stand ready, willing, able with inventory, fresh inventory to get that done. So stay tuned. You know me, we're not going to stand still. We're going to push hard and get this thing moving as fast as we can, and we're off to a great start already here. Operator : Our final question is from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Corey Tarlowe : Great. You've seen now positive traffic for 2 quarters in a row, I believe. I was curious to get your thoughts. And within your outlook, what's embedded for traffic and ticket within your guide? And then if you could also maybe just touch on what you're expecting ahead from a wage standpoint and what's embedded in your guide as well there? Todd Vasos : Yes, sure. I'll start and pass it over to Kelly. Yes, the very back half of Q3, we started to see some good glimmers of positive traffic. And then as we move through Q4, we saw that sequentially increase. And not that we're giving Q1 guidance, but that's continued into Q1. And so we feel very good about what we're seeing on that traffic side. And we believe, again, by all these actions we're taking on getting back to the basics should manifest itself in a strong traffic growth as we continue to move into the quarters ahead. And that's why the comp guidance that we gave is so important because we believe that we can see that positive traffic.  Not only that, but all the work that we're doing to get back to basics here, get in stock not only helps that traffic. But what we're starting to see is -- and gives us confidence is that for the first time in many quarters, we're starting to see the trade down come back in. And we hadn't seen that for a few quarters. And quite frankly, it's been across every cohort, a customer that we track. So not only that higher income, all the way down to the lower income, we're seeing share gains. So great to see that. That means the work that we're doing is resonating and should also mean and manifest itself into long-term growth on that top line. Kelly Dilts : Absolutely right. And then on the wage side of things, I'll tell you, we feel really good about our wages. We've increased wages almost 30% since 2019 and feel we're in a good position there. We're not seeing a lot of stress on the wage front. So a more normalized annual wage growth is what we're expecting. And then with all of the investments that we've made in the labor hours, we feel like we are well positioned on that front in 2024. And all of that's considered in the guidance that we gave. So feel good about that as well. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
