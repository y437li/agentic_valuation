Garcia \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Welcome to the Valero Energy Corporation Reports 2014 First Quarter Results. My name is Bakiba and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Ashley Smith. Mr. Ashley Smith, you may begin. Ashley M. Smith:  Thank you, Bakiba. Good morning, welcome to our call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO, who will step down from the CEO position this Thursday; Joe Gorder, President and COO, who will become the CEO this Thursday; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Gene Edwards; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Now, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC. As noted in the release, we reported first quarter 2014 earnings of $828 million, or $1.54 per share. First quarter 2014 operating income improved over first quarter 2013, with gains in the refining and ethanol segments partly offset by a decrease in our former retail segment due to the spinoff of CST Brands in May 2013. The refining segment throughput margin in the first quarter of 2014 was $10.90 per barrel, which is an increase of $0.31 per barrel versus the first quarter of 2013. Decreases in gasoline and distillate margins in most regions and WTI discounts in the Mid-Continent relative to Brent were more than offset by increases in light sweet and sour crude oil discounts in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Also contributing to the higher throughput margin was our Quebec City refinery\u2019s increased consumption of cost-advantaged North American crude\u2019s in the first quarter. North American grades comprised 45% of the refinery\u2019s feedstock diet, up from 28% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and zero in the first quarter of 2013. This shows execution of our strategy to process more volumes of cost-advantaged North American crude. For color on crude pricing, the shifting of U.S. Mid-Continent crude supplies from Cushing to the U.S. Gulf Coast as pipeline flow rates ramped up in the first quarter drove WTI discounts versus Brent to narrow by $9.15 per barrel, while LLS discounts to Brent widened by $5.39 per barrel as crude inventories built in the U.S. Gulf Coast between the first quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014. Gulf Coast sour crude oil differentials to Brent also widened from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014 in response to the increasing supply of light sweet crude. The discounts for Mars and Maya relative to Brent increased by $4.10 per barrel and $8.76 per barrel, respectively. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.7 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 135,000 barrels per day versus the first quarter of 2013. Refining volumes were higher primarily due to less maintenance activity, which enabled the refineries to run at higher rates and capture margin. Refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter of 2014 were $4.00 per barrel, which is $0.21 per barrel higher than the first quarter of 2013, due primarily to increased energy costs on higher natural gas prices. I\u2019d like to highlight another item in our operations during the first quarter of 2014. The new hydrocrackers at Port Arthur and St. Charles ran well and at a combined feed rate of about 120,000 barrels per day, which is their stated capacity. The new hydrocrackers also contributed to an increase in yields of gasoline and distillates and a reduction in the yields of other lower-value products. The ethanol segment delivered record first quarter earnings, generating $243 million of operating income versus $14 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2013. Increased gross margin was driven by weather-related supply disruptions, low industry ethanol inventories, low ethanol imports, and lower corn costs relative to the first quarter of 2013. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.1 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2014, which is higher than first quarter 2013 but lower versus the fourth quarter of 2013 due to production slowdowns caused by weather-related rail congestion. As noted in the earnings release, we acquired an idled 110 million gallon per year ethanol plant in Mount Vernon, Indiana, for $34 million in March. Efforts are underway to restart the facility, and production is expected to resume in the third quarter of this year. Given the favorable ethanol margin environment, we like the returns potential for this new facility. General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $160 million in the first quarter of 2014. Net interest expense was $100 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense was $421 million. The effective tax rate was 33.9%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter-end, total debt was $6.6 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $3.6 billion of which $384 million was held by Valero Energy Partners LP. Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 14.3% excluding cash held by Valero Energy Partners. Valero had approximately $5.4 billion and Valero Energy Partners had $300 million of available liquidity in addition to cash. Given our financial strength and favorable outlook for refining margin conditions last week S&P affirmed our BBB investment credit rating and raised our outlook from negative to stable. Cash flows in the first quarter included $517 million of capital expenditures, which included $129 million for turn arounds and catalyst. In the first quarter, we return $359 million in cash to our stockholders by paying $133 million dividend and by purchasing approximately $4.3 million shares of Valero common stock for $226 million. For 2014, we maintain our guidance for capital expenditures including turnaround and catalyst at approximately $3 billion. We expect stay-in business capital to account for approximately 50% of total spending and for the reminder to be allocated to strategic growth investments, which are primarily for logistics and light crude oil process and projects. For modeling, our second quarter operations you should expect refinery group of volumes to fall with in the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.42 million to 1.47 million barrels per day, U.S. mid-continent at 370,000 to 390,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 260,00 to 280,00 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be around $4.20 per barrel, for our ethanol operations in the second quarter, we expect total production volumes of $3.5 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expense excluding depreciation for the second quarter to be around $160 million and net interest expense should be around $95 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter should be approximately $410 million and our effective tax rate should be around 35%. Okay Bakiba, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment we\u2019ll open the call to questions. Just want to remind our callers that during this segment we would like to limit you each turn to questions. You can always jump back into the queue for additional questions. Okay Bakiba, we\u2019re ready. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). And our first question is going to come from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead your line is open. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey guys, good morning. William R. Klesse: Good morning Paul. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: When I looking at your buyback into first quarter is $226 million, in January from your last conference call you said $204 million. So when we looking at say in February and March, the decision that to slowdown the buyback, most there, can you help us understand what is the thinking? What is the criteria, when you determine that, how much you want to buyback? William R. Klesse:  So this is Clark. We were basically out of the market in February, and March because of our pending management change, which our legal advice was we could not be up buying our stock and then in March because of the earnings, the whole period of February, March and then in the April here with the earnings. So we've really just been, in a way, blacked out or locked out of the market. There's no change in our strategy here. Returning cash to the shareholders, and our dividend, which we raised in January, and then buying our shares. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Second question (indiscernible) that I mean how fast do you guys want to grow the LP EBITDA or distribution growth you want to talk about during the initial year. I think that's two school of thought amongst some of your peers, one is that want to grow the LP as quickly as they could so that they would get to a size they can use their own balance sheet to raise that to fund future growth. The other school is that they want to be just in the high teen what is the school of thought that you guys belong. Joseph W. Gorder:  Hey, Paul, this is Joe. If you look at our peer group in this, and we're really talking about the sponsored MLP's, we consider Phillips and Marathon to be the two, and you know, Phillips has said publicly they're going to grow their distribution to 20% to 25% range. Marathon is at a range slightly below that, we understand, and we tend to focus on the higher end of the range, so we're targeting 20%, 22%, 23%, distribution growth, annually going forward. And our approach will be do it, initially with drop down assets that are same type of assets that we did, when we did the initial assets in, which are those with very gradable, stable cash flows, based on fee based income. So we're going to target the timing for our first drop to be early part of the second half of this year. And then I would think, although we can't give that kind of direction, it should increase cash flows, and distribution increases should follow. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Joe, can we still assume that the MLP assets sitting in the C Corp. today is somewhere in the $300 million to $400 million for you? Joseph W. Gorder: Paul, the range that we talk about is actually higher than that. I would say we're in the $800 million EBITDA range that we believe we could drop. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. And before I finish that Gene and Bill congratulation on the retirement thank you for all the years of your insight, we appreciate. And best of luck, and have a lot of fun. But don\u2019t spend too much time in the (indiscernible). William R. Klesse: Thanks Paul. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question on the call from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead your line is open. Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. William R. Klesse: Good morning, Roger. Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Could we talk a little bit about Gulf Coast volumes here in the second quarter and then within that broader kind of expectation, generally speaking, volume has been better in the last two quarters, then I think kind of or at the higher end of the range of expectations, can you walk us through what's happening in the Gulf Coast and then maybe what could push that to the higher end of the range again. R. Lane Riggs :  This is Lane Riggs, are you asking in terms of our performance or the overall industries of Gulf Coast. Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Specific to you. William R. Klesse: Specific to us, when you look at sort of quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year, our turn around activity was lower, in the first quarter we set little bit higher in the second quarter. In terms of our volumes, that you'll see our second quarter volumes will be a little bit lower in terms of Gulf Coast, that we have a bigger turn around period. In terms of North American crude, the light crude processing that we have versus our capacity. We still have about a 165 a day versus our capacity that we could have run, and this was largely due that we have, you know, medium sour and heavy sour looks still quite competitive in the first quarter versus our capacity that we just still run about 165. Other than that, we are signaled to run forward or near sort of full as our availability would allow. Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. Could you walk us through what the turnarounds are in the Gulf Coast in Q2 to the extent that you want to the specific units or type of work that\u2019s being done? William R. Klesse: We choose not to disclose that until after the turnarounds, until the following quarter when the turnarounds are complete. The numbers are in terms of the overall volume metric they were actually the initial comments in terms of the guidance on the volume. Michael S. Ciskowski: So what happened here is this is all legal advice and some of things that have happened in the markets. We\u2019ve changed our policy on this. I think some of you have noticed, so we no longer announce our turnarounds ahead of time. And so you just have to rely on the guidance that Ashley gives you as the volumes we\u2019re looking at. Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC:  Okay. Well as long as we know who to blame if it doesn't go other way it was supposed to go. Michael S. Ciskowski: Well, blame Ashley. Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: There you go. Just a last question here that, condensate we\u2019re hearing to lot more about that becoming a bigger and bigger issue and even in some parts of West Texas where it's being rejected. I was wondering, what are you seeing along the Gulf Coast or any other part of your operations, in terms of condensate. Are you having any rejection issues, in terms of what's being delivered to the units and then what your thoughts are on, how Valero may deal with the condensate issue not worrying so much about, you know, the industry with condensate splitters, et cetera. Gary Simmons : Hey, Roger, this is Gary Simmons. I would say in the Gulf we haven't had too much of an issue with getting light material to our crude units. We have taken a hard look at the condensate. We don't really see that the discounts are wide enough to really warrant a capital investment to be able to run a lot larger volumes of condensates in the Gulf Coast. We are taking a heavy look at this in the Permian basin in some regions and kind of getting with producers and seeing where they're seeing the production to see if there is some opportunity, but right now we don't have anything planned. Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC:  Okay, thank you. Operator :  Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead your line is open. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning guys. And firstly congratulate to Bill and Eugene and your careers and retirement to Joe and the new role to come May. My first question really for Bill, and it's obviously more general and somewhat reflective question. I mean as you think about your 40 plus year career with Valero, and it\u2019s predecessors and lot has changed and how do you think about the current Valero and how it stacks up, relative to your history, and just your outlook today for the company versus other periods of time? William R. Klesse:  Okay. Well, the independents are a bigger segment of the business today than it used to be for sure, and I think that will continue. So that's one of the major changes in refining is that the independent segment has far more weight, and I think we react quicker to market influences. But Valero, we\u2019re a company that\u2019s put together bunch of assets and a bunch of people. Some of those assets were under invested in some were operated very poorly. But we come together with one culture and we have one goal, and it\u2019s really to perform with excellence. We\u2019ve improved our operations tremendously over the last few years, we\u2019re a for more reliable operators are much, much better operator, in that thanks goes to our people being very focused on excellence, respect for each other, hard work, safety, and teamwork. Valero is one company and you knowing our history, all the acquisitions, but we\u2019re one company. This business, though, far it's going to continue to be volatile, it will be seasonal, but it\u2019s made up a very hard working people and I always like the point this out to people, this industry pays taxes and we give a product to society that makes peoples lives better. The world needs the oil and gas for regardless of the rhetoric that people talk about. Oil and gas is inexpensive, and it, I mean, frankly, the developing world has have oil and gas. All the alternatives, and we know them all and we know all the cost structures, and except for ethanol, that has been able to work into the fuel mix all the rest of these alternatives are too expensive, inefficient, and will do absolutely nothing to improve the environment. And it's a waste of money. Well, I think we're very competitive very well, competitively positioned, and we had value to society, and Valero has a very bright future and no question that the crude oil and natural gas that\u2019s happening in North America is the biggest thing in my career, and I'm sure in Gene's as well, and its having a tremendous influence on all manufacturing in the United States that people thought was really last forever because the jobs in our industry really do allow people to on their own educate their kids and retire with benefits. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  That\u2019s great. I have a second question. There is a current debate regarding the impact of current battery, crude inventories are well above five year highs and a continuing heavy turnaround through the second quarter of this year and just how fold the system might be as it relates to Gulf Coast crude differentials. I know batteries are big place, I was wondering if you comment on what you\u2019re seeing in the physical inventory market. I know you have talked on the conversation side, but how many tank tops are general inventory levels that you\u2019re seeing in various Gulf Coast storage reasons, I'll leave it at that. Thanks. Gary Simmons : David this is Gary Simmons. If you look at the BOE stats from last week, we\u2019re 209 million when we combined the refinery tankage with third-party terminals we would say that the working capacity in the Gulf is somewhere in the 2.75 range so that puts you about 76% of overall working capacity that\u2019s being utilized today. We\u2019re not seeing problems in the Gulf and there are some areas that it does appears starting to get pretty full with the SPR release loop seems pretty full, one of the things that we\u2019re seeing is our barrels are showing up faster than they used to. So the third-party terminal operators aren\u2019t sitting on inventory. They\u2019re turning those barrels pretty fast, and they\u2019re showing up it our refineries sites a little bit faster than what we\u2019ve seen in the past, but no real issues that we\u2019ve seen thus far. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Great, I appreciate it guys. Gary Simmons : Thanks Evan. Operator : Thank you, and then our next question is going to come from Edward Westlake from Credit-Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open. Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse :  Yes and let me also say congratulations, 650 I think is the EPS consensus not quite the $8 you guys did in the boom times, but certainly Valero looks like in good shape, just a follow on question on the MLP. I mean, obviously it\u2019s a great currency as well not just for what you can drop down into it, trading at a 2% yield. Maybe think a little bit more broadly about talking to us about what you envisage the MLP to allow you to do over the next several years, potentially external M&A as well as the drop down. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder:  Yes. Okay, this is Joe. It\u2019s a good question. I mean, obviously the drop downs are the primary focus for the strategy in the short-term, but we do realize that we\u2019ve got a very competitive currency to use to do other transactions. You know, I think if you look at the logistics investment that Valero is making this year, and it will continue to make next year. In docks, we even have the rails, we\u2019ve got pipe investments that we\u2019re making and looking at. We\u2019re going to continue to build the logistics portfolio at Valero Energy that will allow us to look to drop for an extended period of time, which really just eliminates the need to go into the market to pay a premium for assets. So we find that to be a great benefit to us, but we would not hesitate to look at what\u2019s available in the marketplace, and to consider those assets and to use the currency to acquire those assets, but we felt that they fit into the system, and they were really assets that Valero Energy felt good about being able to make commitments to provide in that ratable, cash flow stream going forward. Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. And then a specific question on \u2013 and condensate has been team so far this call, but say you look at your sort of more mid-continent refineries Ardmore and Mckee, as you look at the crude that\u2019s coming into those refineries, presume say it\u2019s, WTI mix a lot of refineries are starting to complain that WTI isn\u2019t the same WTI used to be, because obviously condensates are spiked into it. Do you have any color on o how the sort of gravity of that WTI has changed over time or where we are against the sort of 42 API speck Unidentified Company Representative :  Yes. I would say both Ardmore and Mckee, we definitely see a trend toward the crude getting lighter and it has caused some operating issues for us, some constraints where we have to cut rates, because the gravity of the crude is getting higher. So we try to control at the best we can with working with producers to control the quality of the barrels that we\u2019re getting, but we have seen issues with the barrels getting lighter. Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : I mean, I guess I\u2019ll ask the direct I should have asked, which is do you think there will be a point where the really light crude will need its own infrastructure rather than being blended into the TI stream. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, I do I think ultimately we\u2019ll have to do that because the refineries just can reject the light ends. Unidentified Company Representative : But how that structure comes out remains to be seen, I\u2019m not necessarily sure you\u2019re going to see a gathering system, but you may see some type of fractionation that occurs that allows it to move from the field economically into these hubs and then get address that hub before it then moves to the refiners. There\u2019s a lot, but just think that there is - you wouldn't necessarily think you're going to have a whole pipeline network to handle this, but you may have fractionation occur at different places in the system, including at the refinery. Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Yes. Which would be an opportunity for you guys in the MLP? William R. Klesse: That\u2019s right. Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And then our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead. You line is open. Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International: Good morning. It\u2019s Jeff Dietert. William R. Klesse: Good morning, Jeff. Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International: Good morning. My congratulations to Bill and Gene and appreciate all you education and knowledge and being an industry statement for the last many years. I\u2019d like to focus on some of the medium sour crudes on the Gulf Coast. I think there have been a lot of discussion about light crudes coming in and more competition between light and medium. Yet, when you look at the Ed Mars, it's trading 5.5 under LLS, which is wider than average over the last 18 months. And you look at Thunder Horse, Southern Green Canyon some of that medium sours and trading at nice discounts as well. Obviously, the 700 a day keystone south pipeline is started up and we have got SPR putting medium crude into the market. Could you talk about how significant of these factors are and maybe other considerations you believe are driving the wide discounts from medium crudes in the Gulf Coast, and maybe how sustainable that weakness will be. William R. Klesse: Yes. So I think we\u2019ve been fairly consistent in our view that\u2019s you know the medium sours and the heavy sours are going to have to trade at a quality adjusted differentials to the light sweet and as the light sweets are pressured down, the medium sours and the heavy sours are going to have to follow. I agree with your comments certainly in the short-term, the medium sours followed with the SBR release pressured the medium sours down in the Gulf a little bit more than what we had seen especially in the first quarter. But overall, I think we'll see that trend continued. Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International: And your LP's are viewing that you should run near maximum rates, given where discounts are, and crack spreads are and just looking at the high levels of inventory reasonable U.S. demand and increasing product exports? William R. Klesse: Yes, I think as Lane commented, the LP's are really pushing toward maximum utilization across the system. Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International: Thanks for your comments. William R. Klesse: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. And then our next question is on the call from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead Paul. Your line is open. Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, good morning everyone. William R. Klesse: Good morning, Paul. Paul L. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Bill and Joe congratulations indeed to both of you, and again as always I said, thanks for being so much fun to deal with over the years and so interesting to deal with. Could we just talk a bit about Gulf Coast again sorry to go back to this, but the throughput number could you just remind me what that was in terms of what you expected to be in the second quarter could you just repeat for to make it easier what you did in the first quarter and then could you also talk about what your capacity is now on the Gulf Coast, what you think your refining throughput capacity is overall. Thanks. William R. Klesse: Yes, Paul. In the first quarter our throughput was 1.585 billion barrels per day. Our guidance was one for the second quarter is 1.42 million to 1.47 million barrels per day. And I'm going to get an updated capacity. Capacities is around a total throughput, just over 1.6 million barrels per day. Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Okay, so I\u2019ve got that 1.6 and then I think it was officially 1.54 last year and then so it\u2019s to be so detailed here, but then I think you gave a light weep throughput capacity as well for that system. R. Lane Riggs :  Yes. This is Lane Riggs. Just in the Gulf Coast it\u2019s about 480,000 barrels a day. Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : For you guys? R. Lane Riggs : Yes. Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Yes, okay that\u2019s interesting. The outlook for that as we move forward. Firstly, I guess that\u2019s a turn around number in Q4 that\u2019s the reason why you are so much lower, but then I suppose that we are going to go back up to much higher level of utilization through the rest of the year Q3, Q4. And then when we move forward beyond that, is your capacity going to increase let\u2019s say into 2015 or do you think you\u2019ve reached a steady state. Firstly for the overall capacity, second for the light sweep? Thanks. Sorry to miss the detail. R. Lane Riggs : Yes, Paul this is Lane again, we have the two crude unit project. So everything you said is true. But in terms of project we have in terms of our pipeline of project is our crude expansion for both Corpus Christi and Houston both of which will be somewhat finished towards the end of next year. So the capacity of those 90,000 barrels a day at Houston and 70,000 barrels of day in Corpus in terms of our additional capacity in the Gulf Coast were on light sweep. Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : And that would be at the end of 2015? William R. Klesse: Yes, we\u2019re calling kind of early 2016. So when those are operating. Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. And then the other question I have here is just related to the further outlet light sweep crude in terms of exports, can you just, again on a look forward basis talk about how much more oil you guys would be using in Canada and there is some line reversal stories as well as some shipping stories, thanks. William R. Klesse: Yeah, so what we said is our Canadian refinery should be at a 100% domestic light sweep by the end of the year, we\u2019re still on pace to complete that, we\u2019re a little bit ahead of schedule, I would probably have about a 130,000 barrels a day of capacity that we haven\u2019t utilized yet for the domestic light sweet. So if you take Lane\u2019s number in the gulf of 165 in the gulf plus 138 back here in this 295 range of capacity that we still have to absorb light sweet crude absence the capital program that we have. Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Well, understood. And is that the limit on what you can do absent the capital program I mean the only crew that you\u2019ll take up that is for your own use and your own refinery? William R. Klesse: So I guess I don\u2019t understand which you are asking? R. Lane Riggs : Well you may and we can ship out there and sell it to one of the other refineries in Canada? Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, exactly whether\u2026 R. Lane Riggs : Our permit allows us to ship it to all four, I think of the company arriving and compensate with somebody else, I think it\u2019s four anyway. Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. And I guess additional final one and Bill, because it\u2019s presumably your last call, if you want to talk about how things have changed and or you think the outlook is in Washington D.C. Particularly I\u2019m wondering if you think will be able to export, condensate in relatively short order and then longer term, whether you feel that in due course potentially if prices in the U.S. get very low, we maybe exporting crude as well and any other thoughts you have on what\u2019s going on in Washington? Thanks. R. Lane Riggs : Well I do accept that the ground work is being laid for condensates to be an issue and that\u2019s all definition of what crude oil is and then the question was asked earlier about infrastructure, which is absolutely correct. So condensates may need to get addressed at some point. As far as exporting of crude, though, the industry is running the oil, the discounts we have in the marketplace today are really because of logistics in many of these markets. And we\u2019re doing things and I\u2019m sure everyone of our peer group are doing things to be able to run more oil, and then we support the free markets, but you need to remember that this business isn't very free. There\u2019s a lots of restrictions from the Jones Act and the cartels, to everything else that goes with it. So I think it remains to be seen, but under the law, there's a lot of flexibility. You can re-export Canadian crude, you can get licenses for that, as Gary just spoke, you have licenses to send U.S. domestic crude to Canada, there is also possibilities of exchanges, if it becomes so much, but the thing I think that people need to remember is this is a windfall for the North America and the United States as far as manufacturing, whether it's natural gas liquids, natural gas or crude oil, and we can have a manufacturing boom, the petrochemical industry can boom, where do you build petrochemical plants. Resource advantage, consumer advantage the U.S. is now resource advantaged. So this is a huge opportunity for jobs. We have a lot of rhetoric about jobs. Here is a real area for jobs. Job training, huge opportunities for welders, pipe fitters, instrument techs, operators, that was not here just five years ago. So this question of exports, and how our country should conduct themselves especially when you see the turmoil in the world, that we have going on, I think should take a lot of stuff. And I think it will. Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Great, thanks for your thoughts. Thank you guys. William R. Klesse:  Thanks, Paul. Operator :  Thank you, and then our next question is going to come from Faisel Kahn from Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open. Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Thanks. Hi, good morning guys. I\u2019m Faisel from Citi. If I could ask a question on the heavy oil sort of consumption in the Gulf Coast, just with all the things going on in Venezuela, what are the risks to you guys the volumes into your facilities, from heavy crude, you're taking from Venezuela and then to sort of counter that can you give us an update on how much heavy crude you're bringing down from Canada specifically through the pipeline into Port Arthur as well. Michael S. Ciskowski: Yes, our heavy sour volumes were fairly consistent from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. You brought up Venezuela, we did choose to allow our heavy sours inventories to creep up a little bit in the first quarter. In case we had a supply disruption from Venezuela. But we haven't seen any changes that would indicate that we would have a risk of supply loss from Venezuela. The Canadian values \u2013 Canadian volumes were down in the first quarter and that was mainly just a matter of pricing. The Canadian production \u2013 the heavy Canadian production was down somewhat due to weather and then demand was also a little higher with BP Whiting\u2019s coker coming online. So we didn\u2019t see the economic incentive to run the Canadians in the first quarter that we have seen in the fourth quarter and early. That incentive is starting to come back and so we are ramping the Canadians back into Port Arthur here in April. Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Its okay, understood. And can you also give us an update on what your strategic thinking is with the California assets, has that changed at all, and here what\u2019s the \u2013 process going on or, how are you guys thinking about those particular assets? William R. Klesse:  Well. In California obviously our financial performance is not that great. It is our weakest group of assets now financially, operationally though it\u2019s excellent. We have a very solid asset, they are operated very well. We continue to make improvements on those assets. And so when you look at the basic issue of supply demand where demand has not really recovered out there at all from pretty great recession, although we're starting to some improving economy and some optic in demand. To focus that we have is to work on our crude costs and to continue to work on the operating costs and of course, adjusting our yields to fit the market. So we view it as some of our competitors publicly stated that in a way, it's an option value out there. It's a huge market. The LA basin is still absolutely a huge gasoline market, and so the markets there, we just needed to show a little bit of growth back to levels it was before. Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Okay, understood. And then last question for me. Can you give us an update on the methanol plan to alkylation unit projects and sort of when you might think of sort of sanctioning those projects? R. Lane Riggs : Hi, this is Lane Riggs, where we are \u2013 we're in the Phase II and Phase III process in terms of working on ethanol, which means were doing a more detailed engineering to get a better cost of fine tuner economics, we will bring the project forward for a Phase III review, around November this year, and we'll probably have sort no go on the project at that time, but so far the project looks very, very favorable until there is no show stopper at this point time with respect to that project Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Okay, great. I appreciate the time guys. William R. Klesse:  Hey thanks Faisel. Operator : Thank you. And then our next question is from the Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody, Bill, Joe and everybody congratulations. It\u2019s you have been agree educator build for the industry and will miss you at the grantee for sure. But good luck to all of you. My two questions if I may, first of all on the Gulf Coast, I think Lane made a comment earlier, but well refinery utilization, but I don\u2019t would like to go to the industry utilization. We have seen the big build in inventories, but we have also seen our step changing utilization rates and as I look at it, if you want to characterize it, our supply days of crude on the Gulf Coast, are actually near the lowest level seasonally, that we have seen in quite some times. And this one if you guys could comment on that. And what it means for working capital for the industry and for Valero specifically as you move through utilization rates higher on the Gulf Coast. I got have follow-up. Please? R. Lane Riggs : Well. This is Lane. And I will take a little bit of short at as days of supply I will differ to my friend list, but in terms of we absolutely had a, if you look at our crude margins, from the LP guide. We have had a huge incentive, to run through all the first quarter and fully with the margin refineries exist today so if you want turnaround or if you are having issues, you're trying to run crude, and you are not only trying to crude and crude still for example we are running crude in some of our SPC's, two or three of our SPC's where we have the ability to run resin, we are running crude in all of that so the industry is doing quite a bit in terms of trying to run more crude, because that\u2019s where the economic people\u2019s are telling us the range and I don\u2019t know if you want to talk on employees. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, so the days is hard working capital in general \u2013 we generally see our domestic refineries that are taking ratable pipeline deliveries require less working capital than some of our Gulf Coast assets and our view was as we switch to more domestic barrels that would drive down working capital, I\u2019m not sure I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell that, and some of its just we're not sure what our pipeline line fill capacities are going to be on some of these new lines to be able to really give you guidance on that at this time. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  I guess sort on what I\u2019m really trying to figure out is I mean \u2013 but all looking at the differential on the Gulf Coast there has been obviously a consensus expectation that was going to blow out again probably for all of us and it hasn\u2019t at least in the magnitude in prior quarters we\u2019ve had down time. And I guess what I\u2019m really trying to understand is are you guys seeing the same sort of indications that we are, which is that days of supply for the system as a whole, is actually still quite tight given the higher utilization rates or are you not seeing that at all? Unidentified Company Representative : It appears to me that the market in the Gulf is well supplied today. So I don\u2019t know that I have actually looked at it in terms of days of supply, but the market seems well supplied. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. My follow-up really hopefully quick, one more Valero specific. The comment you made earlier about you are seeing a lightening of the crude slate or for WTI specifically and that's becoming more problematic I guess in terms of filling up some of your secondary units. Can you talk about what that's doing to you\u2019re capture rates relative to the legacy capture rate of the system. I guess what I\u2019m really trying to get to is, we\u2019ve seen capture rates drift a little bit lower versus indicators and I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s got something to do with it in terms of incremental challenges you are having on running those crudes and I\u2019ll leave it there. Unidentified Company Representative :  It\u2019s difficult for me to comment exactly with that does in terms of running lighter in terms of where the capture rates go we could look at that in more detail. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  I\u2019ll take it off-line thanks guys. Unidentified Company Representative :  Thanks Doug. Operator :  Thank you, and then our next question is going to come from Sam Margolin from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead, your line is open. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen and Company : Thanks, good morning everybody. I\u2019ll just echo the congrats to Bill, Gene and Joe not a whole lot I could add, but I would be remised if I didn\u2019t say thanks and I think its going to continue to be\u2026 Unidentified Company Representative : Hey, Sam. You may have to rejoin because we are hearing some weird feedback coming through. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen and Company : Is it better now? Unidentified Company Representative : Every time you do it, it sounds like you are playing a videogame. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen and Company : Really? Unidentified Company Representative : Yeah, yeah. You might have to rejoin we\u2019ll wait for you. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen and Company : Okay, thanks. Operator :  And our next question is going to come from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead your line is open. Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil : Guys, good morning hopefully you can hear me a little bit better. Unidentified Company Representative : It sounds good Blake. Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil : Okay good. Congrats also to Bill, Gene and Joe, its great working with all you guys. Two quick ones for you. One, you mentioned the Quebec refinery and potential reversals of line nine, of course I know you are barging Eagle Ford crude up there as well. I\u2019m just curious if you could talk abut how you see the economics unfolding, I guess I always viewed pipeline as more efficient than barging crude, although I believe you kind of outlined about $2 cost of barging on a non-Jones Act vessel. So I\u2019m just curious once the. line comes on, do you think we'll start or maybe reduce the amount of the Eagle Ford barge crude up there? Gary K. Simmons:  Yes. This is Gary Simmons. I guess the way we would see it is that the pipeline delivery would be the most advantaged and then second to that would be the barrels that we get over the water, and then finally would be the tranche that were currently taking by rail. So if barrels starts to drop off it would probably be the rail volume that you would see fall off before the volume that we are taking over the water. Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil : Okay, great. The second one for you quickly there is some press reports out there that the Milford Haven refinery will be closed next month, obviously you\u2019ll get a direct benefit of Pembroke with those volumes being offline, but I\u2019m just curious if there is any opportunity to maybe buy some units or specific assets from that facility that would enhance Pembroke\u2019s performance? William R. Klesse: Well, this is Klesse, we\u2019re fully aware of what\u2019s going on there and we are not sure how this is all going to work out and if there is an opportunity for us to improve our situation at Pembroke will take a look at it, but as of today we don\u2019t have anything moving on direct. Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Michael S. Ciskowski: Thanks, Blake. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Chi Chow for Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead, your line is open. Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.: Okay, thank you. I want to go back to the Canadian strategy, and it\u2019s been reported you\u2019ve got this application for re-export license of Canadian crude. And first have you receive that permit yet and then secondly can you just discuss the strategy with the permit and what\u2019s the strategy on moving volumes out to either backup by if I guess to Qu\u00e9bec or out of Pembroke from what I understand that\u2019s part of permit as well. Gary K. Simmons: Yes, this is Gary Simmons, we do have the permit in place, some of that why we went out and got that, actually when we are having the weather problems moving the Canadian barrels by rail to Qu\u00e9bec, we wanted to be able to shift that volume and move the rail volume to the gulf and then be able to bring it up over the water to Qu\u00e9bec, and weren\u2019t allow to do that. So this permit will allow us to do that, certainly at some point in time that we could also look at taking volume to Pembroke, but today we don\u2019t have any plans to do that least in the short term. Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.: Does the permit allow you specifically to move to Pembroke only or that open to destinations within Europe or the U.K.? Gary K. Simmons: I\u2019m not sure on the specific for that. Michael S. Ciskowski: I think in the permit, you actually identified and I believe or you have nine different places were allowed to take it in the permit and you actually have to specify and so you asked the philosophy or strategy question, the strategy is that flexibility. We have the assets going in place with rail and at the U.S. gulf coast that allows us to keep the crude oil and that allow us to plan to go ahead and keep it segregated and then if the economics so there we have flexibility in our system. Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.: Okay, Bill that the nine different places are they all with in your own facilities at Valero? Michael S. Ciskowski: No, there are not. Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.: I\u2019m just wondering is in our your best interest to keep as much crude in the gulf as possible and what point would you look to I guess execute on this part and moving the crude down? Michael S. Ciskowski: It\u2019s all flexibility and this is about economics and we would do exactly what years have leading to is always in our self interest for our shareholder. Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then I guess second question, can you give us the product export volumes in the first quarter and what the capacity is for both gas and diesel at this point. Gary K. Simmons:  Sure, this is Gary Simmons again in the first quarter we exported 208,000 barrels of distillate. We would say that our capacity the day is close to 325 and we have some capital projects in the work that will bring that up to 425 on the gasoline side we exported a 124,000 barrels a day of gasoline in the first quarter and that capacity is probably in the 225 range it will also go up to about 250 with some of the dock work we have going on. Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks Gary, any timing on the increase in the capacity on both products. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, so the dock work is probably a year to two years away from being complete. Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.: Okay and then one final question on the exports have you noticed any impact from some of the new refineries that have coming to the market and most notably I guess that you\u2019ve well planned in Saudi Arabia. Gary K. Simmons: We\u2019ll still see a margin today a good margin to export when you take the RIN into account and so we were finding plenty of homes to take the barrel. So I don\u2019t say that, I can\u2019t say that we\u2019ve seen a big impact from that. Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.:  Okay, great, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is going to come from Sam Margolin Cowen & Company. Please go ahead your line is open. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, coming through okay. William R. Klesse: Sounds good. Joseph W. Gorder: Great. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for let me back I\u2019ll keep it tight I wanted to, I think that was brought up earlier the connection between sort of utilization and capture rate I think one of the moving parts there might be intermediate feedstock costs, seems to be like one of the last remaining sort of structural challenges I bring it up because you guys are addressing it with crude units and I was just curious of if any of those economics are changing if there is an opportunity at this stage to make them bigger or add another one or even drop them down and put a toll on it because kind of the commodity structure is looking more favorable? R. Lane Riggs :  Hi, Sam this is Lane Riggs so our both crude units, that we did we are big as \u2013 as large that could be in enter the green house gas. So we don\u2019t really have the opportunity to make them larger at this point time about reporting without going through the process to getting the green house gas. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, and then I guess I will just bring up Maya, Brent spreads have been pretty favorable I think some of that has to do with WTS and Midlands kind of I guess leakage of the price dislocations there and West pipelines the infrastructure start to come online at a West Texas and maybe Midland normalizers closer to, closer to other benchmarks and then WTS comes with it if you guys are expecting any kind of weird price action in Maya maybe in the third quarter and if there is something we should prepare or try to bake in ahead a time to our estimates. Michael S. Ciskowski:  Well, I think with the Maya formula there is always that risk that if Midland comes into Cushing that it can affect that Maya formula in the short-term but we believe they\u2019re trying to price their crude so it can be competitive with Mars and so that even if Midland comes in they would eventually adjust the K to keep their crude competitive with a medium seller alternative. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you so much. Have a good one. Michael S. Ciskowski: Thanks Sam. Operator :  Thank you. Then our next question is going to come from Cory Garcia from Raymond James. Please go ahead Cory your line is open. Cory J. Garcia \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Thanks good morning Bill, definitely want to echo everyone start and that\u2019s what it is going forward for Bill and Gene. Most of my questions have already been answered. But I guess as follow up to Faisel earlier Lane do you have any sort of no go, no go timeline on the Al key unit that you guys as talked about, obviously, a little bit lower stop in the scale of project, but just wondering if you have a similar sort of training for us to at least keep an eye out for. R. Lane Riggs : It's on a similar time line. We'll have the same sort of base to review in the fourth quarter with management and then make to sort of the similar decision. Cory J. Garcia \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. William R. Klesse:  So listen, for those of you have a still on the call, and it was mentioned several times, this is Gene and my last call with you all. And I just wanted to Gene and I both wanted to tell you guys. Thank you very much for the interest you\u2019ve shown in Valero and we wish all of you all the best going forward. So thank you very much for that. Ashley M. Smith:  Thank you, Bill. Thank you and we appreciate everyone calling in and listening to the call today have additional questions please contact our Investor Relations department. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Sylvia, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to John Locke. John Locke, you may begin. John Locke : Thank you, Sylvia. Good morning. Welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our CEO and President; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Now, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC. As noted in the release, we reported second quarter 2014 earnings from continuing operations of $651 million or $1.22 per share. For all period shown in the table that accompany the earnings release, our results of operations reflect our Aruba Refinery as discontinued operations and we recognize $63 million of charges in the second quarter of 2014 associated with the recording asset retirement and other obligations related to our Aruba Refinery. Second quarter 2014 operating income improved over second quarter 2013 with gains in the refining in ethanol segments partly offset by a decrease in the retail segment due to the spin-off CST brand in May 2013. The refine segment throughput margin in the second quarter of 2014 was $9.84 per barrel, which is an increase of $0.58 per barrel versus the second quarter of 2013. Decreases in gasoline and distillate margins relative to Brent in most regions and narrower WTI discounts in the Mid-Continent relevant -- relative to Brent were more than offset by wider discounts on light sweet medium sour and heavy crude oil in the Gulf Coast. Also contributing to the higher throughput margin was our Quebec City refinery\u2019s increased consumption of North American light crude in the second quarter. North American grades composed 83% of the refinery\u2019s feedstock diet, up from 45% in the first quarter of 2014 and up from 8% in the second quarter of 2013. Additionally, at our St. Charles refinery we have began processing Canadian bitumen by our new crude-by-rail unloading facility. The U.S. crude supply landscape continue to transition in the second quarter with oil stock shifting from the Mid-Continent to the Gulf Coast, the inventory reduction in Cushing and corresponding oil supply growth in the Gulf Coast led to a $2.49 per barrel decline in the WTI discount to Brent and $5.19 per barrel increase in the LLS discount to Brent compared to the second quarter of 2013. Gulf Coast sour crude oil differentials to Brent also widened over the same time period due to increase in supply of crude oil. The discounts for Mars and Maya relative to Brent increased by $4.69 per barrel and $8.49 per barrel, respectively. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.7 million barrels per day in the second quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 115,000 barrels per day versus the second quarter of 2013. Less turnaround activity and higher utilization rates spurred by the increase availability of discounted North American light crude in the Gulf Coast led to the increase in refining throughput volumes. Refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter of 2014 were $3.90 per barrel, which is $0.07 per barrel greater than the second quarter of 2013, due mainly to higher energy costs. The ethanol segment generated $187 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2014 versus $95 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2013. The increase in operating income was mainly due to a $0.39 per gallon increase gross margin which was driven by lower corn prices on an abundant corn crop and low industry ethanol inventories at the start of the quarter. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.3 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2014, which were lower than the second quarter of 2013 due to production slowdown caused by lingering rail congestion in the Mid-Continent. Now looking at the third quarter for ethanol, we expect volumes to increase with the startup of our recently acquired plan in Mount Vernon, Indiana, given the favorable ethanol margin environment we look forward to this plant\u2019s contributions. General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $170 million in the second quarter of 2014. Net interest expense was $98 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $414 million. The effective tax rate was 34.3%. Now with respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $6.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $3.5 billion of which $382 million was held by Valero Energy Partners. Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 14.1% excluding cash held by Valero Energy Partners. Valero had approximately $5.8 billion and Valero Energy Partners had $300 million of available liquidity in addition to cash. Cash flows in the second quarter included $806 million of capital expenditures of which $240 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. We also repaid $200 million of debt that matured in April. In the second quarter we return $361 million in cash to our shareholders, which included $133 million in dividend payments and $228 million in purchasing of approximately $4 million shares of Valero common stock. Subsequent to the second quarter, we continue to return cash to stockholders by purchasing an additional 2.0 million share of common stock for $104 million. We also increased our regular quarterly dividend for the third of 2014 by $2.05 per share to $27.05 per share or $1.10 per share annualized. Also in the second quarter we announced the sale of the McKee crude system, the Three Rivers crude system and the Wynnewood Products system to Valero Energy Partners for $154 million. This transaction closed on July 1st and as an example of executing our strategy to create stockholder value to Valero Energy Partners. For 2014, we maintained our guidance for capital expenditures including turnarounds and catalyst at approximately $3 billion. We expect stay-in business capital to account for slightly under 50% of total spending and for the reminder to be allocated to strategic growth investments, primarily for logistics and advantage crude oil processing capability. I should add that approximately $870 million of Valero\u2019s estimated strategic capital spent for 2014 is all logistics and most of this is expected to be eligible for dropdown into Valero Energy Partners. Now for modeling, our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges, Gulf Coast at 1.45 million to 1.55 million barrels per day, Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be around $4 per barrel. For our ethanol operations in the third quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.6 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expense excluding depreciation for the third quarter to be around $165 million and net interest expense should be about $95 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter should be approximately $420 million and our effective tax rate should be around 35%. Okay. So we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we\u2019ll open the call to questions. During the segment we request that our callers limit each turn to two questions. They may rejoin the queue with additional questions after that. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Jeff Dietert - Simmons: Good morning. John Locke : Good morning, Jeff Joe Gorder : Good morning, Jeff Jeff Dietert - Simmons: I was hoping to hit on capital spending? You stand consistent with your $3 billion forecast for 2014. I was curious as you look forward continues to be an opportunity rich environment in your view more light processing, more logistics, perhaps on the logistics side do you see that as a steady trend or trend that accelerating as far as logistics investment opportunities? Joe Gorder : Hey. Good morning, Jeff. This is Joe. Yeah. I\u2019d say you raise a very good point. I mean, if you look at it broadly, we are going to maintain a very balanced approach with the use of cash returning it to shareholders via the dividends and buybacks. And then, investing to maintain the quality assets, which is, just a core part of our capital programs and then we are also investing to take advantages, natural resources advantage were enjoyed. Relative to the investment in logistics asset, I think what you would see now is a bit of shift in capital -- in the strategic capital from -- for example, we shift some of the spending for the purposed methanol plant for 2015 and we move the crude by rail facility up into 2014. So as the percentage, I think, that we have now is 54% of our strategy capital now is focused on logistics, where as previously, Jeff, is in the 40s. So the point that you make is one that we clearly agree with and recognize and so we\u2019ve seen a shift in that capital. Jeff Dietert - Simmons: Secondly, could you talk a little bit about your historical capital investment and what types of returns you\u2019re seeing so far from some of those investment, maybe hit on the hydrocracker investments at Port Arthur and St. Charles? What kind of returns are you seeing there based on their performance to date? Joe Gorder : Jay, go ahead. Jay Browning : Long time, yeah. Joe Gorder : Yeah. Jeff, I\u2019ll tell you what, you asked a question and I think you recognized that it\u2019s very difficult to look at unit within the refining complex and determine specifically what\u2019s the return to that is, because of all the interrelationship in the plant. I think we\u2019ve said in the past and we would continue to say that the hydrocracker project were very good investments. Project -- the units are running very well and Lane can speak to that and the projects that we are getting out of units are good, high-quality diesel fuel that we are able to export as EN 590 grades versus a conventional diesel fuel. So, although, I don\u2019t have a specific return on hydrocracker project per se for you, I\u2019ll tell you we are pleased with the investment. We think they have improved the quality of the portfolio and they are performing very well. Lane Riggs : Jeff, this is Lane. They\u2019ve averaged 120,000 combine units averaged 120,000 barrels in the second quarter. They\u2019ve definitely earned very well. These are great units. We are currently in the process of performing a test run at our St. Charles Refinery. It\u2019s I don\u2019t want to. I would be careful not to say what they are, where we are on that. But it certainly allows us to look at a very limited opportunistic capital investment. Those units are really bring them up to essentially all about the equipment and the sizes. But they\u2019ve ramped fantastically in the second quarter. Jeff Dietert - Simmons: Thanks, guys. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And your next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Paul Cheng - Barclays: Hey, guys. Two questions, Joe, I joined a little bit late, maybe you already covered it. Do you have a preliminary CapEx outlook for 2015 and \u201816? Joe Gorder : Yeah. No, Paul, we don\u2019t and I\u2019ll tell what, what we are doing right now is we are going through the strategic planning process here at Valero and part of that, obviously, is the review of any kind of growth project we might be looking forward to in the 2015, in addition to what we got base loaded. We are spending $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion a year on maintenance reliability turnaround. So, that is going to continue and be fundamentally part of what we\u2019re doing. But we haven\u2019t settled in on the projects, the growth projects we want to carry forward those and we continue to pursue the crude units, we continue to look at the methanol plant. And then as you would expect there is host of logistic projects that we are evaluating. But we haven\u2019t settled in on the number, yet. Paul Cheng - Barclays: Do you have settled into a direction at least this year is three, are we talking about -- from a direction standpoint flat, up or down? Joe Gorder : Yeah. Paul, it won\u2019t be up. Paul Cheng - Barclays: Okay. The second question that, do you have an estimated downtime cost in the second quarter in terms of the actual incremental cost and also that if you can give it, if you have it, would be helpful that for two number, one is the actual incremental cost and the second one is the opportunity cost that you lost? Lane Riggs : Hi Paul. This is Lane. So our unscheduled downtime cost in the second quarter was $103 million. Paul Cheng - Barclays: $103 million. And that\u2019s pretax or after-tax earning? Lane Riggs : That\u2019s really EBITDA. Paul Cheng - Barclays: And you say, that\u2019s opportunity cost or it\u2019s actual cost? I\u2019m sorry. Lane Riggs : That is what we would call our volume variance which is if the units would\u2019ve performed the way we had planned than they would have generated another $103 million. Paul Cheng - Barclays: Right. So that\u2019s the opportunity cost? Lane Riggs : Yes. Paul Cheng - Barclays: And how about actual incremental cost. Because I presume that you probably have some because of all the downtime, you have some additional maintenance cost and all that\u2026 Lane Riggs : Yeah. I\u2019m not -- it\u2019s really that's embedded inside our performance. We\u2019d have to get back with you on that exact number. Paul Cheng - Barclays: Okay. Will do. Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : Hi. Good morning everybody. Joe Gorder : Good morning Paul. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : Guys, your throughputs in the quarter beat your guidance in every region. And you've effectively raised your guidance for 3Q to be more in-line with the better performance in Q2. Could you talk a little bit more about the dynamics of how you're coming in so much higher? Really, within weeks and months of having set the guidance, you're coming in about 10% plus higher, in terms of throughputs. Could you just talk a bit more about, firstly, the technicalities of that? Secondly, the implications? And thirdly, where we might go, given the CapEx you've highlighted this year for presenting yet more light sweet? Thanks. Ashley Smith : Okay. So Paul, this is Ashley. On actual runs, throughput runs versus guidance, guidance is -- it\u2019s a conservative estimate based on planned downtime and turn around, things like that. And I think what you can do is run some -- get some throughput. It might be lower margin throughput because you\u2019re buying higher-price intermediates or other feedstocks to keep downstream units going. Generally that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see delta. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : So, it's not a function of you running more light sweet and, therefore, pushing more crude through the refineries? Ashley Smith : No. I think we generally planned to run the amount of lights that we expected. It more has to do with planned downtime. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : Okay. So actually, what you're pretty clearly saying is, the better performance is simply due to a conservative guidance that you beat? Ashley Smith : Because of relatively heavy planned turnaround activity. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : Right. The final part of my question was, does your current CapEx program expand the capacity or is it a shift mix entirely? Joe Gorder : Paul, we\u2019ll let Lane talk about the crude units and what the impact will be. Lane Riggs : Yeah. So Paul, this is Lane Riggs. So again we have our two announced crude units, one at Corpus Christi and one at Houston with the combined capacity of incremental suite capability of about around 160,000 barrels a day. And then we\u2019ll finish McKee which is an incremental 25 a day next year. Those are really the planned expansion on light sweet product capability. So with that said, we still are learning limits of our system on how much light sweet crude we can run, particularly on a Gulf Coast where it\u2019s available. And we\u2019re not really -- we still optimize those crude into our system versus our alternative medium sour, heavy sour, Canadian heavy and all these other. So we still have -- we can feel optimize and run more if the economics signals are there. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : The final part of this whole question is for me to ask you, in the past, you said that you need a 10% light heavy differential to run a (indiscernible) I think, was the guidance. Do you have a sense the -- you talked about the sensitivities. Can you give us a sense for what the price differentials need to be to be running, more or less? Yeah, on lights, on lights? Lane Riggs : So you are saying -- Paul, this is Lane. So you are saying that we\u2019ve given guidance in the past that we need a light heavy differential of 10% versus\u2026. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : Yes. Kind of a rule of thumb for what causes you to run more light sweet in a mix against, for example, a medium sour. Joe Gorder : To back out heavy and run. Lane Riggs : Yeah, back out heavy and run sweet. It\u2019s probably fair somewhere in that number. Today we definitely have incentive to run all three et cetera. And they all have slightly a pretty similar margins into our crude capacity and/or into an open (indiscernible). So I think today, if you would look at, they are very reflective of what these -- what the relative values in refineries are. Joe Gorder : 13% off of rig. Right, so it\u2019s in that general range. It still would trickle to run the heavy solid crudes versus pushing more light sweet into the plant. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research : Okay, guys. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company: Good morning. I'll just touch on the condensate export issue. It seems like it's come into flux a little bit over the past couple days. I was wondering, as we await the BIS public guidance, as far as what the requirements will be in processing, if you have identified any opportunities at Corpus Christi, maybe either on the midstream side or sourced at the VLO level for that kind of processing capacity? Where you can kind of lean into some regulatory shifts that might nominally work against you but with VLP, could actually become the revenue margin driver over time? Joe Gorder : Well, Sam, we look at these projects all the time. Right now, we don\u2019t have a condensate splitter project on the board. We\u2019re very focused on the two crude units that we talked about and really nothing beyond that at this point in time. Lane Riggs : So Sam, this is Lane. I\u2019ll follow-up a little bit. The two crude units that we have designed, have a designed API gravity of 50. So these two crude units are fairly long although we would say the equipment is necessary to run a pretty light diet. We could run condensate and this is going to be a matter of again, what the economic signals and how distressed it is. In our economics, we had LLS and Brent parity. And we had to export naphtha out of U.S. Gulf Coast close to Far East. So that stream whether it\u2019s condensate, it\u2019s naphtha, whatever form it takes, it\u2019s got to find the market whether it\u2019s western Europe or the Far East, that sort of -- the value of naphtha is in the value of these condensates. It\u2019s still -- it will be interesting to see how that goes. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company: Okay. Even if they are taking up to 50, they'll still produce some BGO for the hydrocrackers and some of the other downstream units too? Lane Riggs : Yes, it\u2019s not as much, right, because it\u2019s lighter. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company: Okay. Lane Riggs : And that will be included in our economic because our alternative would be the intermediate to fill out of conversion units. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company: Okay, thanks. And I just wanted to touch on differentials in the Gulf, too. There has been a lot of volatility. I think last year when LLS spiked to that Brent premium briefly in July and August, you guys had highlighted the fact that some barrels were coming in on Longhorn offspec and the spot market for LLS and in Houston got very tight because of that. Is there any single piece of infrastructure development that we can be mindful of here over the last couple of weeks, aside from just very high utilization in the Gulf, maybe the delay in BridgeTex or something of that nature that might explain that LLS pop a couple of weeks ago? Joe Gorder : Sam, this is Joe. Randy Hawkins is with us reporting and Randy is our Senior Vice President of Crude and Feedstocks Supply and he will be able to answer that for you. Randy Hawkins : I think you touched on it already -- the high utilization rate that kind of led to some of the spike that we saw in LLS at the end of the August trade month. But I think you hit on the nose. The thing that we are looking ahead is the BridgeTex startup that we are anticipating at sometime late Q3 that will bring some of this distressed midland type barrels to the Gulf Coast that should help to provide some of the barrels that the Gulf Coast needs. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company: Okay, great. I think it's delayed, right? Is there some planned barrels or something that people are missing, and sort of a spot market issue, maybe? Joe Gorder : Yeah, I mean, I think there were some -- maybe some people that were anticipating BridgeTex being a bit earlier and I think overall the high run rate, people were just a bit short and falling inventories as well led to that. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company: All right. Thank you so much. Operator : And the next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Guys good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had two for you. One bigger picture and one more specific. But the big picture, Joe, as you kind of transition into your new role, I'm just curious if there is any low-hanging fruit or any strategic shifts that you see on the radar screen that you really want to address out of the gate? Joe Gorder : Blake, good morning. I mean that\u2019s a fair question but quite honestly I think that this management team that\u2019s in the room today has been working with Bill for a long time and the plans that we put in place are plans that we are all very comfortable with. And so if you look at what we have got on the burner with the crude units and the logistics investment and then you look at some of the projects that are being contemplated like the methanol plan. These are all projects. This team feels pretty good about and that we are continuing to advance the conversations around. So from an investment perspective there isn\u2019t. From a use of cash perspective, we have maintained for sometime now that we are going to try to maintain a balanced program between investment and capital projects for growth and return of cash to shareholders. And I think we are going to continue to do that. I mean very clearly the fact now that we have had our second dividend increase this year which support the fact that we are permitted to increasing the cash returns to shareholders. And then today we bought back about 10.4 million shares and we will continue to do that throughout the year as cash flow is available to do it. So I would say there is no major shifts right now. The ox cart is not in the ditch. And as I mentioned earlier we are going through the process of pulling together our strategic plan for the next several years including and that will be capital plan. So I think we are in a pretty good position. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : All right. That\u2019s great. The second question, I hope this is one question, but you runs up at Quebec of North America crude hit at 83%. I was hoping if you can give us a breakdown of how much of that has been barge from Gulf Coast and how much is actually tied I guess from Canada? And then I guess similarly on the rail to St Charles, just trying to understand should we be thinking about the economics on that as far as once you pay for transport. Is that kind of competitive with Maya or even more competitive just kind of some general feel about how we should be thinking about the margin impact there? Thanks. Randy Hawkins : Blake, this is Randy Hawkins again. At Quebec the split of our North American crude was around 58 days by rail and about 1 00 a day shifts from the US Gulf Coast and two Quebec. Could you repeat the question on the Canadian? Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Yes. Basically it looks like you started railing bitumen into St. Charles and I guess that is kind of view that as competing maybe with Maya and I didn\u2019t know by the time you pay for transport to rail it down from Canada if we should be viewing that as if more competitive. In other words, discounted to which you could access Maya at or at par? Randy Hawkins : Yes, I would say that we\u2019re railing from Canada would be on par or better than Maya. The volumes for Q2 are fairly small. We anticipate this increase as we move into Q3. Joe Gorder : Yes, Blake the refinery was moving turn around in the internally around in second quarter, so we aren\u2019t going to see the impact of any of those that bitumen movement until the third quarter. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : And the next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Good morning, it\u2019s Faisel from Citi. Just had a question to follow-up on Blake's question on Canadian heavy. So I guess with the rail capacity at St. Charles and even some of your other facilities, and then with the connection to Keystone from Port Arthur, how much Canadian heavy do you guys envision having the ability to access by the end of the year? And then how are you thinking of that, versus your term contracts with PEMEX. Is there flexibility? Just sort of arbitrage those barrels between each other? Randy Hawkins : Sure. Faisel, this is Randy Hawkins again. On our Canadian volume, we do anticipate with our rail facility in Lucas coming up later in the year that we will increase the amount of rail that we are taking into our production facility. We also buy regularly Canadian heavy after the pipeline systems coming out of cushion as well. So right now we don\u2019t anticipate that impacting our volumes with Mexico and it more is backing out some of the spot heavy that we are doing elsewhere from around the region. Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And just how much sort of capacity for Canadian heavy do you think you guys will have the ability to sort of run by the end of the period what always pipelihe and real capacity? Joe Gorder : I think for now we are limited logistics more so than we find the configuration . Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, fair enough. And just my question it\u2019s on the changes in the rail regulations, have you see from the DoT and also the Canadian regulators. Is that going to have any impact of sort of the volumes you guys are moving around your system by rail? Joe Gorder : Faisel, I think we are all waiting to see what those regulations settling in at and if you look at the things that are being proposed with the shell thickness in the (indiscernible) protection systems, the breaking systems. There is going to be a lot of retrofitting activity and modifications to already planned cars that has to take place and frankly the fleet, the rail fleet is in service today, it\u2019s very large and depending on the timeline for retrofit, it\u2019s going to have an affect on rail movement just in general. So we don\u2019t have a good estimate as to what the overall impact is going to be. We are in the process of working this year or so specifically working with ASP and formulating response to DOT and to transport Canada\u2019s proposal, but its probably just a little bit early for us to give you any idea as to what the impact might be. Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. Understood. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Jason Smith - Bank of America : Hey, guys. It's actually Jason Smith, on for Doug. If we could touch on throughput from the product side. With you guys and industry seemingly running at a higher overall level and in the release, I think you highlighted product prices versus Brent. Can you talk about what the implications of a self-sufficient U.S. system are, particularly on gasoline, where I think we're exporting as much as we're importing, at this point? Joe Gorder : All right. So we\u2019re kind of looking at each other, trying to figure out exactly what it is you that you\u2019re trying to understand. Are you saying, at what utilization rates do we satisfy U.S. demand? Jason Smith - Bank of America : No. I'm trying to say, I mean, we've basically seen, we've talked about product prices, pricing off Brent. But is there -- as we become more self-sufficient on the gasoline side, is there risk? Do we potentially price off of LLS? Joe Gorder : I see. Jason Smith - Bank of America : How do you see that playing out? We're producing 9.5 million a day of gasoline today. We're exporting as much as we're importing. Joe Gorder : Right. That\u2019s an interesting question. Why don\u2019t we let -- Scott Lively is with us today and he is our Senior Vice President of Products, Supply and Trading. Maybe he can just give you some thoughts on that. Scott Lively : Hey Doug, how are you doing? Jason Smith - Bank of America : Good. Scott Lively : I guess, the way that I think about it, I don\u2019t think about necessarily what price products have to price off of as a feedstock. I just think, you\u2019ve got prices that are around the globe and we have to compete. And so barrels either arb into those markets or did not arb into those markets. And so you can say, we priced against Brent or we priced against something else. Well, we\u2019re running a lot more WTI based crudes in the Gulf Coast. So that region sees more of a WTI like margin whereas, something on the East Coast of New York refinery say, might price more against West African, Canadian that moves eastward. So I think you\u2019re going to see pockets, the differentiation based on what crude types people run. But I don\u2019t get it but I necessarily think about the way that you\u2019re trying to describe with pricing against brand specifically or WTI specifically. Joe Gorder : We do talk about the incremental barrel into a refiner being a light sweet water borne barrel, which should be kind of a Brent type barrel, as long as that\u2019s the incremental barrel, you\u2019re going to be pricing products off of Brent. Scott Lively : You have to get rid of all the gasoline production in those marginal refineries, which -- that\u2019s a lot of European and African and South American refineries. Those would have to be backed down, shut down before your price in the marginal barrel off of LLS or WTI and that significant amount, so those are the price pattern. Yes, you going to have times where U.S., low quality gasoline in the winter going to trade cheaper than it does in summer, you always have seasonality. But the marginal barrel is still going to be pricing out of the U.S. that\u2019s going to set the prices. Jason Smith - Bank of America : Got it. How is the shift to a lighter crude slate and how is that impacting your gasoline yield? Are you seeing more gasoline out of that crude, at this point? Lane Riggs : Hey, this is Lane. And now we\u2019re pretty much still running, making almost within the noise of our systems, the same amount of gasoline that we were. And because of flexibility in the system and how we can change in points, whether we made naphtha or gasoline or just a lot of optimization points that we still have. Jason Smith - Bank of America : Got it. My follow-up is on the West Coast. One of your peers recently announced a petrochem feedstock project. Are there any opportunities for projects like that within your portfolio? And also, if you could, maybe, give us an update on the Benicia rail project and where that stands right now? Lane Riggs : Okay. This is Lane again, all start with the Benicia rail project. It\u2019s currently in the -- DEIR is out during the comment period, we close on that. The comment period will close September 15. We\u2019re still confident that we will get a permit, of course we\u2019ll hope -- we'll, certainly along the city of Benicia will help to help answer all the question that come out of DEIR. On the first point, we are looking at a lot of projects to the ones that you\u2019re talking about. And I think we\u2019re fairly skeptical. It would be tough to get permits. I think at the end of day, we take a while to build the project and get permit push through with quite an effort, as you can see with the crude-by-rail project on the West Coast. Jason Smith - Bank of America : Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Operator : And then next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Roger Read - Wells Fargo : Hello, Good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read - Wells Fargo : Well, I guess, I wanted to ask a little bit about the export market, what you see for volumes as we head into the fourth quarter. Traditionally, the strongest part of the year. And if you could give us a recap of what you've seen in the diesel market year-to-date. If we looked at where the futures were a year ago versus what we realized, margins came in a lot lower and I'm just speaking from a general or generic term. Can you kind of walk us through what you are seeing out there in the diesel market, both domestically and on the export side? And whether or not that has any particular concerns, as we look to the end of the year? Scott Lively : Hi, Roger. This is Scott again. Over the quarter, we exported 210 a day of diesel and I would say, that\u2019s pretty flat with where we were on 1Q. We still see continued global demand growth in that fuel. So we feel pretty positive about our ability to export number one and having those markets to export into number two. You did have a little bit of hangover effect of the mild winter that Europe had, which really, particularly kept German stocks from drawing down. But those stocks are coming back more in line and those guys look like they are going to need to be building going into the winter. So we fully expected these export rates that we\u2019ve had to continue out in the 3Q and 4Q. Roger Read - Wells Fargo : Okay. And then, something that got beat up on last year. We keep waiting for the EPA to give us the official numbers. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in the RINs market? We all know where the prices are. But what you've been doing about buying RINs, what your plans are if they make changes, presumably, an upwards revision to the ethanol and other biofuel requirements, as has been rumored in the press. As we, maybe, get something next month. Certainly hope to see something by the October, November period? Scott Lively : Well, we do of course, keep our eye on the markets and we are participants. I think it probably put me at a competitive disadvantage if I said exactly what we were doing and what I planned on doing if we got an idea that they were actually going to raise too or above the blend wall as Podesta and potentially, Gina MacCarthy have alluded to. I think we just have to sit back just like everyone else and wait for them to come out with the final decision on what the obligation is gong to be. And hopefully at sooner rather than later because obviously as the time horizon shrinks that shrinks the time horizon for you to be able to go out there and procure the RINs that you\u2019re obligated to in arrears. Joe Gorder : Yeah. I think the one thing that we do have going right now though is that there is probably as much ethanol being blended into the gasoline fuel. This could possibly be blended and as a result supply of RIN is there. So the economics are supporting it and the ethanol market in general, this is favorable to blend. Roger Read - Wells Fargo : Right. Unfortunately, it's not always an economic driven story, where RINs are concerned and ethanol. I guess, one final question, just as a follow-up on that. Have we heard anything about 2015 volumes or adjustments or any of that or is the expectation that, that may come out with the revised \u201814 numbers? Joe Gorder : I think that\u2019s what their expectation is, is that it comes out it would be interesting to have \u201814s and \u201815s come out. Well, it would be interesting to have \u201815 come out in \u201914. I wouldn\u2019t think that there hasn\u2019t been our past practice, but I don\u2019t think there is anything that we\u2019ve heard to a great that\u2019s given us any indication of what \u201915 might be. Roger Read - Wells Fargo : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse : Yeah, good morning everyone. Just on I guess a bigger picture, strategic question, $1.5 billion of growth CapEx, of which around 50% going into logistics. You've got VLP out there, $2.6 billion. So it's a relatively small MLP, but Valero's market cap has got a currency of its own. And obviously, you can drop down assets into VLP over time. Just get a sense of the color of how big you see the organic suite of opportunities in logistics. And then maybe even, any comments on using your equity to be more assertive, perhaps, in the inorganic M&A space? Mike Ciskowski : Okay. Well, I think, we stated before that we Valero Energy have about $800 million of EBITDA that could be dropped to VLP. So, it\u2019s a very significant number. We completed the first drop here at the beginning of the third quarter on July 1, I think it was -- and that was about $154 million transaction. And I think it\u2019s fair to expect that we are working the subsequent drop transaction as we go forward. I think we recognized very clearly the value of interrelationships of the two entities and the multiple pickup we get when we drop Valero Energy down to VLP. We have a lot of projects as you mentioned that are in our current growth capital that we are working on which will be assets that would add to the base of assets that can be dropped. So really the question is that we are working through is the pace and the timing on those. And we said we are going to grow VLPs distribution to 20-plus percent a year. We still are intending to do that. And so our drop schedule at a minimum would be able to accommodate that growth rate. Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse : It just seems like there's a large opportunity for companies in your space who have the skills to be very large and successful infrastructure companies, against the shell revolution to continue to shift assertively into that direction, given the relative multiples. So appreciate you might be going through the planning process now. But any thoughts about the direction you want to take the company? Joe Gorder : Yeah, I think we\u2019re looking at host of different logistics project that are in development and will allow us to take advantage of what you've described. There\u2019s great opportunity with the shale plays. But I don\u2019t have anything specifically share with you right now Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse : Okay. Then, maybe a question for runs, just on crude. Obviously, LLS spiked last year, and then LLS collapsed in the fourth quarter. The spike is, let's hope its history. And let's focus on the future, where we could see, perhaps, a repeat of what we saw the fourth quarter. A couple of things seemed to happen last year. Obviously, we built gasoline for a hurricane that didn't happen. There were lots of imports during the period. There was a rapid rise in inventories, seasonally. And you folks and others in the industry were trying to reduced inventories for the usual year-end planning purposes. So I'm just, sort of, the question. You mentioned BridgeTex earlier. But is there anything different that you see happening this year or do think this is sort of a new seasonality that's going to set in for the Gulf Coast crude prices? Joe Gorder : Yeah, thanks for that. I think the biggest difference that I see, is that crude runs are so much higher than what they\u2019ve been as of late which we go through some regional turnarounds that we head into Q3 or so. My thoughts is that this thing will get back to normal. As we\u2019re seeing September contract trade today and we\u2019ve seen LLS back down $2 to $3 under Brent and last year $7 under Brent. So things are starting to look normalize. Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse : Yes. And then, maybe, one tiny follow-on. Obviously, in winter, there's a difficulty pushing gasoline into the U.S. market and so you try and export the product into other markets. How are we, in terms of the ability for you to say, maintenance aside, run at a higher utilization than you would have done in the past? Because of the ability to export more product and out-compete other refineries around the world? Any color, there? Scott Lively : This is Scott again. As you know that those gasoline exports are seasonal. So we do export less in 2Q and tend to export more in 3Q and 4Q especially we have more availability in butane works itself back into the pool. I think that we\u2019re going to cost advantaged. And we do see plenty of opportunities with growth and market in Central, South and Central America, South America and in Mexico we still see put in opportunity to put barrels out in those regions. So we still pretty good about our positions to export and keep refinery rates high in our system as result of those exports. Joe Gorder : We are up on it. One last thing I\u2019ll add was Scott has said to your point, U.S. Gulf Coast capacity is most competitive capacity in the world. So if there we can save any market, we have low natural gas front. We are (indiscernible) and we\u2019re well positioned to maintain our assets. High utilization is we can find. We\u2019re not really up against any export logistic per se. So we don\u2019t really see being (indiscernible). Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse : Thank you Operator :  And the next question comes form Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley : Hi. Good morning, guys. Maybe a more specific follow-up on next question. I know you are not providing 2015 CapEx guidance at this point. It was asked and answered yet. Given you had the MLP and given midstream spending as a increase percentage of CapEx, how do MLP dropdown relate to your consideration of CapEx, and it would appear to me that they are direct offset and distributable -- potential distributable cash flows and I have follow-up? Thanks. Joe Gorder : Well, I mean, that\u2019s a million dollar question right there. In the subsequent question that is, at what point in time do we start doing this logistics projects in VLP itself and not at Valero Energy for dropdown? We have a lot of good projects that we are looking and what we are trying to understand is whole notion around, if you would look at gross capital or net capital number to be quite honestly, yes. We have a very good feel for I believe what we are going to be spending on refining side of the business that the wildcard here is, how much do we spend on the logistics side. So, I know you love to have a number and there will be a point when we give it you but I am just not prepared to share today. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley : What would, let me ask you a question when you are evaluating midstream projects and what ultimately goes into the EBITDA that you characterize as MLP EBITDA. I mean, do you consider the relative cap rate versus the MLP drop rate in the overall calculation of the IRR. For instance the rate different and more color there, I think, would help us, I am just curious that\u2019s an element of your evaluation of what to proceed on? Joe Gorder : Yeah. I believe it is. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley : Maybe lastly, then, for me, any update on the timing, we're keeping a midstream focus here, but any update on the timing of potential methanol facility decision and given Westlake Chemical Partners MLP IPO that uses a fixed-rate structure versus variable and is, I think it's up 25% this morning, well through the range? How does a structure like that factor into that project consideration, which I know is under review and I'll leave it at that? Thanks. Joe Gorder : Okay. Well, honestly, you know, we mentioned earlier that we continue to take a look at the project and we are advancing engineering. Lane and his team are trying to get our arms around exactly, what the scope of the project is. And again, yet, to look at the transaction you mentioned to know the impact of it, so we will take a look and then perhaps we can look back with you and have actually involve and John. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley : Okay. John Locke : Specific we are in Phase II. We are doing all those sort of engineering to major equipment so we can nail down the cost estimate. How that we view in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re in the process. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Okay. And that's the process prior to -- it's going to reach an FID. Is that accurate? Joe Gorder : It\u2019s the process, I\u2019m sorry, can you say that again? Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley : I'm sorry. Is that the step -- after that phase is complete, is that when you then decide whether or not to go to a final investment decision? Joe Gorder : That phase we\u2019ll make a decision whether we feel so good about that we\u2019ll go ahead and order all the equipment, which would expedite the project. That\u2019s really the critical decision that we\u2019ve taken. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley : Great. All right, guys. Appreciate the information. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Allen Good from Morningstar. Allen Good - Morningstar: Good morning, everyone. I want to try to come back to the export question and, maybe, get your longer-term outlook. There seems to be a lot of changes underfoot there, with a lot of the refining capacity additions in Asia and the Middle East, potential improvement in European competitiveness given exports of, maybe, heavy crude over there, maybe even light crude. I think you have a bunch of peers increasing exports as well. So could you just talk about your long-term outlook there and how you think the export market for U.S. refineries and Valero, particularly, will develop? Scott Lively : Allen, this is Scott again. I think that we were a bit ahead of the curve versus Europe of course on running those price advantaged crudes. So depending upon how long that takes to work its way and you can still see more closures in Europe. And clearly, Europe\u2019s kind of at a pinchpoint between the United States -- and mostly U.S. and Russia. Like I said before, I steel feel pretty good about our ability to export into these markets. A lot was made about Jubail coming on line. So far, you can see a sprinkling of cargos go here and there. But so far, what we\u2019ve seen is those cargos from Jubail have mostly gone into internal demand and stayed on the east coast of Africa. So sure, going forward, there is more refineries, they are going to come online and by way of China, there is going to be more capacity in U.S. but you should see that tempered with refinery closure especially those ones that are marginal. And as we said before, we still see the prospect of world demand growth for diesel. Allen Good - Morningstar: Okay. Switching to the condensate export question, just looking at your recent investment presentation. And you have some notes in there saying that at the end of the day, less condensates in the crude stream could ultimately be beneficial for Valero, given some of the utilization rates and yields. Have you been able to quantify, exactly, what the loss on utilization or yields may have been over the past couple of years, as those crude streams did get lighter with additional condensates? Lane Riggs : This is Lane. I don\u2019t know -- I'm not sure, I can give you exactly the loss. It hasn\u2019t been large but what we do, we\u2019re very careful in terms of how we articulate the quality of those suppliers. We have deducts and we can\u2019t give you numbers but we have standard deductions with API gravity goes up. We try to offset any sort of financial penalties we might have. But as refiners, we personally would like to see the condensate out of the blended crude. We\u2019re not but that\u2019s going to take a considerable infrastructure buildout to try to get condensate in whatever locations pushed to back in half. And so we\u2019re not necessarily opposed to condensate being segregated to other crude strengths. But today, we don\u2019t have. We haven\u2019t had any real major constraints based on these gravities that we certainly have. The way we purchase our crude, we certainly attempt to offset it. Allen Good - Morningstar: And just a follow-up from the earlier comment regarding that, you\u2019re not interested in making any of those investments that would be separated too? Joe Gorder : Well, again, our two crude units had a capacity there we provide them for 50 API. We can certainly run them at slightly reduced capacity. We can run even more. I think, the way we best -- the way we do things, we\u2019ll compare condensate and versus our alternative crude economic and that will determine how much we\u2019re going to run. I think what I was trying to talk earlier was I think, the industry and everybody making it stream, its going to have to try the market. That was the like condensate, whether it\u2019s slightly altered condensate, process condensate, new condensate, I\u2019m not sure. That\u2019s I have to plan at own somewhere. Our assessment was it\u2019s going to be the Far East. But we will certainly our best relationship with condensate and crude oil is this becomes more available. Allen Good - Morningstar: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Faisel Kahn from Citigroup. Faisel Kahn - Citigroup: Yeah. Hi, guys. Just a couple of small questions. First one, with the Cushing inventory, sort of, reaching bottom, is there any impact to McKee and Ardmore for you guys or do you have sort of enough inventory within the refining gate to, basically, not be impacted by lower inventories at Cushing? Randy Hawkins : Faisal, this is Randy again. The key specifically it\u2019s mostly a Midland market which is with crude oil at the moment. And similarly, Ardmore also takes some barrel out of that market as well. So we\u2019ve really not seen any impact on supply of the source barrels. Faisel Kahn - Citigroup: Is it fair to say that, because of where production is, that you just don't need the inventory levels? Because you've got enough growth in production to offset sort of the balancing impact of having storage in place in previous years? Randy Hawkins : Yeah. I think definitely to market goals are backward aided so there is no incentive for people to hold barrel there. Faisel Kahn - Citigroup: Okay. Fair enough. Last question on -- actually two more questions. On the Corpus Christi dock, could that dock be used for condensate exports? Have you guys looked at that? Lane Riggs : Yes. This is Riggs. We looked at that and they could be use for condensate. Faisel Kahn - Citigroup: Okay. Fair enough. The last question is on getting barrels into Louisiana from Houston. Are you guys having any issues, or are you pretty much able to get as much crude from the western side of Houston into Louisiana? Any sort of constraints that you guys are seeing? Randy Hawkins : No. This is Randy get in. No real constraint. I mean, it moving to your pipe on that Ho-Ho and barging and shipped in through Louisville. All that does satisfy and the rail is continuing to come down as well from the Bakken. So (Indiscernible) is well supplied. Faisel Kahn - Citigroup: Great. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate the time. Randy Hawkins : Sure. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Faisel. Thanks, Sylvia. I think with that we appreciate everyone calling in and those listening to our call today. If you have additional questions, please contact our IR department. Thank you. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Daniel, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke. Mr. Locke, you may begin. John Locke : Thank you, Daniel. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our CEO and President; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Now, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC. Now, before we review the quarterly results, I\u2019d like to highlight some of our strategic accomplishments in the last quarter. These actions aligned with our key strategies to reduce feed stock costs by improving access to North American crudes and to grow our logistic investments and Valero Energy Partners LP, our sponsored logistics partnership. In August, we secured shipping rights and the option to purchase a 50% interest in Plain All American Diamond Pipeline. When completed in late 2016, that 440-mile pipeline will connect our Memphis refinery to the crude oil hub at Cushing Oklahoma. Regarding Valero Energy Partners LP, we completed our first drop for $154 million in cash at the beginning of the third quarter. We also continue to advance in our capability to access and process advantage crudes during the quarter, with the commissioning of our rail unloading facility at the Port Arthur refinery. With the startup in September, this is the third crude-by-rail facility we\u2019ve completed in the past 13 months, with the other two completed facilities located at our St. Charles and Quebec City refineries. As mentioned in the release, we are also progressing on our other key investments as part of our strategy, including the completion of investments to receive advantage crude at our Quebec refinery on Enbridge 9B Pipeline reversal. We also expect to complete the hydrocracker revamp at our Meraux refinery later this quarter. Now, looking out a little further, the two crude topping units at our Corpus Christi and Houston refineries are progressing as planned. Moving on to our quarterly results, as you saw in our earnings release we had a strong quarter. We reported third quarter 2014 earnings of $1.1 billion or $2 per share. Third quarter 2014 operating income was $1.7 billion or $1.1 billion higher than the third quarter of 2013. Most of the increase within the refining segment although the ethanol business also contributed. Refining throughput margin in the third quarter of 2014 was $11.81 per barrel, an increase of $4.05 per barrel versus the third quarter of 2013. Wider discounts on sweet and sour crude oils versus brand and strong gasoline margins in most regions were slightly offset by weaker distillate margins versus brands in most regions and higher natural gas costs. Also contributing to the higher throughput margin, although Quebec City refinery\u2019s higher year-over-year consumption of North American light crude in the third quarter. The refinery\u2019s feedstock diet consisted of 79% North American grades in the third quarter of 2014, which is up from 6% in the third quarter of 2013. In addition, we realized a reduction in crude cost in our Mid-Continent region when we completed our connections with pipeline in Childress Texas. This connection allowed us to receive an incremental 40,000 to 50,000 barrels per day at Midland price WTI crude oil primarily for our McKee refinery. Lastly, we continue to ramp up North American crude consumption in our Gulf Coast region by replacing an additional 100,000 barrels per day of foreign crude in the third quarter of 2014 versus the third quarter of 2013, with some of those volumes delivered to Port Arthur by our new rail unloading facility I mentioned earlier. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 42,000 barrels per day versus the third quarter of 2013. Less turnaround activity and higher throughput capacity utilization led to the increase in volumes which was supported by strong product exports and the increased availability of North American light crude on the Gulf Coast. We operated our refineries at 98% throughput capacity utilization for the quarter. In our refining, cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2014 were $3.81 per barrel, which is $0.07 per barrel higher than third quarter of 2013 due mainly to higher energy costs. The ethanol segment generated record earnings of $198 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2014 versus $113 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2013. The increase in ethanol segment operating income was mainly due to $0.27 per gallon increase in gross margin driven by lower corn prices on an abundant corn harvest, higher production volumes from the startup of our Mount Vernon, Indiana plant. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.6 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2014. General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $180 million in the third quarter of 2014. Net interest expense was $98 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $430 million. The effective tax rate was 32.9%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $6.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.2 billion of which $231 million was held by Valero Energy Partners LP. Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 10.5% excluding cash held by Valero Energy Partners LP. Valero had approximately $5.6 billion and Valero Energy Partners had $300 million of available liquidity in addition to cash. Cash flows in the third quarter included $622 million of capital expenditures of which $123 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. In the third quarter we raised our dividend for the second time this year with 10% increase. We returned $489 million in cash to our stockholders, which included $145 million in dividend payments and $344 million in purchases of approximately 7 million shares of Valero common stock. And subsequent to the third quarter, we continue to return cash to stockholders by purchasing an additional 3 million share of common stock for $138 million, which brings our total for 2014 to 18.4 million shares for $937 million. For 2014, we are lower in our guidance for capital expenditures including turnarounds and catalysts by $100 million to approximately $2.9 billion. We expect stay-in business capital to account for slightly less than 50% of total spending with the remainder related to growth investments primarily for logistics and advantage crude oil processing capability. More than 50% of Valero\u2019s estimated growth investments in 2014 are for logistics, and we believe most of this will be eligible for drop-down into Valero Energy Partners LP. Now, for 2015 capital expenditures including turnarounds and catalyst, we expect to spend approximately $2.8 billion consisting of approximately $1.8 billion for stay-in business capital and $1.3 billion for growth investments, a majority of growth investments are allocated to logistics and increase in our capability to process manage crude. So, for modeling, our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges, Gulf Coast at 1.55 million to 1.6 million barrels per day, Mid-Continent at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be around $4 per barrel. For our ethanol operations in the fourth quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.7 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.41 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expense excluding depreciation for the fourth quarter to be around $190 million and net interest expense should be about $95 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter should be approximately $425 million and our effective tax rate should be around 35%. So, now I will turn the call over to Joe for a few remarks. Joe Gorder : Well, thank you, John. And as you may have seen, last week announced that Bill Klesse has chosen to step-down as Chairman of Valero Energy\u2019s Board of Directors at the end of this year. So, on behalf of our Valero team, we just want to thank Bill for all he\u2019s done to make this company successful over his 45-year career. And we really like to wish Marty and Bill, all the best going forward. John? John Locke : Thank you, Joe. So, before I turn over to Q&A, I just want to clarify on the 2015 stay-in business capital should be $1.5 billion, I believe I said $1.8 billion. So, okay, Daniel, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we will open the call to questions. During this segment, we request that callers limit each turn to two questions. The callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions. Operator : Okay, thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our very first question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead. Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons: Yes. It\u2019s Jeff Dietert with Simmons. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons: So my question has to do with some of your crude feedstock costs and specifically one with Saudi having raised their prices to the U.S. It appears that some of their crudes were not terribly competitive. We saw the crude imports for the total U.S. drop from 1.6 million barrels a day in April to less than 900,000 barrels a day in September while Saudi was increasing prices during that period of time. Since then they\u2019ve had four consecutive months of price reductions. And I was wondering if you could provide some color as to how attractive the Saudi crudes have been in the market through the spring and summer? And whether or not these recent reductions in prices make them more competitive now? Gary Simmons : Hi Jeff, this is Gary Simmons. You\u2019re exactly right. I mean the Saudi barrels that gotten to wear, we felt like they were competitive versus all alternatives. In the third quarter our volumes from the total Middle East were down considerably where we\u2019ve historically run. We\u2019re now seeing this they\u2019re making pricing moves to bring their barrels back being competitive in the market. I would say with their recent announcement on their OSP they were competitive or at least within basic sense of marks. Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons: Okay. And secondly with the Brent pricing being weak and some of the West African prices being soft, have you seen those barrels price themselves back into either of the East Coast market or the Gulf Coast market with some of the softness relative to LLS, we\u2019ve seen this fall? Gary Simmons : Yes, Jeff. The place that we pivot first is really our Quebec refinery. And we definitely as Brent got weak, we saw some synergies start buying from West African grades again and backing out some of the grades that we were taking from U.S. Gulf Coast. Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons: Yes. So both that sounds like increases in imports in a market where we\u2019ve got pretty substantial domestic production growth. Do you think domestic prices have to soften to back those imports back out of the market? Gary Simmons : Yes. And you could kind of see that in the markets. The Brent got weak about three or four weeks ago. We started to pivot as others did. And then we\u2019ve had three straight weeks where crude goes towards in the U.S. bill. So it kind of tells you the differential has to come back off to force those barrels back into the market. Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons: Thanks for your comments. Operator : Our following question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Hi guys. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: I have one request and two questions. The request is that it seems that some of the part in losses may turn out to be an emerging investment team in the sector. I know there\u2019s still a small number, but it would be helpful I think for your shareholders if in your press release somewhere that you put down what is the GP cash flow and your total number of units in the LP and also that the total LP unit. I mean even though that those numbers can be found in your VLP disclosure it\u2019s just helpful there to be in one document. In terms of the question, with the announcement or that from one of your competitors last week in terms of their strategy in drop-down they have substantially as their rate, is there any key or more transparent strategy or data that you can put one in terms of your VLP drop-down pace or the distribution growth for the next several years? Joe Gorder : Yes, Paul that\u2019s a fair question. This is Joe. If we look at VLP, since the IPO we\u2019ve stated that we\u2019re going to grow our distributions between 20% and 25% a year. We\u2019re in target to be in the middle to the high-end to that range. We just completed a drop and a distribution increase and we\u2019re working on the next drop. Now, VLP is less than a year old, well we don\u2019t have a debt rating yet, we\u2019ll be in the process of getting that the next year or so. And it\u2019s our intention to be investment grade. Now, when you consider the size and the pace of our drops to VLP, our original plan was to start with the logistics assets that would be more traditional. And that\u2019s when we said that we\u2019ve got the $800 million of EBITDA that is not a specific business unit that we have within Valero, it\u2019s assets that are used to support the rest of the operations. And so we haven\u2019t had P&Ls for them. That being said, that we can go in and we can calculate what the EBITDA would be for those assets based on market rates and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Now, what\u2019s come up here recently is this additional set of cases that would include do you put fuel margins and process units, into the MLP. So, we\u2019re going to take a look at everything and we\u2019re going to act accordingly. Obviously it\u2019s never simple of taking EBITDA, putting the multiple on it and the same that\u2019s what the value is. You got a lot of tax effects that need to be considered. The other thing then is, with the use of proceeds, could they be used, I mean, I expect we\u2019re going to use them to do growth projects or to return the cash to the shareholders depending on which option has the highest returns. One of the questions we ask ourselves is if we do accelerate the drop we\u2019re going to get some of the parts valuation increase in Valero because that\u2019s something that although we\u2019ve executed the MLP, we haven\u2019t seen it yet. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Yes. But at least based on what Tesoro and MPC reaction on the last several weeks that seems like that is started catching on as a new theme? Joe Gorder : Yes, we see it too Paul. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Yes. A second question on the $2.8 billion next year budget is that including anything in the methanol projects? And if it is indeed going to go for FID, should we assume it is just an add-on or that you\u2019re going to compensate and adjusting it so that you still could get the $2.8 billion? Lane Riggs : Hi Paul, Lane Riggs. That $150 million in the 2015 led to $2.8 billion, and I\u2019ll predict we\u2019re in the Phase 2 development of the project and we\u2019ll go \u2013 we\u2019ll have another review in for side view, we\u2019ll then go somewhere in the second quarter of \u201815. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: And Lane if you do go ahead should we assume you\u2019re still keep $2.8 billion or that this is incremental? In other words will you adjust your other projects so that you don\u2019t go beyond the $2.8 billion? Lane Riggs : It is in the $2.8 billion. Joe Gorder : Yes, Paul the $150 million \u2013 we have a $150 million as a place folder in that $2.8 million budget. If we didn\u2019t perceive with the methanol plant, we wouldn\u2019t spend that $150 million and we\u2019d be at $265 million. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Okay, got you. Thank you. Operator : Our following question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil : Guys, good morning. Thanks. Congratulations on the rollover in CapEx into \u201815. I guess this is kind of a combination of a higher level question from Paul and maybe a tie on from Jeff as well as with regard to the Saudi pricing. It looks like the lower \u2013 the logistics spending is decreasing like 45% of the total down to about 30% of the growth total. And I guess I\u2019m just wondering with the Saudi\u2019s changing their pricing and I guess I\u2019m just wondering is there a chance where some of the infrastructure in North American crude investments that have been made, do we get to a point where some of that isn\u2019t quite as necessary? Do you still have the flexibility to shift back and forth to foreign versus domestic runs in your system? Gary Simmons : Yes, Blake. I would tell you I think we\u2019ve been very selective on what we should invest capital around logistics. We still think it makes sense that as you talked about, we haven\u2019t done anything to lose our optionality that we can continue to import the foreign barrels and Saudi makes more sense around those barrels, we haven\u2019t lost any of our optionality to be able to do that. Joe Gorder : Yes, Blake, Gary makes a great point here. I mean, what we\u2019re dealing with the markets that are really volatile. And the opportunity today is the opportunity today and it will change tomorrow or the next day. Again, one thing that is certain is if you don\u2019t have the logistics in place to take advantage of the opportunity when it\u2019s there is gone. And so, we feel very good about the projects that we\u2019ve undertaken. I mean, the rate approved projects to move heavy sour crudes in are very good projects for us as are the unloading facilities that we\u2019ve got. Our commitment to pipelines I think are very solid for us going forward. And the fact that you\u2019ve got the pressure on the crude price right now affecting the start is willing us to move barrels back in. At the end of the day it\u2019s going to be good because we\u2019re going to see pressure on all of the barrels as they try to find all-mineral refinery going forward. So, we feel pretty good about what we\u2019ve done and what we\u2019ve got on the place to do going forward. Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil : Okay. Thanks. The second question is on exports. We\u2019ve seen record high utilization levels earlier this year and you mentioned product exports in your press release. For one, can you give us a capacity number of what your current capacity is? And is that kind of one of the main drivers that\u2019s been driving this higher utilization? Because when I look at my modeling it seems like the earnings in 2012 were very comparable with where we\u2019re going to land this year and basically that insinuates it\u2019s not really that much more incentive from an economic standpoint to run, so is it simply a function of additional export capacity? John Locke : Yes, what we did in the third quarter is we did 90,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports, that time early we went to Mexico and Latin America. We did 227,000 barrels of straight distillers and 240,000 barrels of diesel when you include the currency. The distilled and exports went to Latin America and Europe. We still have quite a bit of capacity left. On the gasoline side, we can probably give about 255,000 barrels a day, it\u2019s around 400,000 barrels a day this to the next quarter. So, we still have a lot of room to increase our exports. But for us, this is just an optimization that we do every day, Blake. And it\u2019s just the matter of where we can get the best net-net for the barrels. So, when you look today, the domestic diesel market is very strong. And so, some of our diesel exports have slowed down a bit as we send barrels to the best net-net market which today is some of the domestic markets. Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Our following question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America : Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone. Good morning Joe. Joe Gorder : Hello Doug. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America : And by the way, Joe congrats on your ascending to the Chairmanship as well. It\u2019s nice to see with all of the titles. Joe Gorder : Thank you. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America : My, you\u2019ve see what Tesoro has done here recently by talking about a full-service MLP. And obviously a lot of \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of different strategies seem to be going on within the space I guess Phillips is pursuing a similar kind of thing. I guess I\u2019m curious as to looking outside of the refining backyard, so to speak, how do you view your MLP vehicle strategically in terms of maybe moving beyond just what we would associate as a normal course of business in the refining? Joe Gorder : I\u2019ll tell you Doug. We do look at it as an entity that\u2019s there to support the core business operations of Valero Energy. I mean, we\u2019ve set it up with that in tens, we set it up as a traditional logistics MLP that was going to primarily focus on transportation and terminalling assets. Obviously the market\u2019s changing here a little bit, people are making decisions to quit, a lot of their party assets in some cases in support some of the margin, the fuels margin in the assets also. I mean, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll take a look at going forward. But our view of it is a very attractive low cost of capital way to support Valero\u2019s core business. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America : Okay. I appreciate. I\u2019m going to just I\u2019ll take some follow-up offline because there are multiple costs seeking down with one but. I guess my follow-up is really, could we get your latest thinking on the fuels market, generally the gasoline market in particular. You still have little bit refinery kind of more fold recycled then might found a buyer. And obviously there is a whole crude context has come down. So I\u2019m just kind of curious as to, what\u2019s your prognosis for the Atlantic Basin gasoline market and should we expect the kind of resilience in parts we\u2019ve seen in these last couple of years, of these known supply risk emerging on the margins? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. John Locke : Thanks Joe. Joe Gorder : Yes, I guess two separate questions, I don\u2019t know, Lane, do you want to address the root one first. John Locke : Go ahead on the gasoline. Gary Simmons : Yes. Overall, I think we see gasoline demand in the Atlantic Basin fairly flat. And so, a lot of the question on the Atlantic Basin is really going to be what happens in Western Europe, and do you have rationalization occur in Western Europe, and that would probably be the big driver on the overall supply-demand balances in the Atlantic Basin moving forward. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America : Would that assume, you don\u2019t have an acute exports on higher I\u2019m guessing? Gary Simmons : Yes. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America : Okay. And on the pipe of diesel, do you see, in part of the Gulf Coast markets, particularly? Joe Gorder : Hi Doug, look, I think that project is going to be a bit challenged. And I mean, if they\u2019re producing gasoline, it\u2019s going to have to go somewhere so we\u2019ll probably see at the market. But I would stack up the competitive position of our Gulf Coast refineries against any refinery like that. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America : Okay. All right, you don\u2019t have the sum. Thanks a lot Joe. I appreciate your time. Joe Gorder : Thanks. Operator : Our following question comes from Brad Heffer from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brad Heffer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Good morning, everyone. Joe Gorder : Good morning. Brad Heffer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : So, going back, sort of to an earlier question, has there been any change as to the demand that you guys are seeing in export markets currently? Joe Gorder : No, I would tell you from the third quarter to the fourth quarter what I would expect is that our exports will probably be up a little bit, most of that will be gasoline exports will increase into the fourth quarter, just to the exports probably fairly flat which is difficult for us. Gasoline, typically the exports are little stronger in the fourth quarter and the first quarter and follow-up when we hear the December driving season here in the U.S. Brad Heffer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay, got you. And then, you had a competitor last week talking about sort of a tight MIA market on the Gulf Coast. I was wondering if you guys have seen that and having difficulty to getting sort of the heavier crudes in the door? Joe Gorder : Our MIA volumes for the third quarter were right at our contract levels and up about 20,000 barrels a day what we had in the second quarter. Brad Heffer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our following question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Great. Thanks good morning gentlemen. A couple of questions, maybe one, if you could talk a little bit about capture rate across very strong capture rate we saw across the portfolio this quarter, and I realize the following crude prices probably increase the profitability at the bottom of the barrel. But outside of that, can you talk about maybe any other drivers of strong profitability and how sustainable maybe some of those might be on go-forward quarters? Ashley Smith : Hi Ryan, this is Ashley Smith. Yes, we performed well we had a limited turnaround activity in the quarter, so other quarters might not be as comparable when we had more turnaround activity. But a lot of the capture rate is partially due to our investments and hydrocrackers are running well. In fact, St. Charles hydrocracker is running in a \u2013 consistingly running in excessive capacity. In addition, you saw some typical market stuff that\u2019s not in the indicator such as DGO as well we achieved in the quarter and that paid us well too. Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. So, probably some outage in non-recurring things but maybe at least underlying there some recurring things from your past investments, I guess it\u2019s in there? Ashley Smith : That is \u2013 that\u2019s basically, you\u2019re always going to have some movement in items that are not in the indicator. But we also are seeing benefits from our previous investments particularly in the hydrocrackers. Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, thanks. And then maybe one more on and I apologize that this is, I missed it over the call. On crude flows from Corpus feeds in Canada, I know you guys have moved some crude that\u2019s gone around there to the East Coast of Canada refining system. I mean, how much have you been moving and then how do you expect that they would change in 2015? Joe Gorder : Yes, so we moved 124,000 barrels a day of Gulf Coast crude to Quebec, that didn\u2019t all move through Corpus. Our project at Corpus will be online and probably functional in quarter terms, for the first quarter. So, we\u2019ll start using our corporate assets in the first quarter. The volume we move was largely over third party logistics assets that we move to Quebec. Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. And if you just look at, I mean, when you look at the 2015 dynamics both on the line 9B, eventual startup and capacity. Is that a number that you think you can grow substantially in 2015 or are there some limits there? Joe Gorder : Well, when line 9 starts up, we will run less barrels from the U.S. Gulf Coast than what we ran in the third quarter and we\u2019ll supply more Quebec\u2019s flowing through line 9. Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. All right, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : Our following question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo : Hi, good morning. Joe Gorder : Hello Roger. Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo : Just to pick up a little bit more on sort of the CapEx for \u201815, and maybe for \u201816 with the crude topping projects in I guess Corpus and Houston. And then maybe what the decision timeframe is on that? And I\u2019m thinking also all right, crude softened up a little bit, and they see some slowdown eventually in U.S. production if that has any impact on your thinking? And then whether or not the recent developments on the crude exports side, the DOE or EIA\u2019s report on gasoline prices being driven by brand not by domestic prices is sort of shot across the bow for being in favor of exports \u2013 crude exports? Lane Riggs : Hi Roger, this is Lane. To answer your questions about crude units, there are crudes and they are under construction, we\u2019re building on them. We\u2019ll right now, we\u2019re forecasting will be complete, mechanically complete into next year for oil and roughly at the beginning of the first quarter of \u201816, somewhere in that timeframe. In terms of the project basis economics, we assume that LLS is parity of brand and that\u2019s not what we recorded for those are still good projects. They aggregate around 30% in that pricing environment. So we still feel it\u2019s a really good project. Ultimately not backing out our intermediate purchases, we\u2019re beginning, we\u2019re long converging capacity, sort of the day, we have to get to the market to buy intermediate in West Africa and then in the North Sea. And this sort of changes our feedstock the way we\u2019re going to feed our system. And what was the second question? Joe Gorder : Yes, Roger, could you restate your second question. Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo : Yes, it was just more along the lines of I was pointing out with the EIA having come out with that report on gasoline, whether that had any impact on these projects overall. I mean, originally these were going to be online in \u201815, so I was just trying to figure out if you were maybe the question is why are they now \u201816 instead of \u201815, or just delayed on construction or was there \u2013 you\u2019re looking at it internally and showing well, if things change maybe we don\u2019t want to go forward? Lane Riggs : Now, the projects were always sort of in the fourth quarter \u201815, first quarter \u201816 and it\u2019s about mechanical completions versus oil and bay. There has not been any delay with them or not, it\u2019s about these projects and we\u2019re going forward with them. Because we\u2019re not really about trying to produce more gasoline and more diesel this is about trying to feed our system more economically right with domestic role, which were imported in release. Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay. And then, as you look at the fourth quarter here relative to the third quarter in terms of what we\u2019ve seen in crude differentials. How is it shaking up for you, I mean, I know we can look at the screens and make our guesses but are you seeing anything significantly different in terms of the Gulf Coast, let\u2019s call it the light-heavies here? Joe Gorder : No, not anything too significant. Overall when you look at the LLS market in Mars, Mars continues to price competitive with LLS. And I think the heavies continue to price competitively with Mars. As you move west in the Gulf, you start to see a bigger advantage to run some of the light sweep, but that\u2019s not too different from what we saw in the third quarter. Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our following question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan: Hi, good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning. John Locke : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan: Yes, a couple of questions. First, first one is just on the cash flow for the quarter and just the \u2013 what\u2019s the working capital contribution might have been. I know there is a few sizable negatives in the first quarter for working capital. I wasn\u2019t sure if there was a reversal of the big positive over the fourth quarter of last year, just kind of where we stand on working capital in general and how to think about that in the fourth quarter? Mike Ciskowski : Okay. Our change in cash for the quarter was an increase of $700 million. And of that amount about $300 million of that was attributable to working capital so we had an increase in our payables receivable in that. So that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s going to be a timing issue most likely. Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan: And for the fourth quarter, any thoughts on whether there is additional contribution? Mike Ciskowski : Towards the end of the year, as we manage around the life of inventory levels there, things so that we could have a reduction in our working capital. Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay. And then, just with respect to the cash flow generation profile in general obviously, very strong and your stock is cheaper around free cash flow yield than most refiners. So I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about kind of impacting that valuation rather, you\u2019ve talked \u2013 obviously talked about the MLP structure as an opportunity but whether it\u2019s increasing buybacks or meaningful step-up in the dividend or something else you can do to change the game? I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re thinking about things? Joe Gorder : Phil, that\u2019s a good question. I mean, when we look at the use of cash, we\u2019ve got some very good projects. So we\u2019re going to continue with the projects that we have underway these very strong returns and they make us much more efficient. And we realize that there is a balance between investments for growth in returning cash to shareholders. Now, I think our actions in the third quarter and through this year really reflect its realization. And we\u2019ve had two dividend increases and we\u2019ve had increased share repurchases while continuing with the growth projects that improve our overall business. And to the extent that we have free cash flow going forward and to the extent that there are, tremendous capital projects to use the cash for. I think you can see us continue on this path. And we\u2019ll be comfortable with returning it to shareholders. Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll turn it on. Operator : Our following question comes from Mohit Bhardwaj from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks for taking my question. Joe, if you could just tackle this follow-up on your comments about the landing mason. If you look at where the crude prices are right now and it seems like there is excess crude supply in the Atlantic Basin. What do you think it does for the refining business in the U.S. and how do you think production moves or these supply moves going forward? Joe Gorder : Okay, I\u2019ll let Gary Simmons give you a shot at that. Gary Simmons : Very difficult to state. I think the key question there, is what is the marginal cost of production in North America versus other regions in the globe, and of course we\u2019re not an upstream company. So, I don\u2019t really know how all that shakes out. I think the assumption you\u2019re kind of making with the question is that as crude price falls in the North American production falls with, the flat price falls. And that may happen, but I really don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure to be able to comment on that. Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup: Right. So, if you look at third quarter versus fourth quarter, one other thing that you said for the third quarter was that you were utilizing the front of the refining, a lot more is sort of little bit more in utilizing the downstream, it\u2019s little less and where the VGO prices and availability of light speed crude. Or do you think that\u2019s still the case in the fourth quarter? Joe Gorder : Lane. Lane Riggs : I\u2019ll try to take a shot at this, this is Lane. Our signals in the third quarter were obviously max on everything. And to the extent that we\u2019re signaled around high crude rate half way to the 1,000 crude margins. And we had really good converging unit margins because VGO prices were inexpensive. We still see those signals going forward in the fourth quarter, they\u2019re not as strong as they were in the third quarter but they\u2019re still have signals put on our system relatively bold. Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup: Right. And one final one from me, just on the diamond pipeline. So, just to be clear, you guys have not exercised the 50% option on the pipelines yet? And if you could also follow-up on if you look at some of your peers were talking about doing a study on cap line and you were the main consumer as far as Memphis refinery is concerned on cap line. Does diamond pipeline option also allow you to sort of if there is a reversible cap line to participate in that? Joe Gorder : Rich, do you want to? Rich Lashway : Yes, I\u2019ll take a crack at that. So, the diamond pipeline is progressing. It is connected it will be connected to the cap line. So, today, we\u2019re connected \u2013 Memphis is connected to the cap line pipeline. So we have dual supply source into the Memphis refinery potentially and be able to take advantage of a reversal. I think they\u2019re just undertaking a study as we speak, so maybe some time before that actually becomes reality. Joe Gorder : As far as the option on the diamond pipeline. Rich Lashway : So, yes, I\u2019m sorry, I missed that first part. So, on the option, we have not exercised the option. We have that option through early January of \u201816 to make that decision. Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup: All right. Thank you for taking my questions. Joe Gorder : Sure Mohit. Operator : Our following question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hi, good afternoon guys. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Evan. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Joe, can you walk us through the decision to reduce 2015 CapEx sequentially from \u201814 and is that a top-down decision to raise distributable cash or a function of higher hurdle rates or the project queue, particularly in relation to midstream? Joe Gorder : No, is it related to the midstream? Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : It is just in total, you ditched down sequentially, is that a desire to increase distributable cash flow or a function of how those each projects shook out in the review process? Joe Gorder : No, it\u2019s the latter. As we \u2013 we started with a list of projects. And if you look at it from the refining perspective, Lane has the process that he goes through tremendous rigorous review. And I think the fact that he\u2019s got this rigorous review shows up in the timing on the methanol project, right. It\u2019s a big project, and we want to be sure that we\u2019ve got the capital right. So he\u2019s going through this in a very methodical way, just to be sure on target. We put together a list of prospective projects and we do this every year. And what we\u2019re doing now is we, our list of projects that we talk about are those we scrubbed at the point that we feel that there is a reasonable probability that we\u2019re going to do them. So, the projects we feel we could execute next year from either the refining side or the logistic side, as we\u2019ve included in the budget, we feel we\u2019re fairly committed to that 2.65 million numbers, $150 million from ethanol is kind of let\u2019s see what we get. But it is a kind of bottom-up, what projects do we have to take a look at and then we look at it from the top-down and say these are the ones that we want to undertake based on the return thresholds. There is though, a general view among this management team that we\u2019d like to try to return more cash to shareholders. And so, having a capital and having our capital at this level is something we\u2019re very comfortable with. We believe it creates that proper value between, proper balance between continued investment to grow and optimize the business and rewarding the shareholder for his loyalty to us. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : And just for clarification, I think in the opening, you stated that midstream is 50% of that growth CapEx, it releases 30% which would be sequentially down. Is it, which of the two is midstream is a function of growth? Joe Gorder : No, I think if you look at \u201814 versus \u201815, we\u2019ve got significant investment for example in the rail carts in 2014. That falls off. We have it intentionally tried to reduce the investments that we\u2019re making in the midstream side of the business. Okay, what we\u2019ve got is probably timing issues here, developing the projects in the form where we\u2019re willing to put them in to the capital budget, that\u2019s all we\u2019re dealing with. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. So, mid \u2013 plus $390 million I guess its $390 million I presume if it\u2019s that 30% figure. And then, should we, is that right? Ashley Smith : Hi Evan, this is Ashley. Yes, you\u2019re correct. So, we\u2019re going from \u201814, it was over 50% of our capital with the logistics and it\u2019s because of rail power is falling off, it\u2019s going to be next year, little over 30%. And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s right around $400 million in logistics. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Great. So, the MLP, I believe the EBITDA exists be around $70 million-ish kind of estimate, is that reasonable? Ashley Smith : It certainly keeps growing. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Right, great. All right, good luck. I look forward to your analysis of larger scope of droppable assets and good results guys. Joe Gorder : Thanks a lot. Ashley Smith : Thanks Evan. Operator : Our following question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi, pretty soon we\u2019re just going to call this logistics conference calls as opposed to refining conference calls. Joe Gorder : We did notice that Ed. Gary Simmons : If they\u2019re truly higher, we\u2019ll do it. Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Yes. I will be most pulled arbitrage is pretty obvious. But, so let\u2019s carry on that lane. So, diamond pipe, any sort of color on the EBITDA that that might contribute if you guys work with that plan or overall investment level? Mike Ciskowski : Well, I think we\u2019ve talked about the cost being approximately $900 million, and when we look at a proper most pulling around 10 times that would give you $90 million and 50% of that would kind of back you into $45 million of EBITDA. Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great. And then, another strategic, I mean, obviously I don\u2019t know, you must have seen the EPG Oil-Tanking Acquisition which was somewhat elevated multiple. And obviously assuming that there was going to be a lot of export drugs to obviously drive throughputs and drive that multiple down. So, I look at your logistics and your refining system in Texas, I look at what Phillip 66 has done at Vermont and the Bakken pipe project as associated with that. I look at the Permian and the Eagle Ford and still growing, and I think there has to be something to be done. So, how, am I off in terms of the landscape or while that, competitive barriers for you being able to compete as effectively? Joe Gorder : I mean, there is competitive barriers to everything right, but there is no reason that we can\u2019t compete effectively with this. And as I mentioned earlier, we talked about the capital. We\u2019ve included in the capital budget project we\u2019re highly confident we\u2019re going to do. The one exception is that methanol plant, I\u2019m not saying we will or won\u2019t do it we\u2019re just still in the process of looking at it. But we\u2019ve got a lot of logistics projects right now that Rich Lashway and his team are in the process of developing. They\u2019re not far enough well to include in the capital budget but they would be logistics type path that would use to support the existing refining portfolio. And there\u2019s some of them that look like they are very good projects. Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. And then, I should ask a refining question. The turnarounds obviously were pretty high as you connected up a lot of the hydrocrakers and did lot of reliability work in \u201812 and \u201813, and obviously still in the second quarter in off seeds. Easy to see, how good your throughputs were in the third quarter. As you look out from here, I mean, do you feel that you have a more reliable refining system or is that still more work that needs to be done to get the reliability to where you need it to be? And maybe a comment on general turnaround schedules into next year? Lane Riggs : Yes, this is Lane. So, our last really big liability projects we did and we\u2019re looking at systems that in the quarter and that were replacing the reactors. We went and now we\u2019re in the process of starting up the Meraux hydrocracker which should begin, sort of reconfigure in that refiner. We don\u2019t really have anything quite like that going forward in our capital plan. It\u2019s sort of, we\u2019re going to be in premium, doesn\u2019t really impact our throughputs per say. So, really from here going forward, we just have our round phase, our regimen of standard turnaround execution themselves. Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Yes, that was all things equal we should expect that sort of overall utilization next year and perhaps a year after than the last three year run-rate? Lane Riggs : Yes, and we always, I mean, our number one focus on everything we do is to try, with first is safety. But right behind that is really liability. And we do never squeeze for reliability stand, is actually slowing. And we\u2019re pretty confident that we have spent the right money on the right things to maintain a higher liability rate in our system. Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Very clear, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company: Hi, good morning everybody. Joe Gorder : Hi Sam. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company: Lots have been covered, I guess, I\u2019ll stick to ethanol if refining questions are I say we do. So, the business has responded really well to lower corn prices obviously results have been getting better and better. Just strategically, do you think you can, it can tolerate any kind of stabilizing business component, a tolling agreement or something like that that might make it eligible for a different structure or is this just normal volatility in the industry with a really good corn crop this year in your mind? Joe Gorder : Martin, you want to speak to the market aspect of this. Martin Parish : Sure, Sam, this is Martin Parish. On the market aspect, we like where we\u2019re positioned. Production has been high as you can see inventories have only built like a million barrels in total for the year. So, we feel really good, we\u2019re positioned exports are high. We think margins going forward are going to be good, we like the business. Now, as far as the totaling type deal, I mean, Sam, what do you think in there, is this a question about doing what to monetize the business or? Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company: Yes, I suppose, I mean, it\u2019s been a pretty steady stream of better on better results in the segment until, you mentioned your similar parts earlier, I was just wondering if this sectors into it at all, I know that if maybe you see earnings getting more reliable or visible in the segment? Joe Gorder : We like the delay at these levels forever. But I think 2012 it was, it would remind us there can be a lot of volatility in this business too. And we\u2019ve looked at this the ethanol plant portfolio and if you look at costs, there just aren\u2019t a whole bunch of them first of all. And it tends to trade at the same multiples as the refining assets trade at. So, there is really not a big significant incentive for whether monetization through try to create additional value. At the same time, I would say that we\u2019re very pleased with the operation of the business. Martin has done a fine job leading it he\u2019s got a very settled team. And the cash flow is being produced by these assets is tremendous. And we feel like having it as part of our core business. And we do believe long-term that ethanol is going to be fundamentally part of the fuel mix instead of having this businesses part of our portfolio makes sense. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company: Okay. And then, just touching on that as a follow-up and the RFS seemed to be a little bit behind schedule on an update here. It seems like your thesis is quite out based on refining margins, that rings were kind of being pass through. Is that, do you see that as giving momentum into maybe mandate reduction or any kind of movement at all if you can get any update that would be great? Gary Simmons : I don\u2019t know if we have lot of insight here. I think we feel like it\u2019s going to be after the elections here before we get the new RBO. And it\u2019s so late in the year at this stage that we don\u2019t think it will be potentially different from where we were last year. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company: Okay, great. Joe Gorder : It is pretty interesting that we\u2019re here in November we don\u2019t know what the 2014 obligation number is yet. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company: Interesting is one word for it, yes, I guess. Joe Gorder : Thank you, Pal. Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company: Okay. Well, thanks a lot guys. Have a good one. Joe Gorder : Okay, you too. Operator : Our following question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research : Hi, good morning everyone. Joe Gorder : Hi, good morning Paul. Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research : You\u2019ve covered a lot of ground here with getting to the point of the ethanol MLP. I wanted to ask you a follow-up on that one. Could we just sort of be able to gather a bit here Joe, what concerns I mean, I think we were hoping for quite a significant debt down in CapEx late this year? And what I\u2019m listening to is that you\u2019re competing in a mature market, but you\u2019re still spending on these numbers about doubled your maintenance or stay-in business CapEx, would be remained at being obviously growth CapEx? Can\u2019t we get to a place where you are much more aggressive about cash return to shareholders as the kind of predominant aim? I heard good stuff about you potentially not doing any methanol project but at the same time there seems to be a potential for logistics and to step up, and I would say, to me, this is a CapEx number which is kind of flat next year with this year whereas we were hoping for something that is quite a bit lower? Thanks. Joe Gorder : Okay, Paul, I know this has been your perspective. We look at the capital, okay. We got $1.4 billion or $1.5 billion that we spend on the assets to maintain them the way we want to maintain them. We\u2019ve got the crude unit project which have 25% plus rates of return, and they\u2019re not putting anymore juice in the market per say. They\u2019re optimization projects. We\u2019ve got the opportunity to drop at higher multiples logistics assets. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in those. If you extract the methanol plant $150 million our place holder from the $2.8 billion or $2.65 billion that is well below the $3 billion that we forecasted this year. And we don\u2019t arbitrarily select projects to undertake to outlook if the alternative use for the cash. And so, if we\u2019re deciding to do a capital project, I think we\u2019re very comfortable making our day in sports in sharing what the returns are going to look like on this and why it\u2019s a better alternative to us and repurchasing shares for example. So, I do think that this management team has reduced the capital spend, I think if we look at it going forward with the rigor we have in the process and the thresholds we\u2019re setting for acceptance of the projects, we\u2019re going to see this continue to be at this level. It may continue to decline. But I don\u2019t want to not do projects that improve the operation of the business and have good returns when they are available to us. Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research : Yes, then I guess the plan is really what you\u2019re saying is you have to see European refineries shut down, it will also make room for some of the stuff. And thus, it\u2019s the concern we have there is too much capital going into the business overall that\u2019s kind of dependent on the competitive environment moving into favor? Joe Gorder : Okay. Gary Simmons : Paul, keep in mind, our projects are designed principally to reduce feedstock cost. And if we have cheaper crude, we\u2019re going to shut down that\u2019s going to force excess capacity and you have to shut down, so we will become more competitive. Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research : Great. And just my final part of this is, what do you think a competitive return to shareholders is, you\u2019ve got a couple of percent yield. Can you just talk a little bit more about that Joe and I\u2019ll leave it there? Thanks. Joe Gorder : I\u2019m sorry Paul, real quick you\u2019re talking about is VLP or are you talking about Valero Energy? Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research : Well, just yes, for example if I own a Valero share, how do you think, what do you think of this being a good return to the shareholder in terms of you saying that you respect full of cash return to shareholders? Joe Gorder : From a cash perspective or just total? Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research : Yes, total side. I mean, people obviously prefer regular dividend but I understand that they look at the business makes sense, a tough commitment to discuss? Joe Gorder : Okay. And I think what we would say is we have a cost of capital, we got a cost of capital there which We haven\u2019t set a target per say, but 10% range, 12% range and it\u2019s certainly going to be the dividend, the share repurchase aspect of it. But we recognize that we\u2019ve got a need to exceed counts of capital on our projects in our business. Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research : Understood. Thank you very much, Joe. Operator : Last question comes from Allen Good from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar: Good morning, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be brief, it\u2019s getting here late. Suncor CEO made some comments last week about shipping medium heavy to Europe and down the U.S. Atlantic Coast and even to a Gulf Coast. Do you think there is a viable alternative long-term to get greater, heavy volumes to the Gulf Coast and could that even be a potentially a source of opportunity for Pembroke at some point? Joe Gorder : Yes. So, of course for us, I think we feel like there is, better options to get Canadian heavy to the U.S. Gulf Coast and taking it to the East Coast and around. But absence of any of those opportunities moving forward, we definitely see it\u2019s an option to get additional heavy side to the Gulf. And we also see that there is an opportunity to move the Canadian barrels to Pembroke as well. Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar: Great, thanks. And then, could you just give us an update on the projects you have either to weigh or sort of on a planned stages to increase competitiveness of California and get some discount crude out there and just your latest thoughts on your assets out there as well? Lane Riggs : Allen, this is Lane. That would also we are still working on the Venetian rail project. Our comments her are, we\u2019re working on those, answering all the questions and we sort of expect that to be finished in December. We think permits would be issued in the first quarter. That\u2019s really the \u2013 in terms of the strategic capital that we have spending on the West Coast, that\u2019s pretty much it. Everything else would be very careful in our, spend on the West Coast. Because we have obviously great opportunities in our Gulf Coast and our Mid-Continent market on North Eastern capital. So, we\u2019re very careful, we run a very tight shift out there and that\u2019s sort of how we\u2019re managing the West Coast. Joe Gorder : And then, from a strategic perspective, we think it\u2019s great to have good assets with strong management teams out there that provide us the option to take advantage of the strong market environment we have from time to time out there. Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar: Great. Thanks I appreciate it. Operator : Okay. We have no further questions at this time, yes sorry. Joe Gorder : Well, that\u2019s okay. I was just going to say, we appreciate everyone calling in and listening to the call today. If you have additional questions or didn\u2019t get a chance to ask your question, please contact our Investor Relations department. Thank you. Operator : Okay. Thank you to all speakers and thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Hilda, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke. Mr. Locke, you may begin. John Locke : Thank you, Hilda. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions about the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for an update on company operations and strategy. Joseph Gorder : Well, thanks very much, John, and good morning, everyone. Well, as John will cover in more detail momentarily, we did have a great fourth quarter and a great year. What I'd like to do is spend a few minutes discussing our key strategies and highlight a few of our accomplishments in the quarter. As you have seen from our recent disclosure, our strategies are focused on operations excellence, returning capital to stockholders, maintaining disciplined capital investments and unlocking asset value. Operations excellence continues to be important to us. Our team understands that reliability drive safe and profitable operations, so we are relentlessly committed here. An example of this can be seen in our Meraux refinery, where we completed our reliability improvement program and the hydrocracker revamp project. We expect the investments we've made here to improve the refinery for liability and performance. Disciplined capital allocation is another key focus for us. Last week, we increased our regular cash quarterly dividend by 45% to $0.40 per share or $1.60 annualized. This increase demonstrates our belief in Valero's earnings power and our commitment to returning cash to stockholders. Regarding capital investments, we completed our 2014 capital program under budget, as noted in the release. This resulted from the rigor and discipline that Lane and his team applied to spending throughout Valero's gated project management process. We're committed to applying the same rigor to future investments. The majority of our growth investments for 2015 and 2016 are allocated to logistics, and to increasing our capability to access and process advantage crude oil for our flexible refining system. We expect the majority of the logistics investments to be eligible for future drops to Valero Energy Partners, which is our sponsored master limited partnership. On the topic of VLP, we're committed to its growth and unlocking value. As we noted in the release, we're targeting approximately $1 billion of drops into VLP in 2015. At that level of growth, we also expect VLP's distribution to exceed the 50% tier for our general partner and incentive distribution rights by the end of this year. We're continuing to evaluate and structure new potential earning streams that can be dropped to VLP, and those represent incremental growth opportunities. We understand the MLP landscape has changed since our IPO, and we're committed unlocking value. In summary, we're focused on operational excellence, disciplined capital allocation and value creation. Our team remains committed to high performance and achievement. And with that, John, I'll go ahead and turn it over to you to cover the results. John Locke : Thank you, Joe. As shown in our earnings release, we had another strong quarter. We reported fourth quarter 2014 earnings from continuing operations of $1.2 billion or $2.22 per share. Adjusting for special items described on Page 7 of the financial table that accompany our release, we are at $952 million or $1.83 per share, which compares to $963 million or $1.78 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $3.7 billion or $6.97 per share. Adjusting for special items, we earned $3.5 billion or $6.68 per share in 2014 versus $2.4 billion or $4.41 per share in 2013. The refining segment reported fourth quarter 2014 operating income of $1.9 billion versus $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Nearly all of the $377 million increase in operating income resulted from the previously noted special items. Excluding the special items, operating income was flat in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus the fourth quarter of 2013, as stronger gasoline, distillate and other product margins relative to Brent crude oil as well as higher refining throughput volumes were offset by lower discounts for sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 41,000 barrels per day versus the fourth quarter of 2013. Refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $3.76 per barrel, which is $0.03 per barrel lower than the fourth quarter of 2013. The ethanol segment generated $158 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus $269 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease in Ethanol segment operating income was mainly due to a $0.31 per gallon decrease in gross margin, driven by lower gasoline and ethanol prices with relatively stable corn prices. Production from the Mount Vernon plant contributed to record quarterly ethanol production volumes, which averaged 3.8 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2014. General and administrators expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $214 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, which is $35 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to changes in legal reserves. Also in the fourth quarter of 2014, net interest expense was $101 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $425 million. The effective tax rate was 28.4%. The rate was lower than normal, due primarily to earnings from our international operations that were higher than projected and taxed at statutory rates that are lower than in U.S., the biodiesel blender's tax credit that was passed into law in December and a reversal of certain tax reserves. With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end total debt was $6.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $3.7 billion, of which $237 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash and excluding VLP was 17.4%.Valero had approximately $6.1 billion of available liquidity in addition to cash, including VLP's $300 million of available liquidity. Cash flows in the fourth quarter included $857 million in capital expenditures, of which $157 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. In the fourth quarter we returned $640 million in cash to our stockholders, which included $143 million in dividend payments and $497 million in purchases of approximately 10.3 million shares of Valero common stock. Our total cash returned to stockholders for 2014 was $1.9 billion, a 33% increase over 2013, and included $554 million in dividend payments and purchases of 25.7 million shares for $1.3 billion. For 2015 and 2016, we maintain our guidance for capital expenditures, including turnarounds and catalysts. In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $2.65 billion, consisting of approximately $1.5 billion for same business capital and $1.15 billion for growth investment, and this excludes $150 million for St. Charles methanol project that remains under evaluation. For 2016, we expect to spend approximately $2.4 billion, consisting of $1.4 billion for stay-in-business capital and $1 billion for growth investments, excluding $300 million for the St. Charles methanol project. For modeling, our first quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall in the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.45 million to 1.5 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 240,000 to 260,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be around $4.20 per barrel. For ethanol operations in the first quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.7 million gallons per day. And operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation for the first quarter to be around $170 million and net interest expense should be about $100 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter should be approximately $449 and our effective tax rate should be around 33%. Operator, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we will open the call to questions. During this segment, we request that our callers limit each turn to two questions. Callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi Chow : I've got a couple of questions regarding your very strong performance in the Gulf Coast region. I guess, first, can you explain the gross margin adjustments you've shown in the back of the table, in particularly that blender's tax credit and how that's going to be sustainable going forward? And then secondly, even with the adjustments, it looks like your capture rate was very strong sequentially versus 3Q, when all the indicated cracks were down. And just wondering if you could explain some of the factors that were coming into play versus the indicated? Michael Ciskowski : The blender's tax credit, that was passed into the law in December for 2014, so it was available to us last year. At this point it's not hatch for 2015, so we would not have that in our earnings going forward. Joseph Gorder : And on the margin capture, Gary, you want speak to that. Gary Simmons : Yes. I would say, in the Gulf Coast margin capture is largely attributable to great performance from the hydrocrackers in terms of refinery operation. And then we also begin to see some good advantages on running some of the South American heavy sour crude again in our Gulf Coast system in fourth quarter. Chi Chow : How much impact was there, just with the decline in crude prices? And is that something that if crude prices stabilize or eventually increases kind of the capture rate going to switch there versus what we saw in the fourth quarter? Gary Simmons : We definitely see some benefits in terms of capture rate and a lower flat price. It's mainly the other products that we produce, the sulfur and coke, LPG, those types of things. Now, when the flat price is lower we tend to have higher capture rate, because those products tend to be a little sticky with crude. Chi Chow : I guess one final question on the Gulf Coast. Looks like the Maya light/heavy differentials is pretty wide here in the first quarter so far on percentage basis. How has your crudes slate changed versus 4Q? It looks like you ran a lot of light crudes in the fourth quarter. Has that change here going forward? And do you have any sort of earnings sensitivity for the Maya spread? Gary Simmons : Yes. I guess to answer the question on our crude diet, we tend to buy crude out quite a ways. So probably the first month you start seeing a significant change in our crude diet would be large. And we have started to move in the direction that exactly what you talked about as several of our Gulf Coast refiners were backing down on some of the light domestic type crude and starting to run a higher percentage of medium sour crudes and heavy sour crudes, those have been more economic for us to process in the Gulf. Chi Chow : So do you have any sort of EPS sensitivity to changes in the light/heavy? Joseph Gorder : No, actually we don't. Operator : The next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : You all announced a pretty substantial dividend increase last week I think. Has that changed your thoughts at all on the buyback? And how do you think about dividend versus buyback in general and then versus capital projects or acquisitions? Joseph Gorder : Mike, you want to? Michael Ciskowski : Yes. We're working really to returning more of our cash to our stockholders based on our analysis of the market data and capital allocation scenarios. We are still interested in higher return projects, but our capital is down, projected as we disclosed, so we thought it was appropriate to increase the dividend at that level. So we're going to be looking at exceeding our payout ratio going forward in 2015 on what we've had the last couple of years. Joseph Gorder : As far as our consideration of the dividend versus buybacks, when we did the analysis and looked at where our dividend was relative to the peer group, we felt that we were a little bit low. And so this type of move was something to get us more aligned with the other guys. It is also something that we view as being non-discretionary when we look at our use of cash going forward. The share repurchases, we are committed to trying to achieve a metric that we defined internally, and we're going to continue to pursue that as Mike said, but that will be more flexible for us than the dividend, which we consider to be, as I mentioned, non-discretionary. Brad Heffern : And then looking at refined product exports for the fourth quarter, do you have a figure that you can provide us how much you exported? And can you also talk about how demand is looking for those exported barrels? Gary Simmons : Yes. In the fourth quarter we did 139,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports. On the distillate side, ULSD, we did 280,000 barrels a day. In addition to the ULSD, we also exported kerosene and jet, and if you included that total distillates would be 255,000 barrels a day. In terms of the current market, I would tell you we're starting to see some incentive to export gasoline again, especially to Latin America and to Canada. Most of the distillate are through strength in the Gulf, there is not a lot of incentives to do much distillate export in the current market. Operator : The next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Just a follow-up on the capital allocation question. You talk about having a payout ratio that exceeds 50% of net income for 2014. Consensus actually has EPS down year-over-year. You also have some excess cash. You have just accelerated drop program. So I was just trying to calculate how high you're comfortable going in 2015 as a percentage of net income, if indeed consensus is right? Joseph Gorder : Well, I figured that you'd probably ask a question like this. And really the target we've set is the one we've stated, it's to exceed the previous year. Now, as I mentioned previously, internally we've got a target that would be higher than that. But I am not prepared right now to give you a fixed percentage for the overall payout ratio. I just think we need to see how the year evolves. Look at the dynamic nature of the market that we are dealing with today. Are we're seeing crude go from a $100 late last year to $50 this year. And so for me to give you a committed number right now is something that's probably just wouldn't be prudent to do. So I think for now, if I were you, I would just assume that we're going to exceed the 50% target and go with that. Phil Gresh : And that actually keens up my next question, which is just in your general outlook for the market, as we exit '16, it's starting to look like crude oil production growth could actually be down year-over-year. There is talk of increased global refine capacity. So given this dynamic market, I'd love to hear your general big picture views and just how you're thinking about planning for this type of environment? Joseph Gorder : That's a fine question. Gary Simmons is so very close to this, let us let him go ahead and comment on it. Gary Simmons : So overall, I think we see that the crude market will continue to be in a oversupplied position for foreseeable future. I think the fact that the Saudis have signaled that they are going to continue to put medium sour barrels on the market will mean that our medium sour differential should remain supportive. The combination of that with additional Canadian heavy into the Gulf, we believe it will give us good heavy sour differentials as well. So both of those things we think are very supportive in terms of our Valero's performance moving forward. When you turn to the refined product side, I think it's a little unclear at this stage to see exactly what will happen with refinery margins. However, we think that the fall off in flat price, we should see a positive demand response, and you have been able to see that in the past few weeks from the DOE stats. And so as demand increases, that should also be supportive of refining margins. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Paul Cheng : Two questions. First, if I look at your margin capture rate against your Valero index that you posted in your website, it was quite amazing that the last two year, 2013 and 2014 versus the two year before in 2011, 2012, your capture rate actually improved somewhere between 3% to 9% between these two period, with the exception of the West Coast. So wondering if you can have a stat, I'm trying to quantify, how much of the improvement you think is just that the market condition is just in favor of your configuration and how much of that is really based on the better operation, reliability that you guys has been able to improve? And how much is related to the large capital investment in the previous years you guys have made and have subsequently come on stream. The second question -- or that you want to answer that before I go to the second? Joseph Gorder : Paul, I'd tell you, we'll let Garry speak to this, but just as member of management for last several years, I'd like first to take credit for all of it. That being said, Garry, you want to give your view. Gary Simmons : Yes. So I will tell you, Paul, probably you have to look at this regionally. And when you look to the Mid-Continent, some of our improvement capture rate has just been due to the fact that the Midland market has been very disconnected from the Cushing market over the past couple of years and the wider Midland spreads. We're running a lot of Midland barrels to Ardmore and McKee, it certainly helped our capture rates there. Same thing in the North Atlantic Basin. I would say a lot of that is market driven. Especially as we transition Quebec from a foreign crude diet to a North American light sweet crude diet. We saw a significant increase in our capture rate there. However, in the Gulf, I would say that the improvement in capture rate is primarily just the fact that we're seeing a lot better yield and the operational improvements we've made in our Gulf Coast at this time. Paul Cheng : And how much is the benefit is just coming from the investment that you guys have been making. Is there any way that we can quantify it? Joseph Gorder : In the recent analyst presentations we've put together, we have included a lot of information on the economics associated with the projects. And the hydrocrackers are the one that we tend to focus on. I think what you can expect is that we'll continue to disclose this information as we go forward. And we obviously believe when the capital that's been invested over the last several years, it's had a significant effect, not only in, for example, the hydrocracker projects in driving the capture rates relative to more distillate production, but the increase in the reliability in our system and so on, it's all beneficial. We haven't tried to pin down specifically what's related to what, but I think we can all see it in the results. Paul Cheng : A final one. I think that there is a change in your project investments decision process comparing to the past. Maybe that you can elaborate a little bit more in terms of what condition may have change or what criteria you have changed differently now? Lane Riggs : So as you mentioned we're booking them for deliberate gated process, really what we look for are the projects that will enter our gated systems. We don't even look at them unless they have sort of 50% IRR as to gate one. And then also we right now have a tendency to be a little bit more focused towards the stock optimization, and not as nearly as large as maybe some of the projects that we did started in the past. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company. Jeff Dietert : There has been some refining margin strength in Europe and on the U.S. East Coast, the Atlantic Basin refining margins overall have been pretty healthy relative to the other regions. Could you talk about what factors you believe are contributing to the strength as a marginal product on the U.S. East Coast? Is it supply by U.S. Gulf Coast via the Jones Act ship? Or what do you think is causing the strength in the Atlantic Basin? Gary Simmons : I think you hit exactly on it. We saw the New York harbor market get very strong. The colonial pipeline is always full, so that means the barrel is flowing in there to set the price, it's either a barrel from the U.S. Gulf Coast on Jones Act ship or a barrel from Western Europe, and so to incentivize imports and incentivize the flow off with Jones Act ship from the Gulf, the harbor market had to strengthen. Jeff Dietert : So Jones Act laws are actually increasing prices on the East Coast? Gary Simmons : Yes. Jeff Dietert : Secondly, I was hoping you could comment on the EPA and the renewable fuel standard, and what you're anticipating could happen there? Rents prices have risen with the uncertainty that's been created there. Could you comment on that issue? Gary Simmons : Yes. So we're still waiting for the final numbers for '14 and the numbers for '15 to come out from the EPA. We're hopeful we'll have something by the end of March, that's kind of what we're hearing and as you pointed too. Until those numbers are set, we see the red market as being very volatile. And so we're hopeful, we'll get some direction here pretty soon from EPA. Operator : The next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez : My questions on the VLP drop. Appreciate the more aggressive strategy. The way I had kind of envisioned this in the past was kind of progressive increase over time. So I'm just curious, do you think the $1 billion in '15 kind of sets a baseline to where we should expect progressive increases into '16, '17, et cetera? Joseph Gorder : This drop, as you mentioned, is really much larger than we have previously planned. But we have quite a portfolio of logistics assets, which we've mentioned and obviously this level of drop is based on the EBITDA that we have in the system will allow us to sustain this level of drops for some years to come. It's our intention to continue to drop at a pace that makes sense for Valero and for VLP. As you know, we continue to invest in logistics projects to support the refining operations, and then Mike Ciskowski and his team are evaluating additional sources of qualifying EBITDA, so to get from the fuels distribution business. So when we look at our portfolio today, we believe that this is sustainable for some period of time. If you look at VLP specifically, we stated in our plans were to increase the distribution 20% to 25% a year. And based on this particular drop, I think that you can expect that we're certainly going to be at the high range of that for this year and it looks like it's very sustainable going forward. Blake Fernandez : Second question, the OpEx guidance you have of $420 a barrel, if I'm not mistaken that seemed a little bit higher than where we've been trending last year. And I'm just curious if there is anything in there that's driving that? And maybe if you could tie in with that as we kind of move more towards heavy sour runs. Should we expect that to kind of create some upward pressure on the operating cost? Lane Riggs : So the guidance really, as a function, that we have some turnaround activity that's going to occur here late in the first quarter, so our volumes are a little bit lower. And then, I would also say, that the outlook is pretty consistent in terms of our natural gas price from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, so that's sort of the reasons we have the guidance where it is. Blake Fernandez : And if you don't mind, just any comments on, again with the heavy sour coming back in the favor, should we think would that have kind of upward pressure on operating cost moving forward? Lane Riggs : No. Not really. Operator : The next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio : My first question is it's a different take on the prior question on the outlook. And you addressed the souring and heaving crude oil global slate with higher OPEC market share growing over Mexico and Canadian production. Can you discuss the developing and steepening contango and how it benefits Valero, especially given the structural way in which the crude markets are being forced to balance with the U.S. as the new swing producer? Gary Simmons : Really the contango market structure is yet a good indication that the crude market is over supplied. And so as a buyer of crude, Valero benefits from the competition from producers to gain market share. So we think this is supported for us for at least the next couple of years. Evan Calio : Can you quantify how much you're hedging on PI to avail one to two or one to three months contango? And how you think about your own storage assets in this market or even do you see the potential for U.S. storage filling? Gary Simmons : So I think definitely when you look at the economics of what you can get tankage in Cushing, those economics are supportive of putting oil in tankage and storing it there. I think we'll continue to see Cushing builds. I read something this morning. They expect Cushing to continue to build about 1.5 million barrels a week until through April. In terms of us, particularly we do some of that. We don't do a lot of it. When we choose to put barrels in storage and take advantage of contango, it's also for other reasons. So we may see an opportunistic barrel that we think has a good discount. We might not be able to fit it into our systems. So then we'll go ahead and put those in tankage in Aruba and take advantage of the contango, and also what looks to be an opportunistic purchase for us. Evan Calio : And just second one for me, maybe more a request for detailed information, if you don't that data. But can you break down the $900 million of MLP-able EBITDA into any sub categories? And I guess, I raised a question in the sense of, one of the subcategories of recent spending in rail, and also has some commodity price exposure to that sub segment. Yet I know, however, you use a significant portion of that rail fleet to move product under ethanol, which should have relatively higher utilization tariff. Any break down or help us in the composition of the EBITDA and/or -- sorry to make this multiple question, I didn't intend to -- or any break down in just that rail segment, how much is product in ethanol? Joseph Gorder : That's fine. Well, because it's a multi-part question, we'll let Rich and Martin Parrish answer it. Obviously, Rich is the President of the VLP, and Martin runs the ethanol business, the renewable business. So why don't we let those two guys speak to this, and see if we can get you some color here. Richard Lashway : So on the rail cars just to kind of break that down a little bit. So obviously they are qualifying to dropdown to VLP. We've created a company to hold these cars and our intent is to drop these cars down and trying to over time. But if you look at the cars that we have, there is a general purpose and they're coiled and insulated cars. The coiled and insulated cars, obviously, fit well into the ethanol business and coiled and insulated would fit into the asphalt and crude and fuel oil business. But our intent would be to drop these down over time in tranches. Martin Parrish : We have about 3,000 cars in ethanol service, the general purpose cars, as Rich said. As those leases expire, we'll take those off and use the VLP cars. As you know, rail is the primary transport for ethanol, we expect these cars will be highly utilized in a good fit for VLP. Joseph Gorder : So now to the broader question on the $900 million, Rich, you want to provide a little more. Richard Lashway : So if you kind of break down broadly the $900 million of EBITDA. So when we were out on the road a year ago, we talked about our retained assets. It's not about $620 million EBITDA and pride upstairs at the parent level. And from '13 and '14 we've got about $140 million [indiscernible] billion capital spending, which is mostly complete. So that would generate roughly another $140 million of EBITDA. So that kind of gives you to an 800 number. And then in '14 we've got another $400 million of capital spending, which generates another $40 million in '16 and '17. We got large spending on our, what we've talked about in the past, the diamond pipeline and some other pipeline projects. So kind of through '17 the capital spending will get you to about $900 million of EBITDA. Evan Calio : Maybe at some point, just color on the types, whether how much is pipeline, how much is storage, how much is rail or fuel marketing distribution to at least better highlight the drop down values given the assets have some different multiples on? Joseph Gorder : We can sure do that. I mean obviously in this case the bulk of this is logistics assets. The number that we're scoring doesn't include anything that will be associated with the fuels marketing business. Operator : Our next question comes from the Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Roger Read : I guess maybe I had a couple questions here. You've done a fairly phenomenal job in last several quarters of outperforming volume expectations, particularly in the Gulf Coast. Clearly from guidance here you're expecting descent amount of turnarounds in the first quarter. Well, could you just sort of give us a -- is it strictly market conditions or have there been other things that have allowed you to outperform sort of volume expectations? And I'm thinking you made comments earlier about the hydrocrackers having run very well in the fourth quarter. Could you just sort of walk us through that maybe how that could imply the stronger results in the first half of the year? John Locke : Roger, our performance, when we give guidance is based on what we plan, we plan conservatively. If the market provides opportunities and we're constantly seeking opportunity, as crude prices or as product prices change, we try to optimize. And if we have the opportunity to go after extra barrels, we'll do it, and that's kind of what you've seen in the last, beside what you talked about here. Joseph Gorder : Well, that's the fact, and then I would tell you that the fact that we've invested capital in the business, the way we've invested it over the last several years in our commitment to continuing to maintain the high levels of our reliability and safety within our refining system, is going to contribute to this. I think what you're beginning to see here is a realization of the value of the investments that have been made. And then the capabilities of this management team to execute to optimize the slates in, the movement of products out, and then the day-to-day operation to the refineries. Roger Read : And then coming back to the other side of that, the comment earlier about distillate exports, not exactly being incentivized in this environment, there's all kinds of seasonal factors and other things going on. But are you seeing anything particularly different on just general volume demand sides here in the U.S.? We've seen descent data, although obviously somewhat we have to be skeptical of exactly what we see on the EI and API on a weekly basis, but look like gasoline demand is better here. And how maybe that's flowing through both in terms of the export market demand-wise not just arbitrage-wise, and then local demand as well? Lane Riggs : Roger, so I would tell you that we have definitely -- since the flat prices have fallen off, we see greater demand for refined products on gasoline and liquid side. That's some of the reason why the Gulf has been supported. And when the Gulf has supported then we might not see quite the incentive to export, if we do. I would tell you we're still sending distillate to South America, so we still see good export demand, not necessarily quite the demand in Europe. And some of the reason for that is that just they've had mild weather in Europe, and to distillate demand has moved down there. Roger Read : And then, just a last question is the North Atlantic margins, if you were to -- I know you don't like to do this, but if you were to break down sort of how Pembroke performed versus how Canada performed. Was there an unusual item? Both units were better, one was better and then other, just any granularity you can offer there? Joseph Gorder : I mean you kind of preface the question by the fact that we work and answer it. So we appreciate you doing that. I mean, both refineries are performing well. And obviously, our Canadian operation, it's a very strong operation, but beyond that I don't think we want to try to get into that detail. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Jason Smith : It's actually Jason Smith on for Doug. Just a follow up on refining projects and being a bit more selective, can you just update us as to where the Benicia unloading facility is, first in the permit process? And then is there incentive on your end moving forward, given the recent narrowing in spreads? Lane Riggs : So we are still working with the city to try to address all the comments that came out. We have only submitted EIR for review, and we're in the process with their folks to continue to push this forward. We're still pretty optimistic we'll get the permit. Timing at this point is a little bit difficult for us to project. I'd say some time early next year would be when we would actually get started putting the crude-by-rail project in place. And I'll let Gary speak to the economics of crude-by-rail right now. Gary Simmons : So I would say, definitely over the last few weeks, whatever Brent TI was, we wouldn't be incentivized there to move crude-by-rail from Benicia. But we're starting to see that arc widen back out, and our view is that we'll see a wider Brent-TI than what we've seen over the last few weeks, and that we believe that we'll have an economic incentive to move the crude to Benicia. Jason Smith : Is there anything in your '15 or '16 budget for that project at this time or is there anything else in your budget for '15 and '16 that could potentially get cut more beyond the methanol project that you guys obviously are slowing down on? Lane Riggs : There is money budgeted in the 2015 budget to forward crude-by-rail. Jason Smith : And then slowing down? Lane Riggs : Literally, that will mean that we'll slow that spend down versus the budget, but we are least succeeded right now. Jason Smith : And just one quick follow-up on the splitter projects, and you guys had talked about $500 million EBITDA in a 2014 environment. Can you give me the frame what those look like in the current environment? Joseph Gorder : So you're talking about the crude topper projects. Jason Smith : Yes. Lane Riggs : Well, what I would do is refer you to our investment on our slides, we have sensitivity. So again, if you're right, the $500 million of EBITDA is based on 2014 prices. In the neighboring next phase right there, we have this whole set of sensitivity from drivers that affect the economics of that project. Operator : The next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company. Sam Margolin : Back to the capture rate question. I guess in light of the outperformance, and then some of the comments you just made in general about crude over supply. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some color on some crude prices that maybe aren't necessarily in the benchmark that we can't see everyday. You mentioned that South American barrels, but I was also wondering about some domestic areas, so that's Huston, South Texas and maybe even the Bakken wellhead, where you have some real exposure too, if there is some contribution for pricing there at discounts below sort of what we see on the boards. Martin Parrish : It's difficult to get into a lot of detail. But we continue to see that if you look at an LOS related market, in terms of the eastern Gulf, the Houston market is discounted a couple of dollars below that. And then you move further west and you get into the Corpus Christi area market. And again, we see another $2 of discount off LOS for an Eagle Ford type barrel. The same thing if you move up into the Mid-Continent, the discounts get deeper as you move up on the light sweet side. On the heavy sour side, definitely we're seeing some incentive to run a lot of the South American barrels. The biggest switch without going into a lot of details on discounts, as the Canadian differentials came in, we started to see an advantage to switch to more Brazilian grades and less Canadian grades, and that's an optimization we do everyday. Sam Margolin : And then switching gears to the dropdown commentary. So the MLP space has obviously been really volatile, VLP has outperformed. So I'm wondering if there is any consideration or any effect on sort of valuation of drop downs in general. There was a question before about the valuation spectrum between types of midstream assets. But I'm just wondering sort of, as a complex, if there has been any impact or as long as VLP is over 10x EBITDA, the dropdown values can stay at 10x EBITDA and there is no real problem. John Locke : We haven't seen any change in drop down multiples of the deals that have been occurring here recently. So they're still at roughly 12% pre-tax for VLP. Operator : The next question comes from Mohit Bhardwaj from Citigroup. Mohit Bhardwaj : The question is on ethanol. You guys just talked about ethanol market in 2015, obviously in 2014 ethanol was a big support and you guys made like $700 million to $800 million in operating margin. Moving to 2015 it looks like the corn prices have kind of held up and ethanol prices are coming down based on the global economics, maybe just talk about that? Martin Parrish : Ethanol margins are likely to remain low in the $50 crude environment. And we don't know how long crude is going to stay at these prices obviously. What we do know is we have the best assets in the ethanol industry in the U.S. and we're in an advantaged location and we know we're not marginal producer. So we expect to weather this time. Mohit Bhardwaj : And market do you expect to remain in the positive territory or do you think right now you're seeing negative markets in that? Martin Parrish : I think it's going to chop around some, but we think overall it will be positive with our fleet. Joseph Gorder : And it's positive today, yes. Mohit Bhardwaj : And you guys mentioned crude-by-rail to California, it looks [indiscernible]. Is Port Arthur and St. Charles will be utilizing the rail side or you guys have just been looking at getting heavy cars from Latin America. Richard Lashway : So your question is -- can you restate your question? Mohit Bhardwaj : I was just wondering if economics for crude-by-rail into Port Arthur and St. Charles for heavy Canadian are still working out or is it more profitability to just look for opportunities for Latin American heavy metals right now. Richard Lashway : So I would tell you today that barrels that we're bringing to Port Arthur with today's economics would be breakeven versus on my alternative with where the market is today. Mohit Bhardwaj : And final one from me, just looking at California, the American [indiscernible] and talk about California models improving for them. And California remains the only place where the market has got a lot [indiscernible] value. Are there opportunities as you see to improve margins there? Joseph Gorder : To improve margins in California? Lane Riggs : The only project that we're working on really besides our ongoing optimization efforts, and maybe a real small thing is the crude-by-rail. We believe in the optionality available for us crude from the Mid-Continent ultimately, and because our views, the West Coast is a very challenging environment. We are very careful and very disciplined in how we approach capital into the West Coast versus all our opportunities we have elsewhere in our operations. Operator : The next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Ed Westlake : Congratulations on the earnings. I guess, last year we were talking about LLS, and this year we're just talking about all round good performance and margin capture, so well done. One of the, I guess, opening comments you made was, it was attributable to great performance from the hydrocrackers. Obviously, oil has fallen further and that's just sort of a swirl, and then obviously mentioned that diesel demand is a bit weaker, partly due to weather. I mean, presumably some of that will give back, although obviously take the point that the crude market part of it could still be an area of positive surprise. Just some thoughts there. Lane Riggs : We have a pretty good slide in our IR presentation on how the hydrocracker performed and sensitivities around it. We have sort of basic set of economics on the 2014 price stat. With that said, yes, oil price have fallen and the distillate crack is where it is, but natural gas prices have fallen as well. But I think when you look at it, when you look at these drivers, you just need to take all that in consideration. Today, we still have very good margins on the hydrocrackers. Ed Westlake : And was there any wholesale benefit? I mean, obviously, I guess racks in 4Q crude could fell? Lane Riggs : Yes. We did see a benefit on the wholesale side. The rack prices tend to lag a little bit. And so we had very good rack margins through the fourth quarter. Ed Westlake : I mean is there a way to quantify in dollar millions, I mean just obviously trying to get to sort of a sense of a more steady state level of earnings, appreciate there's lots of volatility in the fourth quarter and still today? Lane Riggs : I don't have those numbers. Ed Westlake : Any volumes of wholesale products, which perhaps because that stuff which you can sell over the rack where the wholesale margin may not have expanded as much, and then there are other parts to be U.S., I'm thinking, some of these states which don't have refining, where you'd imagine that there would be a greater sensitivity to wholesale. I mean any sort of overall number for production that is sold in rack prices, which is a price to the positive? Joseph Gorder : Well, I mean our wholesale business really consist of I would say several different types of businesses. We've got the branded wholesale business. We've got the unbranded contract business. We've got our national accounts business. And then we've got spot wholesale business. And all of that is volume that's moved across the rack. Ed, we don't have a problem talking about it, but quite honestly the income associated with the wholesale business is embedded right now in the way we report our refinery operations. And the volume and the margins on the wholesale business are so much smaller than we would have, if you look at the refining margin, it's just doesn't makes sense to break it out before. And it also tends to vary so much. So I would tell you, if you want we can talk about this a little bit offline, but I don't think it's going to have a material impact to your forecasting going forward. Ed Westlake : I was just trying to check, when you have surprises like this, you're trying to work out where they came from? Joseph Gorder : Sure. I understand, but I would tell you that maybe it was a good quarter for wholesale, but it wasn't something that material affected the numbers that we reported. Ed Westlake : And then just a tad theory of mine. We're all driving F150s to Disney World this summer. I'm driving from New York it's a long way, I might even take the F350 on the road. How do you think the industry is going to be prepared to make the summer-grade gasoline given that we probably haven't have this type of market for sometime. Maybe just give us a color on any constraints that you see in making summer-grade gasoline or not, just a view? Joseph Gorder : I don't see any thing where I would tell you that we'll have any constraints on being able to produce the gasoline for the summer time market. Ed Westlake : So it should just be a normal seasonal trade as we switch out from winter to summer, but nothing exceptional in your view? Joseph Gorder : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Joe, just as a follow-up from a conversation of couple of months ago, obviously Brent TI is tighter. So we're inside this export arbitrage, but now in 2015 the politics Washington are a little bit different. Wanted to get your temperature on the discussion around the crude export band and what discussions in Washington feel like around that right now? Joseph Gorder : That's a good question. I mean we maintain our position that we're totally supportive of free and open markets. If the crude export ban were lifted, we believe that Congress is going to address this and needs to address it, and the other issues associated with this as well such as the Jones Act, cross-border pipelines in the RFS, that's been our position and I think that we continue to believe that. It's hard to pick one particular issue and focus attention on that without looking at the overall energy policy that we have here in the U.S. in aggregate. So we talked to our government relations guys all the time. We know that there is a lot of conversation taking place around crude oil exports, but we're not seeing it being promoted in any kind of material way at this point in time. Now, if you go to the practical side of this, we are still importers of crude in the United States. We import significant volumes, probably still 4.5 millions barrels per day, and that's not from Canada. There is additional volumes that are coming from Canada. So you've got crude that's being brought into the country. You've got at market right now that is putting downward pressure on crude prices, and you ultimately will get to who's got the lowest cost to produce to determine who is going to be continuing to produce and provide the supply. So I, honestly, am not sure where you would see domestically produced crude being exported today as it's trying to find its way through refining capacity globally. So issues flare up and then they tend to calm down a little bit. This one is still getting some conversations, but I don't think our perspective has changed from what we've talked about historically. Neil Mehta : The other question is around Brent WTI just separately. You made the comment that you think they has the potential to widen out here over the next couple of months. What's driven the widening over the last couple of weeks? What do you guys see in Cushing happening? And then as you think about where that widening could occur, is it on the TI LLS piece of the equation or is it Brent LLS? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I would say the team has driven the Brent TI wide, as if you look at the DOE stats over the last two weeks, we had two very large crude bills. So it kind of starts to tell you that as the Saudi start forcing more medium sour barrels into the market, it displays that some of this like light sweetening will begin to light sweet. And as inventory is build then it means we need to wider for EIR in order to start the incentiving refineries to take that light barrel back into the market. So I think that's what's happened. I do think it will get wider to the point where we are incentivized to go back to light sweet. And I would tell you that I would expect that the Brent TI could be a little bit wider and part of that is also due to the fact that we're building all this inventory in Cushing, and so maybe the Brent TI is a little bit wider than the LLS to Brent Spread. Operator : The next question comes Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi Chow : Just a couple of follow-ups there. I guess this is a really question for the second half of year. With the Line 9 reversal, what sort of volumes do you have committed on that line and what sorts of crudes are you expecting to move on? Is it Bakken or Syncrude or some other Canadian barrel? Joseph Gorder : So I don't think we've talked about our line commitment is. What we've said is when Line 9 comes up, we'll be able to completely supply the Quebec refinery with North American domestic barrels. In terms of the quality of crude, we would expect to ship. About 50% of the volume we ship would be a synthetic-type barrel and the other mix of other Canadian light sweet Bakken. Chi Chow : And do those crudes, when you bring them in, are they going to change the yield at all or are they going increase the possibility from product standpoint on yields and volumes. Joseph Gorder : So what we would say is with the change in diet, the crudes that we anticipate getting off Line 9 tend to be a higher distillate yield crude. And so we do show that they have a margin advantage as long as distillate is over gasoline compared to some of the West African grades that we run today, which tend to be a higher gasoline yield crude. Chi Chow : And then a couple of questions just for Mike. I guess, you've got to couple of debt maturities this year, what's the timing of those? And secondly, how do you think about sort of a minimum cash balance that you're comfortable operating at. Michael Ciskowski : The timings, there's 400 is due next week. I believe it is. And then we have 75 that's couple of months later is on the timing. And what was the second question? Chi Chow : Just how you think about minimum cash balance? What sort of minimum levels are you comfortable operating at? Michael Ciskowski : I mean we really don't have a minimum cash balance identified, but when you look at our operations, I think, we are comfortable in the range of around $2 billion. End of Q& A Operator : At this moment, we show no further questions. I will like to turn the meeting over to you for any closing remarks. Joseph Gorder : Thank you, Hilda. We appreciate everyone calling in and those listening today. If you have additional questions please contact our IR department. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Christine and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to John Locke. You may begin. John Locke : Thank you, Christine. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now I will turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Well thanks, John and good morning everyone. As John will cover in more detail shortly, we reported record first quarter earnings per share. With great performance in a favorable margin environment we demonstrated Valero's earnings power in a heavy maintenance period. The one thing that I'd like to reaffirm with you before we proceed is that our team remains focused on executing our strategies to improve our valuation through operations excellence, optimizing our business through disciplined capital allocation and unlocking asset value. With that John I'll hand it back over to you. John Locke : Okay, great thank you Joe. What we like to do now is highlight a few accomplishments this quarter, that aligned with our key strategies and then we\u2019ll cover the quarterly results. As noted in the release our focus on operations excellence yielded solid results while we successfully managed the heavy turnaround season in the first quarter. For the remainder of 2015 we have a lighter schedule of planned maintenance compared to the first quarter. We remain committed to deliver a payout ratio of earnings to our stockholders that exceeds 2014's ratio at 50%. So far we are on track to meet this goal with a 55% payout ratio on first quarter of 2015 earnings. Regarding capital investments, we continue to optimize and improve our business while maintaining rigor in our capital budget. For 2015 we maintained our guidance for capital spending, including turnarounds and catalysts at approximately $2.65 billion which excludes a $150 million for a St. Charles Methanol project. The proposed St. Charles Methanol project and Houston alkylation units remain under valuation and are progressing through our gaited project management process. We expect to make final investment decisions on these projects later in the second quarter. With respect to unlocking asset value and accelerating the growth of Valero Energy Partners LP, which is our sponsored Master Limited Partnership, we are clearly delivering growth and have a backlog of assets to dropdown. Given the closing of the $671 million dropdown of our Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services business in March we\u2019re on track to complete our goal of $1 billion of dropdown transactions in 2015. Now moving on to the quarterly results we reported net income from continuing operations of $964 million or $1.87 per share for the first quarter of 2015. Earnings per share was 21% higher than first quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.54. The refining segment reported first quarter 2015 operating income of $1.6 billion versus $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2014. We covered the key drivers of this increase in the release but I'd like to highlight that while discounts were more narrow this quarter for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil on a dollar per barrel basis. On a percentage discount basis these crude were priced more favorably in 2015. For example, in the first quarter of 2015 my [ph] priced on average at a 20% discount to Brent versus a 17% discount in the first quarter of 2014. Our significant crude side flexibility allows us to adjust feedstocks and optimize margins based on the discount environment. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.7 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2015, which is an increase of 9,000 barrels per day versus the first quarter of 2014. Volumes and utilization rates in both periods were impacted by heavy plant maintenance. Refining cash operating expenses were $3.95 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 or $0.04 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2014. That\u2019s our 12th consecutive quarter with cash operating expenses below $4 per barrel. Our focus on safe and reliable operations, combined with advanced domestic energy costs provide us a global manufacturing competitive advantage. The ethanol segment generated $12 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2015 versus $243 million in the first quarter of 2014. While Ethanol margins compressed in the first quarter of 2015 they have rebounded some here in April. Longer term we believe Ethanol remains a key component of the transportation fuel mix. General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $147 million in the first quarter of 2015, which is $13 million lower than the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to changes in legal reserves. Also in the first quarter of 2015, net interest expense was $101 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $441 million. The effective tax rate was 31.7%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end total debt was $7.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.9 billion of which $28 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net [ph] of $2 billion in cash was 20.3%.Valero had over $10 billion of available liquidity including cash. Cash flows in the first quarter included $698 million in capital spending, of which $240 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. We also issued $1.45 billion of debt which included $1.25 billion of bonds in March for general corporate purposes, including the refinancing of current maturities and $200 million issued by VLP to partially fund their March acquisition. We returned $531 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $206 million in dividend payments and $325 million for purchase of 5.4 million shares of Valero common stock. Year-to-date we have purchased 7.1 million shares for $429 million. Now for modeling our second quarter operations we expect throughput volumes to fall in the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.55 million to 1.6 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 280,000 to 300,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 460,000 to 480,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be around $3.90 per barrel. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.7 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expense, excluding corporate depreciation for the second quarter to be around $175 million and net interest expense should be about $105 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $445 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 33%. Christine, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment we will open the call to questions. During this segment we ask that our callers limit each turn to only two questions. Callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions as time permits. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Evan Calio : Good morning guys. My first question relates to cash distributions and unlocking value, cash returns averaging 7% yield year-to-date, you also built a billion in cash in the quarter, you\u2019re now through the low end of your leverage guidance of 20% to 30%. I know you mentioned target payout ratio, how do you determine the optimal cash positions that continues to build and determine when to increase distributions from current rates? Michael Ciskowski : Evan this is Mike. I do not have a precise number I can give you but what I can give you is that in our debt to cap ratio guidance, we reduced our debt by $2 billion [ph]. From there we would like to keep some cushion in our cash balance given the volatility of our business. And then we look at the future capital and working capital requirement and then the payout of greater than 50% that we\u2019ve already committed to you guys. But I would like to point out that excluding the debt issue that we had in the first quarter we actually had a decrease in cash about $300 million. Evan Calio : Right, as you say, there\u2019s upside scope I guess from a $5 billion cash position to distribution, I guess would be my question. Michael Ciskowski : Yeah, I mean I would just to add further, we had committed to the greater than 50% payout. As we move through the year and if burning some cash flow continue positive where they are we will assess this and consider increasing that payout number. Go ahead. Evan Calio : Yeah understood, that makes sense. And then my second question in more on the product demand side and global credit spreads have been higher than expected year-to-date, global demand estimates continue to rise in response to low commodity prices. So is there any comments kind of what you\u2019re seeing through the system on demand trends and what you might expect for summer driving season we may not have seen in quite some time? Thanks. Gary Simmons : Yeah, Evan this is Gary, I think definitely we\u2019ve been in a good credit spread environment. I would say early in the year it was probably driven from, we had some heavy turnaround maintenance, we find return on maintenance and that type of activity. Also I think the U.S.W Union negotiation came into the play then supported the credit spread. That\u2019s kind of behind it now and I think really the market is being driven up by demand. We\u2019ve seen some pretty encouraging numbers thus far. We expect that, that trend will continue but I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell what\u2019s the magnitude of the demand response will be to the credit price. Evan Calio : Fair enough guys, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning. Neil Mehta : So my first question is just thoughts on spreads and particular Brent oil last which Brent WTI is healthy right now, LOS Brent looks little bit tighter, just any thoughts there in potential bottlenecks between Houston and St. James? Gary Simmons : Yeah, this is Gary again. I think the LOS to Brent spread has been a little bit narrow than what we would expect. I think ultimately the Gulf Coast Sweet market has the price at the level that allows the East Coast refiners to be able to receive domestic light sweet crude by [indiscernible]. So that kind is healthy overtime that LOS should be around $2 discount to Brent as long as the standard transportation differentials are going to hold. I think on what you\u2019re seeing today is the Houston market is bottlenecked with logistics getting the paid gains [ph] and so we\u2019re seeing Houston trade at much wider discounts to St. James than where it had been and so that\u2019s going ahead, [indiscernible] that economics to hold but they\u2019re right kind of breakeven and I would expect LOS to come off. Neil Mehta : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful and then on RINS, just any thoughts as we get into the second quarter here on where RINS prices are and how we should assess the impact on a go forward basis? Martin Parrish : This is Martin Parrish. So we think the RINS are just where they are, just waiting on the EPA announcement in June and just the uncertainty even though the EPA set it at the levels as everybody just waiting to see. So I think after June we'll see what happens then. Neil Mehta : All right, very good. Thank you very much guys and talk soon. Joe Gorder : Thanks Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Edward Westlake : Yes, good morning and I guess the first question still on the macro side. We are seeing a decent tanker [indiscernible] still from the Gulf of - Saudi are still pumping. I mean you drilled Mexico and Venezuela how would you characterize at the moment supply availability of water borne mediums inside into the system. Gary Simmons : I feel very good. Like you said we actually in the first quarter ran more South American crudes than what we've historically run. The Saudi are committed to the U.S. market. So I don't know that we'll go back to levels of imports that we saw three years ago. But I definitely think that volumes into the US Gulf will be up from what we saw last year. We're seen a lot more heavy Canadian than historical. So overall the Gulf Coast seems well supplied with all grades crudes. Edward Westlake : Right, okay. And on the VLP, I mean obviously a great - in March, a $1 billion, clearly very easy to achieve. Any view of going faster or you just hoping that $1 billion which is obviously a still healthy pace is the right pace going forward. Joe Gorder : No, and this is Joe. And we're very comfortable with the $1 billion pace this year and so that would imply that we're going execute another drop sometime in the second half of the year, probably later in the second half of the year. But what our real focus is, is on the distribution increase and we're committed to growing into that 25% plus this year for the next couple of years. So we're very comfortable with the pace we've got right now. Edward Westlake : Okay, thanks very much Joe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Hey guys good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi Paul. Paul Cheng : Joe, couple of years I think the company when looking at California has always said is not really a core for the long haul, and you're looking for, if someone give you a okay price that you would sell, is there any change in the view from management about how you look at California from a long-term standpoint. And if it is now part of your long-term portfolio? Is there any initiative for you that you're picking to improve the result relative to your key value seems to be lacking in there? Joe Gorder : Yeah, well Paul we've said this before that on the west coast we have very good assets and we have very good management teams operating those assets. And frankly we view our portfolio on the west coast as an option when the margins are strong on the west coast. And certainly we're experiencing that today and we had a very good first quarter. If you don't mind Paul what I'll do is let Lane just speak to our capital approach to the west coast. Lane Riggs : Hey Paul it's Lane. We just continue to be very disciplined in our capital. We look for small opportunistic enterprise to improve margin capture but we in, terms of like any major capital program we - in the event that we spend much money we have better opportunities in our Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent. So I would say though one of the things you'll see in terms of our margin capture because we need to make so much gasoline you'll see our capture versus an index probably got better. The first quarter is really a story of on the west coast to the west coast gasoline fracs. Paul Cheng : The second question, Mike going back into the cash position, is there a lag or you can share what is the comfort level of the cash that you want to hold? Michael Ciskowski : Well, I don't really have guidance for you on like a minimum cash balance but you can start with the $2 billion that we use in our debt calculation. And then we would like to keep some cushion in that given the volatility of our business. Paul Cheng : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chi Chow of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Chi Chow : Hey, thanks, good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning Chi. Chi Chow : I have a couple of questions on the North Atlantic market. You've realized strong double digit margins in that region for two quarters running now. Tad one [ph] and European cracks been pretty robust over this period. What do you think is the sustainability of those tighter product markets in that Atlantic Basin region? Gary Simmons : Well, I think there is a number of reasons for what we have seen in the first quarter and I think some of it is sustainable, you know obviously we had strong turnaround maintenance in that area as well, colder weather helped - always helped with demand but I think you are seeing good demand response in a lower crack price which is certainly constructive moving forward. I think the other thing that is happening the U.S. dollar strength versus the Europe it helped us with our operating costs, it is and - Pembroke as well. So I think there is a lot of encouraging signs on it. Joe Gorder : This is Joe, the one thing I would add to Gary\u2019s point, which are all correct is that the Pembroke asset is a very good asset and what we acquired when we bought that refinery was an integrated system. So when you think about merchant refining in Europe you really shouldn\u2019t think about Pembroke in that regard. The distillate barrels that we produce are moved in inland and certainly a significant volume of the gasoline moves inland. So it is a little bit difference set-up than some might be experiencing. Chi Chow : Are you concerned about distillate crack spud weakness going forward with all the global capacity that\u2019s come online over the year, last year or so. Joe Gorder : I would say we are not that concerned about the distillate cracks in our system. I think there is a couple of things, the U.S. market has been so strong we still see good export demand. However, we have been somewhat priced out of the market because our market has been so strong. So I think we think moving forward we will see a combination of a better demand domestically and we will see that our export volumes will pick-up again as the U.S. market falls off a little bit. Chi Chow : What were your export volumes for the quarter on gas and diesel? Joe Gorder : It is our gasoline was down a little bit at 94,000 barrels a day. The reason for that was really just because of the strength in the U.S. market. You know again this is an optimization for us and we would kind of say the way we optimize that it is more demand push rather than supply push and the export markets really weren\u2019t strong in on gasoline to pull the barrels away from goal. Our distillate volume were fairly flat about 205,000 barrels a day ULSD. If you look at the ULSD plus kerosene we were up, 255,000 [ph] barrels a day, so fairly consistent there. The change we saw for a lot of the first quarter in Europe was in open, so we are usually 64 between Latin America and Europe 70% of our volume actually went to Latin America and we did see that for the Europe that we predict foreseeing. Chi Chow : And one more question on the North Atlantic, can you talk how the 9 million [ph] reversal is going to impact your crude sourcing options going forward? Michael Ciskowski : Yes, I will give you little update on that you know we are still waiting for regulatory approval on land from the National Energy Board in Canada. We don\u2019t know the timeline on that. We feel like there is a good chance the NEB could approve that by mid-May. With a mid-May approval that would mean we really won\u2019t see any impact from line 9 in the second quarter. But we are optimistic we will start to receive oil in the third quarter, gives us a lot more flexibility in Quebec to be able to have the access to those Western Canadian and Bakken grades and not just relay on rail and U.S. Gulf Coast sourced barrels. Chi Chow : Okay, thanks. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd : Okay, thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Maybe if I could follow-up first with a follow-up question on VLP, is there earlier we talked about the potential for any evaluation of the wholesale fuel distribution EBITDA as a potential to drop the VLP. Maybe can you talk a little bit about whether that has done evaluation and any rough guidance to what that figure might look like? Michael Ciskowski : Yeah, Ryan this is Mike again. You know we are still evaluating that in the appropriate structure that we would consider to drop in the MLP. So I do not have a number that I can give to you on this call. Ryan Todd : Okay, great. I appreciate and then maybe just a general I mean we see the margin on the screen which looks supportive. But can you give us maybe just an update on what you are seeing a month in the second quarter in terms of the general operating environment? Michael Ciskowski : Yes, I think we are - the cracks continue to be strong and we continue to see good discounts on the crude. The big change probably has been in the crude market, some of the discounts could commence and we're run the lot more light sweet crude in our system today than what we did in the first quarter. But again I think we're seeing good demands both in the export markets and domestic demands. And so feel very encouraged about the profitability moving forward. Ryan Todd : Okay great, thanks. I appreciate it. Joe Gorder : Thanks Ryan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Dietert of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead. Jeff Dietert : Good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning Jeff. Jeff Dietert : I had a strategic question. I think historically Valero\u2019s been a little bit more of a refining pure play relative to some of the peer strategies that have been more integrated. You guys have sold off NuStar interest in Corner Store. And I was just hoping for an update on now Valero strategy is evolving going forward. What do you think about integration through the value chain do you expect a materially larger mid-stream business. Joe Gorder : Jeff that's a good question. I mean very clearly we are fuels manufacturing company. And certainly that involves refining it also involves our renewable fuels business. So that is it is such a significant part of the portfolio today to see any significant shift from that it just really - is not in the cards now. To answer your question on the mid-stream business. I do think we're going to see our midstream business expands significantly over the next several years. And as we've said our strategy in mid-stream is really to develop projects and acquire assets that are supportive of Valero's core businesses and I think if you look at the investments that we've made to date it would certainly support that. That being said the refining portfolio is large enough and the renewables portfolio is large enough that it provides plenty of opportunity for growth within that midstream business. I don't think you should expect us though to be looking upstream from where we are today in any material way or significantly downstream from where we are today. Although opportunities present themselves and you look at it but certainly that's not part of our plan today. Jeff Dietert : Thank you and secondly, looking through your refinery throughput guidance for the second quarter, it looked relatively conservative and my question is what are the LPs suggesting that you should max run, under what conditions would you run more aggressively or perhaps less aggressively. Michael Ciskowski : I think in terms of throughput probably be the biggest thing. And change as we see a pretty good rate level on some of our plants depending on if we're maximizing heavy sour versus light sweet especially like at $4 Jeff. It can change our throughput significantly when we start maximizing light sweet over heavy sour. I would say that was the only thing I can speak. Jeff Dietert : Thanks for your comments. Joe Gorder : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brad Heffern : Good morning everyone. Joe Gorder : Good morning. Brad Heffern : So just following up on the couple of previous answers looking for a little more color. I think in the first quarter you all talked about just the sheer number of water borne that were trying to find their way into the Valero system. Is the fact that you're running less water borne now and more domestic suggest that maybe the global crude environment is and is oversupplied as it was a few months ago. Michael Ciskowski : I think there has been a couple of events that are kind a driving the crude differentials. First, the medium seller market in the Gulf due to the market structure a lot of people were pulling their barrels off the market trying to hold them in collective role. So it kind of tightened up the medium sours. Now the storage is getting full. You also have some turnaround maintenance going on to the Deepwater pipe ones in the Gulf that's kind of also tightening the market a little bit. And then the heavy sour side in the Myer [ph] of course you had the buyer on the platform in Mexico which has also disrupted production there. So as my view is that these crudes as they compete with the light sweet we'll see the differentials come back as we move in the second quarter. Brad Heffern : And okay that's great color. And then maybe for Joe, a lot of E&P's have seem pretty confidence of way that the crude export ban is going to be lifted in the near term maybe in 2015. Do you have any updated thoughts or anything you've been hearing about that. Joe Gorder : Well I think we're probably hearing the same thing that you're hearing and we know that there is activity in the house and decided to bring the issue forward. But certainly the administration does doesn\u2019t seem at all receptive to this. Anyhow just to be clear on our position we believe in free and open market. As we talked about many times there\u2019s currently legislation and regulation in place that hinders the petroleum markets from being free and open and these for the included things like the crude export ban, RFS, the Jones and others. So we believe that looking at a specific issue relative to that overall issue is just not the right way to deal with this topic and you need to deal with all of the issues. One thing about Valero is that we\u2019ve continued to invest and we\u2019re running significant quantities of domestic crude today and we continue to invest to enable us to run more of this crude. So we\u2019re doing what we can to process it as are many other refiners. And then really the last point on this is when you look at the general need for crude exports the U.S. remains a net importer of crude oil with about 7 million barrels per day coming in we certainly export much lower volumes than that. So the question becomes do you really need the export and I think that\u2019s the question on everybody\u2019s mind. Brad Heffern : Okay, great that\u2019s it from me, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Thanks good morning everyone. Morning Joe. Joe Gorder : Morning Doug. Doug Leggate : If I could follow up on the last question on exports Joe from what we\u2019re seeing it looks like light sweet imports from Middle East in particular, looking at Kuwait in particular this is one example, they actually seem kind of increasing I'm just curious as to what is your strategy around accessing light sweet or just generally crudes outside of the U.S. and how do you think that impacts the crude export to-date? I think that\u2019s one of the key issues as the net balance as opposed to just the issue itself? Joe Gorder : Sure Doug, I\u2019ll let Gary, if you don\u2019t mind we\u2019ll let Gary speak to the imports. Gary Simmons : Yes, so Doug I would tell that primarily what we see from Kuwait is really not light sweet is more medium sour barrels and I would tell you that we have had many discussions with them and they seem interested on maintaining or actually growing market share in the U.S. on that grades of crude and the light sweet what we see happened is with all this volatility in the Brent TI moving in and out when the order comes in very narrow then we start to see incentives to import light sweet. In the first quarter we definitely saw that and as I\u2019ve discussed in the past the first place we generally see is at Kuwait and there were certainly times during the first quarter where the Brent TI got narrow and that incentivized to step back in and buy Brent related West African type crudes. Doug Leggate : Okay I appreciate the answer. Obviously we\u2019re watching this one closely, but my follow up Joe is really on the return of cash to shareholders and it\u2019s obviously the share price I guess like all other financial have done well from a lot of this trend in the first quarter and I think you said you guys said yourself in the prepared remarks the business is obviously volatile. When you think about the last time your predecessor had a very substantial share buyback program and where are the share prices now in the flight to Euro again embarking on a very substantial share buyback program how do you think about balancing the timing and I guess the balance between dividends and other methods of returning cash as opposed to just right buying back stock at current levels and I\u2019ll leave there, thanks. Joe Gorder : All right Doug I\u2019ll speak to it briefly and see if Mike has anything to add but the timing of the market is something that is almost impossible to do, right. I think the particular transaction you\u2019re referring to might have been the accelerated share repurchase that we executed some years ago and we don\u2019t have plans to do that. Now I don\u2019t want to get into being specific about our strategies around share repurchases other than that we\u2019ve committed to this greater than 50% payout ratio which we said would be a blend of repurchases and the dividend. We had a significant increase in the dividend at the end of January and we continue to look at cash and how we\u2019re going to employ it. What the capital budget is very manageable in the current context so I think if you said what are your plans are I think our plan is to continue to buyback share certainly to meet that greater than 50% target. Mike is there anything that you? Michael Ciskowski : I think that\u2019s well said. Joe Gorder : Okay. Doug Leggate : Thanks a lot everyone. Joe Gorder : All right Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Gresh : Hi good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning Phil. Phil Gresh : First question just on the midstream M&A potential. Appreciate the color you've given already just a follow up, would you rather have more EBITDA drop at this point before you consider midstream M&A at VLP. Are you comfortable within out of EBITDA there already and to extent that you would consider midstream M&A would you likely or do have developed any other Valero level given the cash that you have available right now. Michael Ciskowski : Phil, this is Mike. I think at this point in VLP stage they've probably would prefer to do the drops and get a little bit more sizable before they start taking on third party acquisitions. As you know the drops come with the minimum volume commitments they you may not all even get in the third party deal, depending on the deal so given their size I would say the drops are the more likely have that they will go. Phil Gresh : Got it okay. And just one final question the export ban. I guess the question is really like if you think about the ban being lifted if it were to happen. Would this materially change how you manage your business whether its growth projects or refine your logistics potential M&A aspirations just generally how do you think about the way you're managing your business today versus in that kind of a world and how you think about crude differentials. Joe Gorder : Well Just I'll fly over this and then let Gary speak to it if he would like to also our strategy is to optimize our operations. And that is a broad statement I know when it goes to our crude and feedstock slate it goes to our disposition of our products and it goes to our capital investments. And so I think what you would see certainly there is nothing that we're doing today that I would say we need to change in a crude export environment. We'll have to see what the market does and how the market will respond to that. I mean I guess you're pushing you'll be pushing additional crude barrels into the markets that seems to be well supplied today. And so the question are might this how the market is going to react to that and honestly if I don't think we're smart enough to tell you what that will be. Gary you\u2026? Gary Simmons : No, I agree. I think overall even if the export ban is lifted we would continue to have a location advantage running the domestic crudes. We continue to have significant operating costs advantage with the cheap natural gas. And then we're very happy with our portfolio of refining assets that are very complex very efficient refineries. Joe Gorder : And whether there is have a - material change on your real crude differentials? Gary Simmons : No, I don't think so I think overall the crude have to continue it compete or stays in refineries and so we're going to be the beneficiary in that. Phil Gresh : Okay great thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sam Margolin of Cowen. Please go ahead. Sam Margolin : Good morning. I wanted to ask you about the notes offering, familiar within the context of the gated process that you guys have talked about a lot. How was the pricing sort of relative to your expectations, did it change anything as far as return hurdles and maybe opening up some more capital intensive optimization plans or even or even on the M&A side? I mean it was a pretty in line with what you're expecting. Joe Gorder : Yes, the interest rates were well and pretty much where we expect for that offering coming at. I mean the funds will be used for general corporate purposes including the refinancing of our current maturities. I do not think that the issuance of that debt will increase any gated capital project or anything like that. It was just an opportunity to issue debt at low rate. Sam Margolin : Okay thanks a lot. And I don't think I heard you guys mentioned Methanol in the prepared remarks. So I'm assuming this question is again it gave any far. But I'll ask anyway. Is there anything incremental there to update us with there with or is it still just in the evaluative stages and or wait on the final decision. Lane Riggs : Hey Sam this is Lane so I'll just give a bit of an update. It's kind of where it's been. We anticipated our funding decisions here late in the second quarter. I'll just add any real consider this project going forward and our strategy we'd obviously more likely have a partner and we I would add that in terms of comment, that we're still on track to review this project here in the late second quarter. Sam Margolin : All right, perfect, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read : Good morning. Joe Gorder : Hello, Roger. Roger Read : Just wanted to follow-up, I guess, Jeff Dietert\u2019s question about potential higher throughputs and what signals maybe we need to look forward here either in terms of Brent LOS relationship or are there other sort of last mile pipeline issues in the Gulf Coast to think you hit you know higher throughput number in the second quarter here potentially hitting a higher number I would say. Joe Gorder : I don\u2019t really know what link come in the only thing I can think we are definitely signaling higher runs of light sweet crude which can have a late leverage at some of our heavy sour refiners but I don\u2019t know of anything else that would signal significantly different throughputs. Lane Riggs : No, right now our economic signals maximum throughput and Gary mentioned in the earlier answer there are obviously a rate thing that occurred in whether we were running light, medium or heavy sour crudes that obviously doesn\u2019t impact on our overall throughput. Roger Read : Okay, thanks. And then back to the OpEx initial comments mentioning under $4 for several quarters on a row here and then you know FX strength that helped out Pembroke. So could you kind of walk us through is there anything that you have operationally challenged and succeed or we are looking at you know it is cheap natural gas and it is an FX item flowing through this healthcare lower OpEx and I know throughput\u2019s being high also helps on a per barrel basis but if there is anything else you can offer that will be great. Lane Riggs : This is Lane. I want to say we are always vigilant on operating cost is our culture we work every day, every month, every hour, to make sure that we are busy maintaining our fixed and our structural operating it is into natural gas prices in the first quarter versus the fourth in last year throughputs were a little bit and so partially offset by that and we will absolutely maintain our focus volume and having lower operating cost. Roger Read : But nothing specifically you think about it is just general pressure on the system? Lane Riggs : No, no. Roger Read : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Blake Fernandez : Hi, guys, good morning. Two questions for you if I could; one, you mentioned in the press release the benefit of the secondary product pricing and I assume that is just kind of some spill over from the glut in crude prices but now that we are starting to see kind of reversal in the crude markets and moving higher. Are you starting to see a bit of a reversal on that secondary product pricing here into 2Q? Joe Gorder : Well I would definitely say that you know when you get out into the products other than gasoline [indiscernible] PATCO, LPG a lower slot price environment tend to have these products trade closer to group value and it helps track realization and as crude moves up and the reserve will also be true. Blake Fernandez : Okay. Gary, secondly just a follow-on for me previous exports commentary the shift that we have seen basically away from Europe. Can you just talk a little bit about the upper - needed there in other words to drive the economics to incentivize transport over to Europe is it basically like a $1, $2 a barrel that is needed and then maybe as a follow-on to that. Do you have any sense I know you mentioned indigenous demand growth here, but do you have any sense that maybe from European utilization rates moving up there or any of the new global facilities beginning to penetrate that market do you have any color there? I appreciate it, thanks. Gary Simmons : Yeah, I guess I will start with that. I think we just still feel like our traditional exports markets are there for us as long as it is economic for us to supply those markets and we have seen a move back to where we are Europe it is open you know it basically is just looking at the differences in the two markets, freight and then we are also taking to effect the RINS. And so the higher RINS prices that we are seeing today helps incentivize exports basically to Europe. So you know freight generally were lower $2 you know to get a barrel to Europe and the RINS in the 71 that range that kind of give you the differential that\u2019s needed to support exports. Blake Fernandez : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys, I have two quick follow-up. One, Joe can you give us or maybe this is for Lane, the [indiscernible] expansion are we done that, or that what is the schedule there? Lane Riggs : No, we\u2019re finished there, this is Lane by the way Paul, we finished that in the third quarter this year. Paul Cheng : All right. And maybe that this is for Gary. Gary, are you guys currently, given the current defense. Are you exporting crude oil from the Gulf Coast to Quebec? And that also after the Line 9 reversal complete do you still need to export from the Gulf Coast or that you will get sufficient Western Canadian crude into Quebec? Gary Simmons : Yes. Paul so we are exporting from the Gulf to Quebec in the first quarter little over a 70% of our diet was crude sourced from Canada and the US gulf and post Line 9 we would still anticipate that we would see some flow of oil from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Canada over the water. Paul Cheng : Can I ask a final question? Joe Gorder : Just for you Paul Cheng : Thank you. In the last two years when we look at from the first to the second quarter, your margin capture rate seems highest on an average drop by about 10%. Into the first quarter this year that do you have a far more heavy down time especially in the Gulf Coast and in the second quarter your - is going to be much higher. So should we still assume that your margin capture rate would be the pattern will be similar to the last two years that drop of roughly above 10% from the first quarter therefore or that it should deviate somewhat differently? Joe Gorder : Yeah, Paul so generally what would be happening in the transition for the first to second quarter you go through our VP [ph] transition on the gasoline and decrease ethane blending which drive down our crack repayment. You\u2019re correct that as we have lighter turnaround main region in the Gulf it should offset some of that where we come out I don\u2019t know but I\u2019ve to look at it. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Thanks Paul. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to John Locke. John Locke : Hey, great. Thanks Christine. We appreciate those who called in today and everyone listening. If you have additional questions please contact me or Karen in the IR department. Operator : Thank you. And thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Welcome to the Valero Energy Corporation reports 2015 second quarter earnings conference call. My name is Tiffany, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke. Mr. Locke, you may begin. John Locke - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Tiffany. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are : Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in our press release. In summary it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now I will turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks very much, John, and good morning, everyone. As John will cover in more detail shortly, our team operated our system safely, reliably, and efficiently during the second quarter, allowing us to capture a very high percentage of the favorable margins available to us. In particular, we saw market conditions that incentivized maximum gasoline production in most regions. As for our priorities, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to stockholders by exceeding our total payout guidance. As reflected in the earnings release, we've increased the targeted total payout ratio for 2015 to approximately 75% of net income. We continue to advance the next dropdown transaction to Valero Energy Partners LP, which is our sponsored MLP. We've also completed our estimate of potential MLP-eligible EBITDA within our fuels distribution business. In that regard, we've identified approximately $350 million that may be eligible for dropdown transactions to VLP, which is incremental to the approximately $800 million of remaining EBITDA that we've previously identified. And finally, in regard to the proposed methanol project at St. Charles, we plan to have a final investment decision by the end of the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our prior investments in hydrogen production capacity at the refinery provide us with a competitive advantage versus a greenfield methanol plant in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. So with that, John, I'll hand it back over to you. John Locke - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Great, thank you, Joe. Now moving on to the quarterly results, we reported net income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion or $2.66 per share versus second quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.22. The refining segment reported operating income of $2.2 billion, notwithstanding planned turnaround work on the FCC [Fluid Catalytic Cracking] and alky [alkylation] units at our Port Arthur refinery. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which is an increase of 87,000 barrels per day versus the second quarter of 2014. Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the second quarter of 2015. Refining cash operating expenses were $3.66 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015, or $0.24 per barrel lower than the second quarter of 2014. Lower energy costs, primarily due to lower natural gas prices and less planned and unplanned downtime, were the main drivers for the decrease. The ethanol segment generated $108 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2015 versus $187 million in the second quarter of 2014. General and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $178 million in the second quarter of 2015. Also in the second quarter of 2015, net interest expense was $113 million, which is $15 million higher than in the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to the debt issuance in March of this year. Depreciation and amortization expense was $425 million. The effective tax rate was 30.8%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $7.3 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.8 billion, of which $52 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was approximately 20%. Valero had over $5 billion of available liquidity excluding cash. Cash flows in the second quarter included $530 million of capital spending, of which $160 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. We also repaid $75 million of debt that matured in June. We returned $870 million in cash to our stockholders in the second quarter, which included $203 million in dividend payments and $667 million for the purchase of 11.3 million shares of Valero common stock. Year to date we've purchased 19.5 million shares for $1.2 billion. For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.57 million to 1.62 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 445,000 to 465,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 275,000 to 295,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 475,000 to 495,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be around $3.75 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expense excluding corporate depreciation for the third quarter to be around $180 million, and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $450 million. And our effective tax rate is expected to be around 33%. Lastly, following the EPA's announcement of proposed RFS [Renewable Fuel Standards] targets in late May and the subsequent decline in Ethanol RINs [Renewable Identification Numbers] prices, we expect 2015 RINs expense to be between $350 million and $450 million. Tiffany, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we will open the call to questions. During the Q&A, we ask that our callers please limit each turn to two questions. Callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions as time permits. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. And our first question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil, you may go ahead. Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Neil. Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Joe, we continue to see this tremendous bifurcation in the crack between gasoline and diesel. Is this the world that you envision here over the next couple months or even into 2016, where gasoline stays strong and diesel stays weak? And can you talk about the demand dynamics you're seeing from the product side between those two different categories? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet, Neil. It's probably best if Gary Simmons spoke to that. He's closest to the market. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Neil, I guess what I would say is we certainly expected some price demand elasticity for gasoline with the fall in flat price. And we've seen that, and we didn't really know exactly what the magnitude of the pent-up demand would be. And it's been a very pleasant surprise, and I think we do expect that that response will continue into the future. Overall, you talk about diesel margins being weak. Really diesel margins are about where they've been historically. It's just mainly the strength in gasoline. We would see that there would be some seasonality. As we get out of driving season, we would certainly expect some fall-off in gasoline demand. But as long as we see the lower prices, I think we expect the demand response to continue to be good. Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very good. And then the follow-up here is on the methanol project. Maybe I'm over-interpreting the remarks here, but it sounds like you're more constructive on a possible project. Can you talk through the pluses and minuses associated with methanol and just remind us of some of the project economics? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, we'll let Lane talk to this and then we'll all add. R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Neil, this is Lane. Just as a reminder on the fundamentals of that project, it's really a natural gas-to-liquids project. And we still have a long view that natural gas is going to be advantaged going forward, and it is one of the most economical ways to get natural gas into the liquids, crude-related pricing environment. We did review all of the way up through Gate 3. The project still looks good. But as we've mentioned in all of our Investor Relations meetings, where we are now is trying to get the right deal with a partner to make this a good deal for our shareholders, and that's what we're working on currently. And we expect to have some resolution on that by the end of this year or early first quarter. What else was it? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think that covers it. Neil, honestly, the project looks good and the guys have now identified what the capital might look like, and we're just working through the negotiations with a partner on what the transaction might look like. We consider having gas-to-liquids projects as good projects for us. We also consider that entering into what we would consider to a be a bit of a new line of business, it's always prudent to try to manage that risk and to look for opportunities not only to do a project like this but additional projects going forward. So again, we continue to advance it. I would tell you we feel pretty good about it. And if we can get the type of deal that we're looking for, I would suspect that we'd advance it. Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, Joe. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Paul, you may go ahead. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Paul. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Joe, one of your competitors recently did a deal using the high-currency MLP vehicle to buy another MLP, and the end result for the C-Corp has been quite excellent. And last year the other competitor of yours did something similar. So I know that you guys have been focusing on the dropdown. But given the success from your competitor, is that something that you guys will reconsider, maybe shifting the strategy a bit here or that you're going to stick with dropdown? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Paul, I didn't see the transaction that you're talking about. I'm teasing you. But I think, look, we've seen two transactions now take place like this. Let me start by saying we clearly understand the value of the general partnership and we understand the value of pushing to the high splits. That being said, we're very comfortable with the approach that we've taken thus far with our dropdowns. We'll execute the second dropdown transaction later this year, and I think that you could expect that going into next year that dropdowns will probably be accelerated somewhat further. But it's always a matter of opportunity and timing, and for us we don't believe that VLP currently is positioned to do a transaction similar to this on their own. They don't have their investment-grade rating. We're probably a year behind these others in getting an MLP into the marketplace. And so we believe that right now the most prudent thing to do is to execute the strategy that we've laid out, and then longer term we'll look for opportunities. And obviously, these deals seem to be a double-edged sword. They do create significant value at the C-Corp, but they've also had a fairly questionable effect on the LP. And so in a perfect world, we could get a transaction that would benefit both, but right now our focus is on continuing to do the dropdowns. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, second question. Maybe this is for you or for Simmons. There seems to be a tightness in the alkylate or the high-octane component in the market today, and I just want to see whether you guys agree with that assessment. And secondly that if it is, how do you think the impact on the industry gasoline supply as well as the gasoline crack? Thank you. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Yes, Paul, so this is Gary. We certainly do see that all heavy octane components are trading at a significant premium. I think there are several driving factors here that are causing that to occur. One, you have a very wide spread between naphtha and gasoline, so that's incentivizing people to try to blend naphtha into the gasoline pool. In order to make that happen, you have to have a high octane blend component. The second thing that's happened is there has been quite a bit of planned and unplanned maintenance on re-formers and Appalachian units throughout the industry. So some of it is supply-related. And then finally, some of these export markets, in particular Mexico, we're seeing a lot of good demand for Mexico for gasoline. And although the octane retirements in Mexico are comparable to what we have here in the U.S., they have an olefin spec on their gasoline, NPT and olefins, and that forces you to blend a lot more reformate and alkylate and less TET gasoline in order to sell your product into that market. So I think this is something that we see that will continue into the future. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Gary, can I ask a slightly somewhat different question? With the LLS mass discount we know with Maya is over $4 and LLS priced at $50, it seems like you guys must be printing money in processing the medium sour, and especially comparing to the Maya discount is not really attractive. So do you think that it will ultimately force the Maya discount to be wider now, or that you're actually going to see the mass discount narrow from here? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : I think we're into a period where the crude discounts will be very favorable for us in the third quarter. Yes, economically right now we're incentivized to maximize medium sours in our system. I think the hard thing to see when you talk about heavy sours is certainly we agree with your comment; Maya is not priced competitively today. When we roll to August, they have widened the K by another $1.50. And most of the heavy sours that we're buying are not off the Maya formula, which gives us a good incentive for those as well. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, Ed. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I think gasoline is going to be a seam \u2013 congrats on the results. I was just looking at a chart which showed that globally we're 2.5 million barrels a day more gasoline demand than we were before the financial crisis. So how possible is it do you think, and obviously specs have tightened as well around the world, particularly for summer grades. And how possible is it do you think that we just hit a tipping point and this could take some time to resolve? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : I think it will take some time to resolve. We're certainly running all of our gasoline producing units at max utilization. We've seen good utilization in Europe. And as you've mentioned, we're having trouble keeping up with gasoline inventories. So I think it will be here for an extended period. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Coming back then to the more strategic payout versus growth, obviously you've been very clear about what you're planning to do this year. Presumably with VLP also being a little bit, should we say, still needing to develop before you could do something maybe more strategic with that, you would continue to adopt that through into 2016 because obviously your guidance was very much this year. Maybe some broader comments about payout versus reinvesting for growth in the business. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, and so let's put VLP to the side for just a minute. But, Ed, we believe that growth and return of cash to shareholders aren't mutually exclusive, and I think that we've been demonstrating that. We've shared in our analyst presentations a definition of what we would consider to be discretionary and non-discretionary uses of cash, and we explained how we've created a competition within Valero for the use of that cash. And from a capital project perspective, it's largely based on the adequacy of the returns and then the timing to get the projects through our gated process to where we're looking at doing that. But I don't want \u2013 with our increase in the payout ratio, we view this as an opportunity to return what we would deem to be excess cash to shareholders. It's not at the expense of starving the organization of capital certainly for our maintenance projects but also for our growth strategy projects. We forget that we've got two crude units that we've spent somewhere around $800 million on excluding tanks and infrastructure to support those. Those two projects will be on the first part of next year. We've got investments that we made in Line 9 assets that are going to allow us to take that crude into the refineries, which will provide significant crude benefits for us. That hasn't shown up yet in the earnings because of course Line 9 isn't functioning yet. So we've got a lot of things we're doing to drive growth in the earnings of our business in addition to returning cash to shareholders. But as we've communicated clearly too, I think we're being very disciplined in our assessment and in our communications of our plans around these projects, and we'll continue to do that. It doesn't mean that Lane and his team aren't looking at a host of very interesting projects for the refining business, but they tend not to be of the order of magnitude like the hydrocracker projects. They tend to be smaller, higher returns, and projects that we can execute quicker. As we run them to ground, we'll be happy to share them. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks very much, very clear. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe. Paul, you may go ahead. Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Hi, everyone. Could you talk a little bit about the outlook for utilization in the back half of the year, turnaround season firstly for you guys to the extent that you're prepared to do that? And then if you've got any observations on how you see the industry running, that would be helpful. Thanks. R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Hey, Paul, this is Lane. So, we don't really provide forward-looking comments on our turnaround, but I will say I think you'll see a seasonal drop in utilization in the industry going into the late third and obviously the fourth quarter. But I do think you're going to see a pretty heavy turnaround season in the first and second quarter of next year. If you think back, we had the USW strikes, which caused many of our counterparts to delay much of their turnaround activity. So talking to our main contractors, we believe there's going to be a heavy turnaround season in the first half of next year. Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Interesting. Lane, while I've got you, could you talk a bit more about crude markets? Particularly, we've been consistently surprised this earnings season by the strength of U.S. oil production through Q2. And also I guess imports are high, and you've talked about some of the spreads that are attractive to you as regards imported barrels. How do you see the market playing out now? Do you get the sense that we are going to see a rollover in U.S. production or not? And also how sustainable do you think the import story is going to be? Thanks. R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Paul, I'm going to have defer to my esteemed colleague, Mr. Simmons, on that, so he'll answer that. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : I think we've been surprised with the decline in rig count, production still seems to be holding. I don't really know that I can give you much insight whether that will continue or not. I think what we're seeing in terms of the imports is just the volatility in the crude markets. The Brent/TI [WTI] spread comes in and incentivizes people to start importing foreign light sweet. As we talked about in the past, the first place we tend to do that is our Quebec refinery, which we did in the second quarter. In fact, the Brent/TI spread got narrow enough that we even took some foreign light sweet into St. James. You see that same dynamic hold on the medium sours. We maximize Mars and domestic medium sour production into our refineries. And then as the differentials come in, we actually brought in some Brazilian grades to compete with that when the markets get tight. So I think as long as you see this volatility, you'll continue to see windows where it supports imports of crudes into the market. Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Sure, and I've seen particularly that the foreign light sweet is basically just West African that bounces in and out depending on where the spreads are. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Primarily, yes. Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : When we go into turnaround season coming up and as distillate takes leadership in the market in general, I guess you'd be anticipating lower crude prices through Q3 and Q4 if we turn around \u2013 at least to this extent turn around the U.S. refining system. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Yes, I would suspect that that would happen. We're sitting on a pretty good overhang of crude oil inventory here in the U.S. We're 90 million barrels above where we were last year. So with that overhang and then heading into a typical maintenance period where refiner demand is down, you would think that that would have pressure on the price of crude oil. Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Just checking, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Evan, you may go ahead. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys, and I look forward to the VLP strategy evolution over time. My question is maybe a follow-up on the buyback. Given the cash position, especially with the dropdowns, and I know you raised that potential today, your net debt to cap is at 6%. Does that really imply that while active that you're pacing the buyback so you can continue at maybe a similar rate, even in the potentially seasonally weaker margins of other quarters, or really relate to some of the projects that you're maturing in your portfolio with the potential to change that CapEx outlook for 2016? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : When we look at our rate on our buybacks, this is Mike. We do look at our future capital and working capital requirements, and then also what we've committed to do to date. But we do realize that we had a great quarter. Our cash balance built despite doubling our buyback rate. So we will continue to look at these things as we move through the year. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And then, Evan, though, the tail on your question addressed 2016 CapEx. And we haven't gone through the process of reviewing 2016 details with the Board of Directors yet, so we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. But we don't see any material change to 2016's numbers. We've got good projects that have good returns, but as I mentioned, they tend to be much smaller. And we don't expect we're going to come out with a big huge capital number to drop on you. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, even with the methanol and/or alky unit proceeding? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Look, the methanol plant, as we've talked about, what we're really looking for in a partner there is somebody who's willing to put skin in the game along with us. And of course, we would view a significant part of our capital contribution to be the infrastructure and other assets that we're bringing to the table. So let's just assume that you're talking about a project that's somewhere around $900 million to begin with, and you ended up with a 50 :50 relationship, and part of our contribution to that is going to be what we have in place today. You're not talking about a significant amount of capital from Valero's perspective. We are willing to put some in, but I don't think it's going to exceed anything that we've shared with you. In fact, I'm certain it won't to date. That being said, that project somewhat hinges on our ability to get the kind of transaction that we're comfortable with, number one, that brings expertise to the table; and number two, provides a potential platform for us to do additional transactions down the road. So that's really our view on that. Do you guys want to speak to alky at all? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Yeah. Evan, this is Lane. So the alky is still in the gated process. It still looks okay. We're going to reach a funding decision, yes or no, somewhere in the first quarter of next year. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, that's good news, guys. And if I could just maybe get one follow-up as we're talking about capital projects, any detail on the McKee expansion startup and/or Line 9 in the back half the year? Thanks. R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Evan, this is Lane. I'll answer McKee and I'll let Gary answer Line 9. So McKee, we should have the projects entirely complete in September, and that's a plus 25,000 barrel per day crude throughput, so that's the status of that project. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : And on Line 9, Enbridge did get the approval to start up the pipeline from the National Energy Board, which was good news. However, they had a stipulation that they had to hydro-test three sections of the line. They have a plan to do that which has also been approved by the National Energy Board. It does require some permits that they don't have, and then we don't know what will happen with the hydro test. But for us, assuming everything goes well, there's a chance that Line 9 is operational by the end of the year. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good, thanks, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Evan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Dietert of Simmons. Jeff, you may go ahead. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jeff. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Could you talk about product exports for the quarter, especially I guess both gasoline and diesel, and what you're seeing in the international markets there? And perhaps talk about opportunities to sell gasoline out of the Gulf Coast into California as well. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Jeff, this is Gary. Our export volumes of gasoline were down a little bit in the second quarter, and it was primarily just due to the strength of the domestic markets. We exported 76,000 barrels a day of gasoline. Most all of that volume went to Mexico and Latin America. A small amount of it went to Eastern Canada. On the distillate side, we did 235,000 barrels per day of diesel; then we did another 45,000 barrels per day of jet kero. So total distillates were 280,000 barrels per day, most of that to Latin America. We also sent some of that to Europe. Over 60% of it was to Latin America though. As far as your question on Gulf Coast exports to the West Coast, in our system, mainly because of Jones Act 3, the way that optimization works is we generally supply West Coast barrels from our Pembroke refinery, and we did do that in the second quarter. Pembroke blended CARB [California Air Resources Board] gasoline, which we took to the West Coast. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Got you. And secondly, the industry is focused on distillate yield over time, with a historical growth rate that was more rapid for diesel than for gasoline. Recently, it seemed gasoline demand has been really strong. Can you talk about maybe some of the major drivers there and how sustainable you think that trend might be? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : I think that the big driver for gasoline demand has just been the lower flat price and demand elasticity and the response to the lower flat price. And so I think as long as we're in this lower price environment, we'll see good gasoline demand moving forward. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Got you. And finally, you've got the Houston-Appalachian unit projects that you've been talking about. And with the tightness in octane, do you see other projects developing to bring more octane into your portfolio? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Hey, this is Lane. The only thing we're really, we'll have to \u2013 obviously, our re-former margins are very wide. Naphtha is very discounted. We're focused on getting our re-forming unit capability tuned up. We've been working on it all summer to make sure that we are getting full utilization of our current assets. We don't have a whole lot of other, besides the alky, of projects in the pipeline to address the shortage on the octane side yet. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Okay, thanks for your comments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chi Chow of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. You may go ahead. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks a lot. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Chi. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi, Joe. How are you doing? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: It looks like you've had this structural uptick in margin capture in the North Atlantic region really over the last four quarters or so. Is this really the result of crude slate optimization at Quebec, or are there other factors contributing to that trend? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Chi, I would say that the biggest driving factor has certainly been that we're supplying the Quebec refinery with domestic crude from the U.S. Gulf Coast. Again, that's an economic optimization, but we've put our Corpus dock in place during the quarter, which gave us a further incentive to get those barrels to Quebec. In April, 95% of the barrels we ran in Quebec were domestic barrels, and I think that's been the biggest reason. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: And do you believe once Line 9 starts up, are you going to get another uptick in that capture rate just with the additional flexibility you've got with Line 9? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Yes, we certainly think that that will be the case. If you look at today's economics, a barrel off Line 9 into Quebec would have about a $3 a barrel margin advantage over something that we're sourcing from the Gulf Coast. So if this holds, it would be a fairly significant uplift. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good to hear, okay. And what's your outlook for refining dynamics in Europe going forward here for Pembroke? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Pembroke is a little bit unique, I would say, Chi, in that it's really satisfying that the domestic market in the UK with some export capability. So it tends to not be as exposed to import barrels, for example, as some of the other European refineries might be. But I think our view is the same. Longer term, Western Europe and the Med have probably the least competitive refineries out there. And as barrels move into those markets, they're going to be exposed. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: All right, okay, one final question here. In California, obviously, it's been a great environment out there this year. How do you see things playing out in the second half? Do you expect ongoing strong gasoline cracks there for the balance of the year? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Yes, it's difficult to predict. Certainly, as you know, as we head out of driving season, demand weakens a little bit, and then you get more butane blending into the pool. That will swell production some. So to me, a lot of what happens on the West Coast will be supply-driven. And some of these refinery outages that we've been seeing, will they continue or not will really determine how strong the West Coast market will be. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: But your plants are running well at this point out there? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Chi, this is Lane. I've got to knock on wood, they've been running very well. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: It shows up in the second quarter. Okay, thanks a lot. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. You may go ahead. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Faisel. How are you, Faisel? Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right, just a couple quick questions. First is just going back to some of the comments around your payout ratio, I just want to make sure I understand. So this year we're looking at a 75% payout ratio. And then just so I understand how that evolves as we go into next year, is it wait and see, or should we expect something similar in that range? I appreciate all the commentary around capital spending and everything. Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We're in the process of running I guess our strategic plan and budget for next year, and so we really haven't come up with guidance that we're prepared to give at this particular time. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, understood. Is it fair to say there's \u2013 is there something special about this year versus the forward years that makes the payout ratio 75% this year different than \u2013 I'm just trying to understand how you guys are philosophically looking at the outlook on this payout ratio. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Philosophically, we started the year saying we want to achieve a minimum 50% payout ratio. I think you could expect that if the business is performing, that would be a minimum that we'd like to live with going forward. You know the potential volatility in this business, and so what we have committed to is we've given you an indication of what we deem to be the minimum cash that we want to keep on the balance sheet. We've got a capital budget that's certainly under control and very manageable. And the other thing we can tell you is that we don't plan to raffle cash. So depending on the performance in the business, we would look at returning surplus cash flows to shareholders. That being said, there are other opportunities that may come up that from quarter to quarter we'd want to change that. But again, if you look at what we've said in the analyst presentations, we're committed to maintaining the assets. We're committed to the dividend. We will continue to look at the dividend going forward and make changes as we see fit. And then we're going to let the investment-grade rating overall govern it. So I think we're very comfortable taking this year's payout to 75%, and I think you could expect that we'll try to maintain a 50% level going forward. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's very clear, thank you. This is the last question. I believe you've received the last set of rail cars, the 5,300 you purchased. I'm trying to understand. How is that fleet being utilized now? I know the differentials have been pretty narrow. But I'm just trying to understand what the fleet utilization is given the current market situation. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : We certainly saw in the second quarter that we didn't have near the advantage to ship crude by rail that we have been seeing in the past. However, the differentials are coming back up, and so we see that we'll start ramping up volumes in our Lucas terminal. We're still taking volume to Memphis via rail, St. Charles as well. So we're utilizing the rail cars, and then some of the general purpose cars that we have we are going ahead and transitioning into our ethanol service. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Martin Parrish - Vice President- Alternative Fuels : And this is Martin Parrish. On the ethanol, we run at least 2,800 cars there routinely in that business. We don't see that changing, so we've got a lot of room there for rail cars. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great, thanks for the time, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Gresh of JPMorgan. Philip, you may go ahead. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning, so just one follow-up first on the distillate exports. Obviously, the trends have softened over in Asia in the past month or so. I was just wondering what you're seeing more recently relative to the 2Q trend and whether that distillate arb is still there for export. Just in general, what's going on? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : I think we're still seeing good demand in Latin America for the distillate exports. That's still there. The other big market for us, Europe, we've been hovering around breakeven, and it's still about there. The big thing that's impacting that is freight. So the freight has been varying anywhere from $0.07 to $0.11. And depending on freight, it means that the arb is either open or closed. I would tell you today it's about breakeven. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it, okay. And on the commentary about potentially accelerating drops, I'm curious how you're thinking about the capacity for drops right now. And if you accelerate it, how much more would you be able to do? How much could the market handle in your view? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It wasn't really commentary. It was just a comment. And I think that what we've done, this year we're going to end up slightly over our $1 billion. Next year I think we'll end up slightly over what we're doing this year. Your sense on how big that market is, is probably as good as our sense on how big that market is. But we think that we can execute the transactions and do the drops on the pace that we're thinking about without rattling the market. So, Rich, is there anything that you'd add to that? Richard F. Lashway - Director, President & Chief Operating Officer : No, I think that's the plan and to grow distributions in that targeted 25% range. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Phil, we just haven't wavered on that. And I don't know if you could hear Rich or not but the point was that we've still got the 25%-plus distribution growth as our target. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure, okay. And just to confirm on the buybacks that the buyback target is just as a percent of net income and you're going to also add in 100% of all dropped capital on top of that in terms of buybacks. I believe that's something you said in the past. I just wanted to confirm that? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Let me say what we've said in the past is 50% plus the cash proceeds for buybacks. So resetting the target to 75% of net income is now going to be 75% of net income. Mike, you want to elaborate on that? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, that's pretty much it. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So the drops, of course, and you know this, Phil. We haven't taken a lot of free cash in on these drops yet. And until VLP has access to the public markets, we'll probably continue to have a limited amount of cash that we get from VLP for the drops. So from our perspective, what we've done is just simplify the way to look at this, and we're saying it's 75% of net income. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, fair enough. And I guess to the extent that M&A opportunities do come up on the midstream side, and you've mentioned you'd rather wait a year to get investment-grade, et cetera. But if something comes up that is attractive to you, would you consider doing M&A at the Valero level for midstream and then dropping it down later, or is it more of a let's wait and see how it goes for the next year and not really looking at those sets of opportunities right now? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Would we consider doing an acquisition the Valero Energy level? Sure, we would look at that and compare that to our other uses of cash and make that decision, but we would consider it. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Phil, we're not opposed at all to acquisitions, and we tend to look at everything that's out there. And we're well positioned to do acquisitions, but we just haven't found one yet that we think adds value for Valero shareholders. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Fair enough. Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you, good morning, everybody. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Joe, periodically you've talked about whether the West Coast was strategic for Valero. And obviously, it's been \u2013 I guess with the Torrance situation in February that this sector has never really looked back against the strong gasoline demand. So I'm just curious. Does your view on the strategic importance of the West Coast change given recent events, or just update us on how you're thinking about that? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Doug, honestly, I think it's been in the past and it's really well in the past that we looked at potential dispositions around the West Coast. Subsequently, we've said that we view the West Coast as a great option. I think Lane has answered the question that even when margins were challenged out there, we were cash flow positive on the West Coast. We continue to monitor our investments out there so that we don't end up going cash flow negative, but it does provide a very interesting option for periods like this where we've got basically extraordinary cracks. And so I would tell you that this management team hasn't changed their perception, that we really like having the West Coast assets, which as Lane said, are running very well. They have strong management teams. We're very comfortable and pleased to have them as part of this asset portfolio. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, I appreciate the answer. Joe, my follow-up is really more really to get your sense as to what you're really seeing in this market currently. And really you've not made any secret of the fact that we all know this is a seasonal business and we've had a lot of extraordinary events this year, starting with Torrance, albeit against a backdrop of very strong demand. And I guess what I'm really getting at is that last year gasoline cracks were zero in December, and we're probably going to see 0.5 million barrel a day drop in demand in gasoline seasonally between now and the end of the year. So my question to you is do we see the typical rotation towards distillate given where distillate cracks are right now from yourselves and from your peers? And not so much from your peers but from yourselves as far as what your plan would be? If your LP is still telling you to max gasoline, do you keep running that until it flips even though the gasoline demand drops? Because obviously that's a harbinger for weaker gasoline cracks in the second half of the year. So we're all wrestling with this, obviously I just want to get your perspective as to how you're planning to run Valero's business if cracks remain at a significant premium for gasoline over diesel. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Gary, do you want to? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Yeah, so overall, the way our optimization works is it would be like you suggested. We would continue to maximize gasoline as long as the prompt market supports doing that. Looking forward, I do see that you'll have the general seasonal trends and that we'll see some fall-off in gasoline demand, again, a lot of that probably weather related. But I would expect as we head into the third and fourth quarter that gasoline would get some weaker and distillates strengthen, and we'll put ourselves back into a max distillate mode. The other thing I think happens in the market is, the Northwest Europe 2-1-1 yesterday was around $15. And as it falls below $15, that's when you start to see utilization in Europe fall. And so I think you'll see utilization fall, some due to economics in Europe and then also seasonal maintenance, which will open up the distillate arb again from the U.S. Gulf to start supplying that market with diesel. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Gary, maybe I could just risk a quick follow-up on that topic. There has been a lot of chatter about delays and ultimately startups, and you're finally coming in Middle East refining. That obviously is probably going to back into the Atlantic Basin some European product. So I'm just curious. From an international perspective, we've all been waiting on this international refinery expansion coming, and it never really seems to have arisen. Do you have any perspective as to whether those things are finally coming online, and if so, how you see it impacting the current market environment? And I'll leave it there, thank you. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : The only thing I can really tell you is we have not seen an impact in the current market from anything happening in terms of the refinery capacity additions. And our view is that the place that you'll probably see that is more in the eastern Med, which is not really a market we tend to go into. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Doesn't that back into the Atlantic Basin though? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : It could, but again, we have not seen any indication of that as of yet. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Doug, the other thing to keep in mind is that U.S. Gulf Coast refining is very competitive. And so your concern is that ultimately these barrels get pushed back at us, what you might do is have some rationalization. But I think that goes to \u2013 if you're going to assume it's a zero-sum game, there's going to be winners and losers, and U.S. Gulf Coast refining is going to hold its own very well. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Talked a lot about returning capital to shareholders and improvement this year and absolutely deserve congratulations for that. I'm curious though. Given a year where margins have been so strong, obviously helped out on the West Coast, fairly \u2013 if I look at Q3 guidance for throughputs, not really much growth year over year relative to actual numbers. The growth in McKee, what else should we be thinking of as we look forward to 2016 in terms of thinking about earnings growth or cash flow growth or free cash generation? Is it more modest CapEx that helps out? It's hard for us to think about replicating West Coast margins, although the Gulf Coast could obviously be strong. I'm just trying to think about, other than the growth in VLP, where else do we look for some increases in 2016 and maybe into 2017? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We spoke to this briefly earlier today. We've got three projects that will be on stream certainly by the beginning of next year. We've got the two crude toppers, Corpus and Houston, and those will produce significant returns for our shareholders. And then we've got the Line 9 project, which Gary mentioned earlier. We've invested a couple hundred million dollars to prepare to process that crude at our refineries and we haven't received the benefit of that yet. So we've got those three things that are clearly in hand. And then down the road we've got the Diamond pipeline, which will certainly add benefit to the Memphis refinery. And then as I mentioned, we've got the methanol project that we continue to look at. And then Lane's got some other smaller that you'd almost call self-help or optimization projects, which we're running the traps on. And then Martin Parrish has some of those similar type of projects for the ethanol business. So there's no hydrocracker, Roger, that's coming on that's going to create some step change in what we're looking at, but we don't feel we need to do that. We've got a great portfolio that we're executing very well. We have a great team that's making sure that our assets are available and running, and we will see continued growth as a result of that. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I appreciate the answer. And then getting back to the questions that have been asked earlier on the distillates side, a small part of the overall complex, the jet inventories have really increased significantly over the last several months. I'm just wondering if there's any color you can provide on that. I'm talking about total U.S., but you could also point to Gulf Coast jet is up fairly significantly. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : I really don't know that I have any commentary on that, Roger, on what's driving that. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, good enough for me. Thanks, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. You may go ahead. Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning. I hope you're doing well. Gary, I wanted to go back. I think there was a lot of discussion on the strength of gasoline, and you talked about potentially maximizing distillate and gasoline depending on the market dynamics. If my model is set up correctly, it looks like you've been trending at a product yield toward gasoline to the tune of about 48% pretty consistently. Can you remind us what kind of flexibility you actually have to swing that back and forth? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: This is Lane. I'll give it a shot. So right now with naphtha so dislocated, normally we'd flex that in and out of the distillate pool, but you really need to compare it to jet. So if you say if it's really discounted we're going to take that out of the mix. We have about probably a 4% ability to change our gasoline to distillate mix. If you were to be in a posture where you have been trying to make naphtha, it would be even bigger than that. It would be more like 8% to 9%. But today, we've been trying to minimize naphtha just because of where the market is on naphtha. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, Lane, is it fair to think going into 3Q we may see a little bit higher yield on gasoline just given its strength here? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Gary alluded to it earlier. We run our models and we have a forward view and we run our assets into that forward view. And I think seasonally, most of it \u2013 somewhere in October-ish we normally see a switch in the signals where we'll maximize diesel at the expense of gasoline. Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.: Okay. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, Blake, are you trying to understand, are we maximized on gasoline today at a 48% yield? Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.: Yes, yes. R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: The answer to that is yes. Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.: Okay, okay, I'm just trying to get a step change going in moving forward. So, Joe, you briefly touched on M&A at the parent company level. And I guess as I look at the equity price moving higher as a result of these aggressive buybacks, I'm just curious. Is it fair to think that as the stock price moves higher and you have considerations of what to do with capital, does asset-based M&A become more likely as Valero shares move higher? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I wouldn't say it's more likely because, Blake, we always have an eye towards it, and we tend \u2013 and historically we've done this too. We've tended to look at M&A opportunities outside of the context of the capital budget because Mike's got a balance sheet here that's like gold-plated, and so we have plenty of opportunity here without using the equity to do that. Our real focus here has been twofold, and we've talked with you about this. Number one, try to demonstrate earnings potential for the company through excellent operations, and try to get our multiple to the point where we're not trading at a discount to the peer group, and that's the number one focus. Number two then, what that does is provide you with the opportunity to do something with the equity if you ever choose to do a very significant transaction. And although we don't have anything like that on the radar screen today, we could do fairly sizeable transactions with the balance sheet as it sits today without \u2013 and in this case, it would be highly accretive transactions without negatively impacting things. Now that being said, we've looked at the market, we've looked at what's out there, and we just haven't seen anything yet that warrants us to do that. Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.: That's very clear. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC. Brad, you may go ahead. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, everybody, maybe one for Gary. Thinking about McKee, you guys have obviously made some strides into getting more Midland barrels into that refinery. Do you have any thoughts on Midland trading at a premium right now, whether you think that's sustainable, and whether you guys are optimizing the Midland out of that refinery and going back to Cushing, or how are you dealing with it in? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : We don't have a lot of flexibility at McKee to swing between the Midland and Cushing markets. A lot of what we have are term contracts with producers that are tied to one market or the other. I think we're probably in a realm where Midland stays fairly strong because there's a lot of takeaway capacity from that market. And so our view would be that Midland stays pretty close to parity to the Cushing market or could trade at a slight premium to it. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thanks for that. And then, Joe, any thoughts on the proposed renewable volume obligations at this point? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's very interesting, and I'm sure you've read some of the same stuff that we've read here recently. The notion of shifting the obligation seems to be being recognized as a potential positive. I think that there was a letter that was put out here this past week that somebody shot across my desk, which talked about the fact that shifting the obligation might actually lead to incremental blending of ethanol. And so it certainly would be a huge benefit to us if that were to take place. Martin, is there anything you'd like to add? Martin Parrish - Vice President- Alternative Fuels : I think on the RVOs itself, certainly for 2015 it's pretty achievable. You get a little tighter to the blend wall in 2016. But with the carryover RIN, we don't see that as a real big issue. So the question, as Joe said, is where does the obligated party go and what happens in 2017. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And that's more of a long-term solution for us than short-term relief, but we're hopeful. We always are. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. You may go ahead. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey guys, two quick follow-ups. One, in the past, Joe, I think Valero raised dividends two times a year, and the second time is around this time. And so on a going-forward basis, have you guys changed the process to become more of an annual process? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Paul. We have raised it two times a year. Typically, they've been a little bit more modest than the one that we did back in January. And I can let Mike speak to this a little bit. Do you want to take a shot? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I guess we had a very significant increase in the dividend in January. And as I had mentioned earlier, obviously, we've got a material amount of cash, so we will be looking at our options to utilize that cash over the next few months. One of those is obviously the dividend. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. I guess, Joe, what I'm asking is that is there an intent, effort from management to change that to become an annual consideration, or that this is more ad hoc, that we shouldn't really look at say in the past it was two times a year and now that you look like this year is one time, to see if there's a process that we should know. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, I understand, Paul. Let me just say this. Bi-annual (sic) [Semi-annual] (59:36) increases in the distribution, in the dividend, wasn't something that we've institutionalized. And so in this case, the large increase we had back in January was because we were lagging. And I think we have a sense that there's opportunity to raise the dividend again. Now what I don't want you to do is hold me something going forward that we're going to continue to raise the dividend twice a year into perpetuity. But I do think it's safe to say, as Mike described, that we're taking a good hard look at it. And, Paul, you know how devastating it is if anyone ever has to cut the dividend, so we're more deliberate on that. It's obviously easier for us and provides for flexibility to buy back shares and return cash that way, but we are looking at the dividend. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure. The second one is for Lane to see if there's any opportunity in the reformate (1:00:32) for your alkylate or re-former units in your system, or that you're already maxxed out, there's really not much of a debottleneck opportunity there? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Hey, Paul, I alluded to this earlier. We did, this was unusual versus where the signals around the re-formers have been in a couple of years. So we had to relearn in terms of where we could run the re-formers. We've always been maximizing alkylate. Our alkylation units have been very good for several years now, but we are at our maximum in reformate and alkylate capacity today. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Have you gone into and seen whether you can make some small investment and be able to expand the capacity on those units inside your system, or that you haven't done that process yet? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: We are. We did a robust look at all of our alkys. We started really looking at our alkylation units about three years ago and figuring out where we want to spend \u2013 where we wanted to put the dollars, and that's where we landed on this Houston alkylation project. Obviously, it's in our gated process. Joe has mentioned several times on the call. We have a list of smaller projects that we're working. We're being careful not to try to tout them ahead of when they would be ready for show time. But there's clearly an opportunity to address this octane shortfall in the market, and so we're obviously working with those projects. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. You may proceed with closing remarks. John Locke - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Okay, we appreciate all of those who called in today and everyone listening. If you have any additional questions, please contact me or Karen [Ngo]. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Now I will turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter, as our team operated safely and efficiently. Favorable product margins, which were supported by strong demand during the quarter, incentivized us to run at high utilization rates. While we are seeing some seasonal pressure on product margins today, demand for our products remains strong and crude oil markets continue to be well supplied, so we maintain our favorable outlook for 2016. We continue to focus on our priorities of maintaining safe and reliable operations, investing in our business, and returning cash to stockholders. Regarding strategic investments, we continue to grow our business. We expect to see contributions in the fourth quarter from our recently completed McKee crude unit expansion, Port Arthur hydrocracker expansion, and from delivered crude off of Enbridge Line 9B. Additionally, we're making good progress on our two crude unit projects. The Corpus Christi crude unit is ahead of schedule and is expected to start, with a startup date of December 1. We expect startup of the Houston crude unit around the end of the first quarter of 2016, as scheduled. We also executed another dropdown transaction earlier this month to Valero Energy Partners, which is our sponsored MLP. And finally, regarding cash returns to stockholders, over the first nine months of this year we've delivered a 73% payout of net income, so we're on track to hit our 75% target for 2015. Additionally, the Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in the regular quarterly dividend, which is the second increase approved this year. So with those highlights, John, I'll turn it back over to you. John Locke - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Joe. Moving on to the quarterly results, we reported net income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share versus the third quarter 2014 earnings per share of $2.00. The refining segment generated operating income of $2.3 billion. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which was in line with the third quarter of 2014. Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the third quarter of 2015 in spite of unplanned downtime, including the refinery-wide outage at our Texas City refinery due to a lightning strike. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.80 per barrel in the third quarter of 2015 were also in line with the third quarter of 2014. The ethanol segment generated $35 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2015 versus $198 million in the third quarter of 2014. General and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $179 million in the third quarter of 2015. Also in the third quarter, net interest expense was $112 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $482 million. The effective tax rate was 32.4%. With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end total debt was $7.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.3 billion, of which $51 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was approximately 20%. Valero had over $5 billion of available liquidity excluding cash. The cash flows in the third quarter included $467 million of capital spending, of which $109 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. We returned $1.3 billion in cash to our stockholders in the third quarter, which included approximately $200 million in dividend payments and $1.1 billion for the purchase of 17.2 million shares of Valero common stock. Year to date we've purchased 35.5 million shares for $2.2 billion. So for modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.55 million to 1.6 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 235,000 to 255,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 480,000 to 500,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be around $3.80 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.85 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation for the fourth quarter to be around $200 million, and net interest expense should be about $100 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $475 million, and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 30%. Ethan, we've concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we will open the call to questions. During this segment, we continue to ask that our callers please limit each turn to two questions. Callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions as time permits. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil, please go ahead. Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Neil. Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Joe, can you talk about \u2013 and you alluded to it \u2013 the outlook for product margins as Valero sees it? It sounds like the decline we're seeing in your view is more seasonal than structural. There has been a lot of talk about gasoline versus diesel. And anything you could comment on the demand side, so just broadly some commentary on the product margin outlook would be helpful. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Neil, if you're okay, we'll let Gary Simmons talk about that. Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That would be great. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Neil, this is Gary. I certainly do see that what we have this year is just the seasonal nature of our business. We start to get out of gasoline season and you see the gas cracks begin to soften, and typically we go through a period of time where refinery margins are squeezed until heating oil demand begins to kick in. I think the surprise this year is actually the gas cracks were much stronger for a longer period of time than what we typically see. Even today, a light sweet refiner in the Gulf has a $9 crack spread. If you're running medium sour, it's around $12. And a heavy sour refiner in the Gulf has a $15 crack spread. So to us, those numbers don't look bad at all for this time of year. We see good product demand on the distillate side. Our export markets remain strong. And then on the gasoline side, as the markets in the Gulf have softened some, it's opened up the arbs to start gasoline exports as well. So we feel pretty good about the markets going forward. Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, Gary. And then the follow-up question is around the dividend. You guys raised your dividend by 25%. So can you talk a little bit about what drove the decision, how you're thinking about the allocation of capital between dividends, buybacks, and organic growth? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay, Neil, this is Mike. We went ahead and increased the dividend this quarter. We're having a great year, and we thought it was appropriate to increase it at this time. Going forward, ultimately we would like to get to the position of increasing the dividend annually. And our intention is to pay a dividend at the top end of the range for our peer group. Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then, Mike, between buybacks and dividends, any thoughts there? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : On the dividend payout, our intention is to be at the top end of the range of our peer group. And then as we increase that, buybacks would be a little bit less of the total pie. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Neil, the only thing I'd add to what Mike said is, in the investor presentations we made \u2013 and management made the commitment at the beginning of the year that we'd look at the use of our cash in a non-discretionary and a discretionary way, and clearly we view the dividend as something that is non-discretionary. So when we commit to doing the dividend, we believe we need to maintain the dividend. And so as Mike said, it was a good time to do it. We've had a great year. We want to reward our shareholders, and we'll continue to look at it going forward. So when you look at the total payout ratio, it's based on net income, and we've been very forthright about that. All we're doing really in this case is altering the makeup of that payout ratio and increasing the percentage that would be made up of the dividend. Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. All right, thank you so much. Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Neil. Operator : And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Evan, please go ahead. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Let me tie your macro comments in the prior answer to the return policy and connect the two. You raised the dividend, had a large step-up in the buyback in the third quarter. I know you have the annual payout guidance which you're closer to your target, but you also have significant room in your net debt to EBITDA guidance. So how do you adjust the buyback between these two metrics according to the margin environment, meaning given your macro view, should we expect a continued pace of buybacks even in a seasonally weaker quarter? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We increased the payout target from 50% to 75% on the last call. So we had to pick up the buybacks quite a bit to meet our commitment to our shareholders and payout to 75%. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, Evan, as Mike said, I think you can expect that we're going to hit the 75% target. That's our objective. So if you're trying to gauge pace of buybacks in the fourth quarter, they're probably going to be at a somewhat slower pace than they were in the third quarter, as we made up ground during the third quarter. I think going forward, as Mike has talked about, we want to maintain the dividend at the high end of the range of the peers. So we will continue to look at it. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's based off of net income. And so we're not providing earnings guidance here on what the fourth quarter would be. So if net income comes in very strong, we'll be buying back a lot of shares. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, that makes sense. Let me ask a different question, my second question, on the midstream side. I know you funded the last drop to VLP. If that market remains closed, would you do that again in 2016, or can you talk about how you're thinking about that going forward? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay, the last \u2013 and this is Mike again. The last drop on October 1, our plan was all along to self-fund that drop. On the capital markets, based on our discussions with the bankers, we do not believe that the capital markets are closed. We believe that they're open. The equity markets have been challenging. There's not been a lot of activity in the last six weeks or so on the equity side, but we do believe that the markets are open. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, I'll leave it there with two, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Evan. Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Evan. Operator : And our next question comes from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse. Edward, please go ahead. Johannes M. L. Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, it's actually Johannes here playing stand-in for Ed at the moment, a couple of quick questions. First one, I was wondering what your West Coast outlook is given that it was so strong over the last quarter going into next year. Do you have a view on what turnaround activity in 2016 would be and how that may impact that particular crack? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Yes, I think we definitely see a lot of turnaround activity in the fourth quarter of this year, which will probably keep the West Coast market fairly tight. As you move into next year, I think we've seen a good demand response as a result of lower flat price on the West Coast. That will certainly keep that market tighter than what we've seen in the past several years, so we're fairly optimistic on our West Coast operations for next year. I don't really have any insight to turnaround activity. I don't know, Lane, if you... R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: This is Lane. I think it's fairly public knowledge you have a heavy turnaround season currently going on and into the very beginning of the fourth quarter. But I don't have any insight into where the turnaround activity is going to be on the West Coast the first half of next year, and we don't give any forward guidance for Valero in that respect either. Johannes M. L. Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And generally over the last year there's been a reasonable amount of M&A, either outright M&A and/or acquisition of assets, and that's in the midstream and in the downstream segments. Is there a reason you haven't participated in it, or is there a way you're thinking about M&A and growth that we could use to see through your eyes, so to speak? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we do participate. We do look at the opportunities as they do become available to us. We have not I guess been able to consummate an acquisition during this time. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And again, our attention to M&A hasn't changed. We continue to look at everything that's out there. And obviously, there have been a couple of deals that have been done. There are a couple of refineries that have transacted this year. And as Mike said, we look at them. And if they're of interest to us we pursue them, and if they're not we don't. Obviously in this case, they weren't of enough interest to us for us to be aggressive. When you look at the space that might be more rich with opportunities going forward, it seems to be more the midstream business. And again, we look at the opportunities out there, but we've been pretty clear about what we want to do. To the extent we transact there, we'd like for it to be assets that are supportive of Valero's core business. So our view of M&A hasn't really changed, nor has the level of activity that we pursue internally. We just haven't pulled the trigger on anything. Johannes M. L. Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Is there a framework you use to evaluate the value proposition when it comes to those businesses that might be related to your core business? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Yes, but I don't think we're going to get into what our acquisition criteria is with you, no offense. Johannes M. L. Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, no problem. Thank you. John Locke - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Thank you. Operator : and our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Ryan, please go ahead. Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. It's Igor Grinman here actually chiming in for Ryan. I had a quick question on the crude slate in the quarter. It seemed like the light sweet mix was around \u2013 it looked like record levels or at least as far as I could see here. I'm just curious as to what drove that preference for light sweets in the quarter given the relative widening seen on the sour dip side. Was it running next gasoline mode (18:47) related, or were there some other drivers there? And along the same context, it would be great to hear your latest outlook on the lights versus sours differentials for 2016. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : So you're correct, we did run record levels of domestic light sweet crude during the third quarter. That was somewhat tied to where the crude differentials were, but we also see rate lever that we get from running a lighter crude diet, so that pushed us in that direction. And then also with the strength in gasoline, we get a higher gasoline yield off those types of crudes, so that pushed us to the domestic light sweet as well. As we transition into the fourth quarter, the crude markets remain very volatile. And so we have definitely transitioned to where we're running a lot more sour crudes in the system today than what we did in the third quarter. I think as you move to 2016, as long as we're in this market that the crude markets are oversupplied, you're just going to see a lot of volatility between the grades. And so we are just going to be responsive. As the markets move, we'll run the diet that is most economic in our refineries. Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, what are you guys generally expecting out of the 1Q turnaround season? I know you brought up maybe some color on the West Coast side, but just overall U.S.-wide color would be great. R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: This is Lane. We obviously have a dialogue with all of our contractors and we have a large business with them. And the outlook that they're telling us is it will be a fairly heavy \u2013 the first quarter of 2016 will be \u2013 I mean the first half of 2016 will be heavier than the first half of 2015. Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right, great. Thank you, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Phil, please go ahead. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Not to beat a dead horse on the dividend, but you had a big step up in the first quarter, and this is another sizeable step up. So I was just wondering how you thought about this one in terms of whether it was a bit of a catch-up still going on here to get it to the spot where you wanted as a percent of cash from operations or something along those lines, and whether the increases moving forward would be more ratable over time. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think if we looked at it, we were behind the peers. And Mike laid out what the objective was, Phil, and it's to pay out towards the higher end of that. And so I guess you could look at it as a make-up, in fact, the whole year. I think when we looked at it, we were behind going into the year, and we felt that we needed to try to get caught up. So obviously, that was the case. I think as we get closer to the peers, I think this thing \u2013 the prospective increases would be at a more moderate level. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Second question is just with Line 9B now ramping up, how soon would you expect to see a benefit? To what magnitude do you think you can get access to all of the crude that you're hoping to get through Line 9B, or is there any kind of delay in getting any of those barrels to Quebec? And how do you think about the impact that this would have on margins for the refinery? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : This is Gary again. We purchased pretty much our full volume on what we had committed on Line 9 for November injection, and so those barrels will begin to start showing up in Montreal in December and making its way to the refinery. In terms of the barrels that are available to us, it's pretty much what we had planned, so we have a mix of Bakken and MSW and Syncrude from Western Canada. With the arb being narrower, the economics aren't quite as strong as what we had envisioned, but Line 9 barrels are still at or better than what we can do from a U.S. Gulf Coast sourced domestic light sweet barrel. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, got it, thank you. John Locke - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Phil. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Jeff, please go ahead. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : It's Jeff Dietert with Simmons, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jeff. We knew who you were. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : If you could, let's talk a little bit about some of the outages during the quarter, with emphasis on Texas City with the lightning strike. But also, I believe you had some FCC [Fluidic Catalytic Cracking] and alkylate unit downtime during a period when octane was tight, and I was hoping you could talk about the influence those had on 3Q. R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Jeff, this is Lane. Our unscheduled downtime during the third quarter cost us about $116 million, with the big event being this lightning strike that knocked out our substation at Texas City. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : And were there meaningful FCC and alky units down during the quarter? Did that have a meaningful influence as well? It's okay to... R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: I quantified the impact on our results. I'm not really \u2013 I don't think \u2013 I'm not going to comment on the impact that might have had on the market, if that's what you're looking for. I'm just saying \u2013 I'm giving you what happened to us. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : All right. And when you think about the tightness in the octane market and the premiums we saw there, is your view from an industry perspective that that's transient or structural? We did have some industry FCC outages and reformer and alkylation unit downtime and very strong high octane retail gasoline demand. Could you talk about that issue? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Jeff, this is Gary. At least my view is it is more structural in nature. We did have some refinery downtime, but I don't think that was the key driver. I think that as the Gulf Coast refineries are running lighter crude diets that we're out of reforming capacity, you become long naphtha. And as long as you have a strong gasoline market, there's an incentive to blend that naphtha into the gasoline pool, and to do that it takes high octane blend components. In addition to that, some of the big growing export markets have specifications that require high alkylate blends, not necessarily even for octane. And then finally, I think one of the things that we've seen this year is with where aromatic pricings have been, both toluene and xylene have been under their blend value, which has allowed both of those components to be in the gasoline pool. Assuming we have some strengthening in the aromatics pricing moving forward, you can see that both of those high octane blend components actually get pulled out of the pool and octane premiums remain strong. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Thanks for your comments. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays, Paul, please go ahead. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Two quick questions actually. One, Mike, do you have guidance or a target for the cash payout to your shareholders for 2016 and 2017 yet? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, we don't. We're not prepared today to give the payout target for 2016, but I would anticipate that we'll do that early next year. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, and secondly, maybe for Joe. Joe, on the last six months, the MLP sector has been under tremendous pressure. Just curious that the changing market conditions, does it in any shape or form have changed the management view to how you're going to manage VLP and what that means in terms of the dropdown pays or organic or inorganic investment in that business, and how that relates to the C-Corp. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's a good question, Paul. Let me let Mike fire away first and then if there's anything to add. Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Obviously, the capital markets have been very volatile. We continue to market that. But our plan is to continue to execute upon our previously communicated dropdown guidance for 2016, and that's around $1 billion of assets. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. John Locke - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Paul. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Paul, please go ahead. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, guys. It was a little bit of a follow-up or somewhat asked by Paul already, but I was wondering about this 75% of net income target. I guess at the highest level, I was wondering why you use net income. It seems like a bit of a bouncy denominator, if that's the right word \u2013 or numerator I guess. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Paul, we're in a volatile business. And whether you use net income or cash flow, I think you just pick one, and we picked net income. So it was one that's very easy for everybody to look at and identify the number. And so it seemed to provide the most transparency from our perspective. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Sure, that's fair enough. And now I guess what you're saying, given that we're new to this, is that your intention is early every year to provide guidance of approximately how much net income share you intend to return? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think you could probably assume that's the case. Paul, I think we did it at your conference last year. And so that's where we laid out the 50% targeted payout ratio. It's our objective to have a stated payout ratio. And again, this is the first year we did it. We set one out there. We viewed it as a target that we wanted to hit. Things went well this year. We were able to raise that target. So philosophically, I think we're going to always look at our cash flows and our free cash and decide what to do with it. And certainly we've set our priorities with the dividend now and with the share buyback program, and we'll continue to pursue it. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Jeff, I wasn't excited enough about our conference in January. I'm super-excited now, so I'll look forward to your announcement January 6. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Paul, we always feel the same way. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Just on a really important thing for us is my second and final question. This whole thing of a view that global distillate is weak, oversupplied, really doesn't come through in your commentary at all. Is this just the strength of Latin America, or could you just provide just more detail, as you see it, on where this distillate is going, and why you can succeed in exporting so much more when there's this perception that the market globally is weak? Thanks. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Paul, this is Gary again. The way we're viewing the distillate markets, we've seen six straight weeks of draws in the stats here domestically. Export demand remains very robust. You have some seasonal maintenance that's coming in. And so I think the combination of seasonal maintenance and exports will keep domestic inventories in check. And then really the wild card is what happens with the weather and heating oil demand. As you look globally, I think a lot is being made of the stocks in the ARA [Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp]. There's just not a lot of tankage over there. So when we talk about inventory being very high, it's 8 million barrels above where it was last year. I think some of the things that we're seeing is that the Rhine River levels are low and hindering some of the typical demand pulls we see out of the ARA. So to some degree, I think we feel like some of the inventory in Europe may be understated or overstated. But we continue to see very good demand, both Latin America and Europe, for diesel, and feel pretty good about those markets. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Interesting, thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi, please go ahead. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. It's Chi, as you know. Hey, just following up on Paul's questions there, could you give us your export volumes for the quarter in both diesel and gasoline? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Sure, this is Gary. Gasoline, we did 89,000 barrels a day of exports, primarily in Mexico and Latin America. And on the diesel side, we did 241,000 barrels a day of exports. It was a 65 :35 split between Latin America and Europe. On the distillate, if you include kerosene, it brought us to about 285,000 barrels a day of total distillates. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Gary, and then just one semantic question here. Your non-controlling interest line was a loss in the quarter. What's the detail behind that? John Locke - Executive Director- Investor Relations : That's primarily Diamond Green Diesel. The loss had nothing to do with VLP. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, so just a loss incurred at Diamond Green? John Locke - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Yes. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, John. John Locke - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Thanks, Chi. Operator : And our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Brad, please go ahead. Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, everybody. Joe, I think in the past, you've certainly had a stated goal of narrowing the multiple discount that Valero trades at versus peers. I think you've done the obvious things on that front with the dividend increases and all the repurchases, certainly showing more CapEx discipline. I'm curious as we move forward here how you see the best path towards narrowing that further. Is it just continuing to execute? Is it buying back more shares? Any color there would be helpful. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Brad, that's a good question and it's one that we continue to wrestle with as we look at the strategy going forward. It's hard to really understand what drives the multiples. We look at sum of the parts, and clearly our portfolio is more levered towards refining perhaps than the peers. And so clearly a more diversified set of earnings streams for the company would be something that might lift that multiple. The other thing that we really couldn't factor in entirely is where having a payout ratio, certainly the dividend that was below the peers might affect us from a multiple perspective. And so you address what you can in a timely manner. And we've addressed now the fact that we've lagged on the payout in the dividend, and we're continuing to look for the opportunities to grow different earnings streams within the business. And the drops from Valero to VLP clearly is targeted at trying to do this. And then we'll continue to look for good projects to grow the refining business, the renewables business, and then we'll look for other business lines that we might be able to get into. The objective would be to do it with a stronger currency. And so we continue to have this as a major point of focus, but I just don't know that there is a silver bullet that you could fire that's going to immediately get the stock rerated and have you up to where your peers are, but we're taking the actions that we can that we think will help drive that way. Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, that's fair. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Gary Simmons, just thinking about spreads, both Bakken and LLS are relatively tied to WTI. Is that a symptom of declining U.S. crude production? Is it a symptom of too much midstream, or is it just that maybe people haven't been able to arb things on the import side particularly quickly? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : No, I think you really hit the nail on the head. We have a combination of overbuilt logistics in light of flat to declining domestic crude production. So with the current market, the U.S. Gulf Coast bound pipelines from Mid-Continent have tariffs that are greater than where actually the market is today. So you're just seeing people with take-or-pays going ahead to ship even though it doesn't look like they have economics on paper, and that's what's really driving the differentials. Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And is that something that you think is going to persist until we see a turnaround in U.S. production? For instance, have you guys changed your behavior and you're importing much more at this point and you expect that to widen the arb back out? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : I think the tariff and the midstream situation is here until we get some recovery in production. I would tell you on the imports, that's more the volatility between grades. I think what we saw is that as people started to see that production was falling, it was very supportive of the domestic light sweet pricing. At the same time, medium sour production in the Gulf was growing and medium sour exports in the Middle East were increasing. So all of a sudden, we saw a fairly wide differential between medium sour and light sweet, and it incentivized us to bring in a lot of imports of medium sour into our system. Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company. Sam, please go ahead. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning, everybody. How are you? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Sam. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: In the press release, you guys updated the topper progress. As Brad just pointed out, LLS is below Cushing right now. Maybe the toppers fixed that. But I don't know, what do you make of what looks like everybody trying to flood the Gulf or avoid Cushing on the marketing side for crude right now? And does that change the economics of the toppers at all, or are you more excited about them or less excited than you might have been six months ago? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : I think the weak LLS market is actually supportive of the toppers. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Right. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Where we were with \u2013 the economics for the toppers assumed LLS/Brent flat. And so as LLS is discounted to Brent, it actually improves the economics of those toppers fairly significantly. I think some of the \u2013 two things causing the LLS-to-TI spread being where it is today. One is this overbuilt logistics and people shipping even though the economics don't appear to be supportive. And then secondly, we have a lot of imports coming into the Gulf. So ultimately, you can't keep having these inventory builds of domestic light sweet. We're going to have to see those differentials come off and incentivize refiners to go back to a lighter diet at some point in time. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks for the color. And then just revisiting the October drop and VLP in general, it's true that MLPs have been really volatile. VLP has seemed to be a lot more stable. I don't want to make you repeat yourself on the thinking behind sponsoring that drop in October maybe to a greater degree than people expected. But just to your view, do you think \u2013 it's sort of a chicken and the egg question. But how much of VLP's stability is a function of the strength of the sponsor and you demonstrating that, or how much of the structure of that drop was really preempted and maybe just more being cautious and preserving your outside capital for another time? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Our plan was to self-fund the drop. With this particular drop, though, we're now at a debt-to-EBITDA of about 3.5 times. And so we'd likely not want to be longer than that on a long-term basis. So with the next acquisition, we're going to have to go get our investment-grade credit rating, which our plan is to do that late this year or next year, have the ability to go to the debt capital markets. And then with the ratio of being 3.5 times \u2013 or approximately 3.5 times, the next acquisition also might require an equity component \u2013 or will require an equity component. So from this point forward, I think you would anticipate the capital markets. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. All right, thanks very much. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Sam. Operator : And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Blake, please go ahead. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks, guys. Good morning, just a point of clarification. Mike, you mentioned being at the top end of the peer group for dividends. I just want to double-check. I'm assuming you're using the metric as a percentage of net income and not yield or some other metric like that. Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We're using payout; that's correct. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And then going back to Line 9, Gary, I don't know if you can help us a little bit here. If you could just remind me, we're seeing Cushing, obviously, has been fairly depleted, and the spread between WTI/Brent has been compressed. Can you remind me of the metrics we should maybe look at as far as what is economical to actually shift those barrels on Line 9 over to Quebec? Should we be looking at Gulf Coast versus Brent, or Brent versus Cushing, just any help you can have there to help us understand it? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : So Line 9 for us is primarily fed with Western Canadian light sweet, then Bakken. And so you're really looking at that spread and comparing it to a U.S. Gulf Coast supply or a foreign light sweet alternative. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And are there any specific numbers you can give to us where it covers transport or where it makes sense to actually move it? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : I don't think we can talk about the tariff we're paying on Line 9. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Blake. Operator : And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug, please go ahead. John Locke - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Doug, are you there? Operator : Doug, your... Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sorry, I had the volume on mute. I apologize. Good morning, everybody. Joe, one of the advantages you guys have had over the years was obviously your heavy crude diet on the Gulf Coast. And I think obviously you've now seen U.S. production it seems go into decline, at least on the domestic side. What are you thinking is the prognosis of the outlook for how you move your \u2013 or how you choose to run your crude in 2016? And I guess what's in the back of our mind is it's really more of a macro question. Iran potentially coming back on stream, one would expect U.S. production tightens up a little bit, and it seems to us that the advantage might move back in your favor. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of a heavy oil advantage. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Doug, we'll let Gary speak to that. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : So, Doug, I think the way we see it is there's just going to be a lot of volatility between grades. And it certainly is an advantage for someone like us with the quality of refining assets that we have that can swing to a light diet, medium diet, and a heavy sour diet. And that's the way this year shaped up, and I don't think we see it much differently next year. There are times when it's certainly been an advantage to run a very light diet, and then there are other times where we see very good value in Canadian heavies or heavies from Mexico or South America. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But speaking more broadly, Gary, I think as you look at Iranian crude coming into the market, obviously, the more sour crudes that are in the market, I think it's certainly to Valero's advantage because we definitely have the ability to process it. And as Gary is pointing out, we always are optimizing the crude slate, Doug, as you know. But having more availability of sour crude, whether they be mediums or heavies, is certainly to our advantage in the Gulf. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you. I have two other quick ones, if I may, Joe. I guess the second one is also on macro. Again, I don't think you're aware. We've made no secret of our concerns over what we've described as exacerbated volatility on margins, and I want to get your perspective. It goes back to your earlier question on the seasonality of gasoline. As we see it, we're sitting with higher inventories of gasoline, and the cut on light sweet crude in the U.S. seems to be significantly higher. So I'm just wondering if you've got any view as to why we've seen such wide swings on gasoline margins in the winter for the last two or three years and whether you think that repeats again this year once the current maintenance period comes up. And I've got a quick follow-up, please. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : I think we've definitely seen increased demand with the lower flat price. Certainly there's seasonality to gasoline. The gasoline cracks have remained stronger longer than they typically do. But I think the things that we see in the market that are supportive of gasoline going forward is the price of gasoline in the Gulf now has opened up arbs for exports. So certainly in our system we're seeing a significant increase in the volumes we're exporting. Imports to the New York harbor have fallen way off, which is supportive of gasoline. Naphtha export economics have changed to where we're really not putting naphtha into the gasoline pool now. We're exporting naphtha to the Far East. We've seen FCC margins fall off some to where you'll see some sparing of FCC capacity, and then some seasonal maintenance. So I think all of those things we feel like are supportive of the gasoline markets going forward. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right, but my point is that when refinery maintenance comes to an end, if you take the exports out of the equation, you'll think of those as a relief valve, if you like. Do you think the Gulf Coast and the U.S. in general is now oversupplied gasoline in the wintertime or not? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Certainly if we run at very high utilization rates and aren't allowed to export, you could become long, but I don't think we see that that will happen. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. My final one, Joe, I guess this is really more for you. The big step up in the buybacks, whether everyone agrees or not, it seems that margins have been somewhat artificially supported by everything that's gone on this year, starting on the West Coast. But why would you choose to step up to such a big level of buybacks in such a seasonal sector, at least in terms of how share prices have typically traded in the past? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Doug, we had free cash flow available and we did what we said we were going to do, and it is what it is. I think as we look at this going forward, we laid out a target and we're going to hit it. We're not here to build cash. We're here to grow our business and to reward our shareholders. And we thought this was the right time to do it and it was the way to do it. And so that's what led to the timing. If we had had reduced margins this year, you probably wouldn't have seen us step up the target. But here again, we are owned by firms out there and individuals that are looking for a return and for us to use the cash prudently, and we think that's what we did. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right, I appreciate the answer, Joe. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is a follow-up from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Brad, please go ahead. Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, just a couple quick follow-ups. I was curious on CapEx. It appears that you are way ahead of the budget for 2015 based on the first three quarters. And it would be something like $1 billion in spending in the fourth quarter to actually reach the target. Is there a particular reason for that? Is it the crude topper spending ramping up perhaps, or why would you not be able to come in meaningfully below it? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, for our capital expenditure guidance for 2015, we do remain unchanged at $2.65 billion. Now when we provide this guidance, just to clarify, we mean capital expenditures, turnaround costs, as well as investments in joint ventures. So September year to date, our total is $1.7 billion, so we are trending below the guidance. However, as you all know, we have an option to become a 50% owner in the Diamond pipeline, and we may exercise that option in this quarter. Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, got it. That's good color. Thanks for that. And then looking at the throughput guidance for the quarter, both Mid-Con and West Coast look to be maybe a little weaker than what we've expected. Is that just turnaround-related? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: We don't really give forward guidance on turnarounds. But when we set the guidance volumes, we do take turnarounds into consideration. I think if you look in the aggregate, the guidance for this quarter is similar to the fourth quarter last year. Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks. Operator : And our next question is a follow-up from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi, please go ahead. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks. I just want to follow up on the heavy crude markets. It looks like Canadian producers now, we know they have pipeline access all the way from Alberta to Houston, and it looks like the volume of deliveries have ramped up into PAD 3 to about 300,000 barrels a day plus pretty ratably year to date from Canada. How much of a structural change do you think this is with this dynamic on pipeline flows in? And how are you seeing Middle East and Latin American producers react on the pricing of their sours and heavies? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Chi, I would say we've definitely seen greater availability of Canadian heavy in the Gulf. We ran record volumes of Canadian heavy in the third quarter. Really, the medium sour pricing seems to be what's setting the price of the heavy sours. All the heavy sour producers know they have to compete with an ASCI or Mars barrel in the Gulf. And so they price their barrels to be competitive on a quality-adjusted basis with that medium sour barrel in the Gulf. And the Canadian is certainly that same way. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Gary, do you prefer to run a Canadian heavy barrel through the cokers, or would you rather go with a Maya or a Latin America heavy? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization : Each barrel presents their own operating challenges, so Lane may be better to answer that. But there are certainly some challenges with Canadian that we don't see with some of the South American barrels that we run. So I don't know, Lane. Do you want to add anything to that? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: You did a fine job answering that. They'd love to run marshmallows in the cokers. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. I appreciate it. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Take care, Chi. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to John Locke for any closing remarks. John Locke - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Ethan. We appreciate everyone joining us today. If anyone has any additional questions, please contact me or Karen Ngo after the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Yolanda, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Locke. You may begin. John Locke : Good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now I will turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Well, thanks John, and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter and full year 2015 were really great for Valero. We operated safely and reliably achieving our lowest ever employee injury rate in refining and reaching an annual average refinery utilization rates of 95%. The markets were favorable during the quarter. Domestic product demand grew supported by lower pump prices and sour crude discounts relative to Brent were attractive to our highly complex refining system. While distillate margins were pressured during unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillate demand in Latin America remained robust. In fact we exported record volumes of distillate and gasoline in the fourth quarter. We continue to execute well in our projects. In the quarter, we successfully commissioned the new Corpus Christi crude unit, the Port Arthur gas oil hydrocracker expansion and the McKee crude unit expansion. Our Quebec City refinery also began receiving crude via Enbridge\u2019s Line 9B. We exercised our option with Plains All American to acquire a 50% interest in the Diamond crude oil pipeline project. Once completed this project will connect Cushing with Memphis and provide us with crude optionality and long-term cost savings versus sourcing crude oil from St. James. Additionally, Valero Energy Partners continue to execute its growth strategy and Valero GP\u2019s interest in VLP reached the high splits with the distribution increase we announced earlier this week. We also continued to advance our refining growth strategy. Construction of the Houston crude unit remains on schedule with start-up planned in the second quarter of 2016. And earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved the Houston Appalachian project. This project is estimated to cost $300 million and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019. And finally regarding cash returns to stockholders, we paid out 80% of our 2015 adjusted net income exceeding the 75% annual payout target. Further demonstrating our belief of Valero\u2019s earnings potential, last week our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the regular quarterly dividend $.60 per share or $2.40 annually. With that John, I\u2019ll hand it back over to you. John Locke : Okay, thank you Joe. Moving on to the results, we reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net income from continuing operations of $862 million or $1.79 per share versus $952 million or $1.83 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Actual net income from continuing operations was $298 million or $0.62 per share, which compares to $1.2 billion or $2.22 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts as shown in the financial tables that accompany our release. For 2015, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion or $9.24 per share compared to $3.5 billion or $6.68 per share for 2014. Actual net income from continuing operations was $4 billion or $7.99 per share in 2015 versus $3.7 billion or $6.97 per share in 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 refining segments adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion was in line with the fourth quarter of 2014. Stronger gasoline and other product margins combined with higher refining throughput volumes were offset by lower distillate and petrochemical margins and lower discount for sweet crude oils relative to Brent crude oil. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day which was 34,000 barrels per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Our refineries operated at 97% throughput capacity utilization in the fourth quarter of 2015. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.47 per barrel were $0.29 per barrel lower than the fourth quarter of 2014, largely driven by favorable property tax settlements and reserve adjustments and lower energy cost. The Ethanol segment generated $37 million of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $154 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 due primarily to lower gross margin per gallon driven by a decline in ethanol prices versus relatively stable corn prices. For the fourth quarter of 2015, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $206 million and net interest expense was $107 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $494 million and the effective tax rate was 28% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate was lower than expected due primarily to a reduction in the statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom and the settlement of income tax audits in the United States. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $7.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.1 billion, of which $81 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 20%. We have a $5.6 billion of available liquidity excluding cash. The cash flows in the fourth quarter included $732 million of capital investments, of which $164 million was for turnarounds and catalysts, and $136 million was for our investment in the Diamond pipeline. For 2015 capital investment included $1.4 billion for stay-in business and $1 billion for growth. We returned $1 billion in cash for our stockholders in the fourth quarter which included $240 million in dividend payment and $767 million for the purchase of $11.1 million shares of Valero common stock. For 2015 we purchased 44.9 million shares for $2.8 billion. For 2016, we maintain our guidance of $2.6 billion for capital investments including turnarounds catalyst, joint venture and strategic investments. This consists of approximately $1.6 billion for stay-in business and $1 billion for growth. For modeling our first quarter operations we expect throughout volumes to fall within the following ranges. US Gulf Coast at 1.61 million to 1.66 million barrels per day, US Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day, US West Coast at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day, and North Atlantic at 465,000 to 485,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $3.85 per barrel. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash cost, such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation for the first quarter to be around a $175 million and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $470 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 32%. That concludes our opening remarks. Now before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request the callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their questions which are also important. If you have more than two questions please rejoin the queue as time permits. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your line is open. Blake Fernandez : Guys, good morning. Just a quick question on the alkylation unit. First, can you provide any kind of return expectations that you have for the project? And then secondly on the spending profile, it looks like your CapEx guidance in the 2016 is about the same as it was before. So, I\u2019m just kind of confirming that most of the spending probably is weighted towards 2017 and 2018? Lane Riggs : Well, hey, Blake, this is Lane. Yes, the Board approved the alkylation unit [normally] [ph] about $300 million, the [indiscernible] EBITDA is about $105 million, if you use 2015 prices it would be about $140 million EBITDA. With respect to the budget we, when you look at our original - when we gave out the 2016 guidance on our budget for this year two years ago, it\u2019s up about a $100 million and it\u2019s normally the Port Arthur turnaround. We have little more turnaround than we had in our outlook was two years ago, but certainly and then all the rest of it, the alky is clearly fitting inside our $100 billion a year strategic capital, it\u2019s normally about $100 million a year and it is back-weighted like you said towards 2017 and 2018. Blake Fernandez : Okay, Lane. Secondly, just maybe if you don\u2019t mind sharing some thoughts around light heavy spreads into 2016 and I guess what I am thinking especially in light of Iranian barrels coming to market that could potentially displace some other barrels globally, seems like maybe that would have an indirect benefit to Valero given your - given your leverage to Gulf Coast in heavy processing? Gary Simmons : Yes. Blake, this is Gary Simmons, you know overall, yes, we\u2019ve seen very good spreads between the medium sours and light and heavy sours as well. And certainly the Iranian production coming online will put further pressure on those differentials. I think we see several things in the market, you know the increase in OPEC productions, putting medium sour barrels into the Gulf. You see Gulf of Mexico deep-water medium sour production rising at the same time we\u2019re seeing some of the light sweet production falling off here in the United States so it\u2019s leading to very good differentials. I think the other thing that you know, a fundamental shift is where fuel oil had been trading around 80% of Brent, it\u2019s now trading around 60% of Brent, which should mean that, we would expect to see good medium sour and heavy sour differential throughout the year. I think the other thing for us, the Iranian production, of course we won\u2019t be running any of those barrels, but we do think the market rebalances and make some additional heavy and medium grades available to us from Latin America. Blake Fernandez : Great, thanks for the color, Gary. I appreciate it guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Neil Mehta : Hey, good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Neil. Neil Mehta : So Joe and Gary, you guys have a unique window into what\u2019s happening from a product demand perspective, it\u2019s one of the big debates in the oil markets right now. Can you talk about what the export markets look like from your perspective for diesel and gasoline, and then to piggy back off of that, you\u2019ve seen four weeks now of these gasoline builds in the [BOEs] [ph], is that consistent with what you\u2019re seeing on the ground? Gary Simmons : Yes, Neil, this is Gary. I think we continue to see very good export demand for our products, as Joe mentioned we had record volumes in the fourth quarter, we continue to see good demand for both distillate and gasoline abroad. Our rack volumes remain very strong; we\u2019re moving a lot of products over the racks, have seen good domestic demand for our product as well. Certainly, I think when you get this early in the year it\u2019s kind of hard to dissect the [BOE] [ph] data, we\u2019ve seen large builds as well, some of the data does look a little suspect. I think we\u2019ve seen a lot of weather issues in the Gulf, that our belief may have been that it hindered some of the waterborne barrels from being able to leave due to fog and weather that we have had in the Gulf. The Mississippi River flooding also has hindered some of the refiners along the river, their ability to clear those barrels as well. I think we\u2019re just too early to really get a good view of what demand\u2019s going to look like, but everything from us, our perspective looks good. Joe Gorder : Yes. The fundamentals I think for strong demand are still there. There is no question about that, I mean we continue to have prices that are very attractive at the street and then there is a lot of data that\u2019s coming out recently on vehicle miles traveled being up and also on, auto sales being skewed towards larger SUVs and light heavy trucks. So, again as Gary said, it seems like every January Neil we find ourselves in a situation where we\u2019re looking at the year and everybody is trying to figure out, oh gee, is this over and is demand going to be totally eroded, and as he said I think it\u2019s just a little early to tell, but fundamentally it looks like things should go well for us going forward. Neil Mehta : I appreciate that. The second question Joe, this to you is, just the outlook for M&A and I think in the past you\u2019ve said that you want to see that relative multiple between Valero and the Group move a little bit higher before you be more aggressive around M&A. So just your latest thoughts there and then also at the parent level and the also at the midstream level. Joe Gorder : Okay, and Neil, we gave, we gave Ciskow the responsibility for this M&A activity, which he greatly appreciated, the added a responsibility. So if I give him a crack at this to start? Mike Ciskowski : Yes, thanks Joe. I appreciate it. For Valero our appetite for midstream M&A and M&A in general hasn\u2019t changed. We continue to look at opportunities particularly those that support the earnings growth that we can achieve in our core business. The good news is we have a great portfolio and significant earnings capability as we demonstrated in 2015. More specific to the VLP, VLP hasn\u2019t reached the size where it can execute most of the M&A transactions on its own. But we do continue to evaluate opportunities there as well. But as we said before we remain committed to VLP\u2019s dropdown growth strategy and we\u2019re not interested in a step up transaction that would change VLP\u2019s risk profile or its growth story. Neil Mehta : I appreciate that Joe and Ciskow, thank you. Operator : Thanks Neil. Our next question comes from ED Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ed Westlake : Good morning. Congrats. I think this time last year I\u2019d said I was going to drive down an F350 to Disney World and would that be enough gasoline yield from Valero and other refiners in the summer to make it possible for me to do so? So, I\u2019m going to ask the same question after a year of looking at gasoline markets and some very strong cracks and strong demands. What are you guys doing to be able to make more summer grade gasoline? Gary Simmons : In the short run, I don\u2019t think we really have anything that we have on the horizon that\u2019s going to be able to increase our gasoline yield, but the big thing is the alky project that Lane mentioned that will give us additional ability in terms of making additional gasoline when that project comes online. Joe Gorder : We are in maximum gasoline mode now though it\u2019s [indiscernible]. Gary Simmons : That\u2019s right, we are. Ed Westlake : Okay. And then switching to the self help, obviously the toppers coming on stream, so we start to see them maybe in 4Q and into this year. You used to have sort of $500 million number, I think that\u2019s gone down to 430 million, just a reminder what you think key drivers will be in terms of the spreads driving that 430. Lane Riggs : Hi, this is Lane. So the funny decision on both those units we had Brent and LLS, [indiscernible] pretty much in that environment if you want to - and we like to reference the historical price set. So if you look at those projects in 2015 the Corpus unit would give us about $200 million of EBITDA and the Houston crude unit would be about 230, so those are - and those are slightly [indiscernible] obviously are funding decision that in the current market we\u2019re pretty much at our funding decision. Maybe and as Joe allude to the Houston crude unit will start up in the second quarter and we fired up the crude unit in Corpus Christi without any incident and started fine. Ed Westlake : Okay. And it\u2019s mainly crude against [VGO] [ph] spreads we should look at? Lane Riggs : That\u2019s right, the driver here is crude versus really resid, so low sulphur resids. Ed Westlake : Okay, helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we have a question from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Evan Calio : Good morning guys. Maybe a follow on to the product demand question, given the macro uncertainty pacing your cash returns to the net income makes sense on a quarterly basis. Ye how do you think about using the balance sheet to fund the cash returns buyback and has that changed at all given that macro uncertainty or share price volatility? Mike Ciskowski : Well, our balance sheet is, Evan this is Mike, balance sheet is very, very strong and we intend to keep it that way. Our guidance is to pay out 75% of net income for 2016. So, as far as levering up [indiscernible] to meet that target, I'm not sure it will be required to do that. It's early in the year. So we'll just have to see how the year plays out. Evan Calio : Got it. And then, maybe a different follow-up on you shared the EBITDA on all these new projects, it will be contributing in 2016 and Corpus, Port Arthur, McKee and Houston in 1Q. I mean any color in aggregate how they affect your crude slate flexibility or just related, given, the right economic indicators, where do you need to max out your heavy sour and medium sour runs? Gary Simmons : Yes. So the topper really just gave us more capability to run domestic light sweet barrels or foreign light sweet barrels. It really added to that. We haven't done anything that really materially changes our ability to process medium or heavy sour grades in our system. It was mainly of those two units are adding 160,000 barrels a day of light sweet capacity. Evan Calio : Right, and then but the up-tick quarter-to-quarter on overall heavy and medium sour runs, where could that be? And I'm sure that's an average number. So I'm just trying to get a sense of -- if you are kind of max flexed to this point or where you could take that? Lane Riggs : I\u2019d like to give you a little color on that, Evan. I will take the topper out so you can kind of have an apples-to-apples comparison. If you take the toppers out between last quarter and where we are today, we backed out about 400,000 barrels a day of lower 48 domestic light sweet crude and we've replaced that with medium sour grades and foreign light sweet imports. That's the big change in our system; heavy sours are about the same. Evan Calio : Got it. Appreciate it. Operator : Paul Cheng from Barclays, your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Hi, guys. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi, Paul. Paul Cheng : Mike, actually this is for you. I'm going to ask from the other angle on the balance sheet. The last several years that you guys have done phenomenally well both operationally and financially and also the return to shareholder. I was just curious that as the cash flow remain strong at this point, does it make sense even though you already have a very, very strong balance sheet to maybe utilize a part of the free cash flow, maybe 20% or so, to further strengthen the balance sheet. I think that we all live through the up and down while I'm always on the market, I could be wrong. And that we have seen what happened, everyone was bullish in 2007 and then the bottom fell off because of the economy. So should we actually pick maybe a slightly different view at this point just as a safeguard to ensure that we build up some additional cushion even though your balance sheet is already remarkably strong but if the cash flow cut by half then maybe that will allow you to even have better opportunity to strike and pick the opportunity everyone is weak? Mike Ciskowski : Okay. That's a quite a question Paul. And I remember those days very well. Our balance sheet is very strong and we intend to keep it that way. If you're suggesting that we build cash here, our current focus is to continue to look for opportunities to grow our business and increase our earnings per share. But if you are suggesting that we prepay some debt, the majority of our remaining debt contains make whole provision that made those prepayments less than compelling. Paul Cheng : I see. So that you won't -- you won't able to prepay and you won't say add-on some additional cushion into your balance sheet by adding cash? Mike Ciskowski : No. I don't think at this time that\u2019s what we will be doing. I think we can execute on our payout strategy and all that as I said earlier without levering up the balance sheet. Paul Cheng : And that, Joe, just curious that with that, I think that some of the other company in distress and look like some retail asset maybe become cheaper. If you're looking at your portfolio, does it make sense that the entry point is right for you to reenter into retail by doing so that can -- maybe that cushion your gains, over the [indiscernible] gains, any win -- win cost increase or that to provide even a more direct outlet to your own refi product? Or that this is you\u2019re really not interested in going back into that business? Joe Gorder : No, Paul, that's a good question. We look at it periodically. The retail business is materially different from the refining business, and you know that, I mean we\u2019re refining is capital intensive and [indiscernible] people and the retail business is people intensive. And we \u2013 when we look at it, I think our view would generally be that we don\u2019t need to control the retail outlet to be able to be a very good supplier into that market. And so frankly what we\u2019re focused on is, it\u2019s further extending our wholesale business, where we can have contractual relationships and support the Valero brand hit the street from the wholesale side rather than from a direct retail operation. If you reflect back on our retail volumes when we owned CST in the 1000 or so sites in Canada, the volume we moved through them was about a 125,000 barrels a day. And when you look at that as its order of magnitude relative to the total motor fuels that Valero is producing it\u2019s a very small percentage. It would take a real huge step for us to have any kind of material presence to really allow us to hedge the benefits associated with owning retail directly. So, I don\u2019t know that unless there was really something that was just incredibly good are allowed us to sustain our contractual relationships with customers I don\u2019t see us reentering that market in the retail business. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons and Company. Your line is open. Jeff Dietert : Hey, it's Jeff Dietert with Simmons, good morning. John Locke : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Dietert : I appreciate the update on all the projects, I think the St. Charles hydrocracker, I didn\u2019t see an update on that, I apologize if I missed it. But could you talk about St. Charles? Lane Riggs : Hi, this is Lane. So, we\u2019re currently changing the catalyst out and the capital - it\u2019s a small capital project, $40 million and it\u2019s just really a catalyst change out which is based on the cycle that we, when we change out the catalyst and the capital implementation or doing it right now. So it will be ready to go here in the second quarter. Jeff Dietert : Okay. And could you talk about your EBITDA expectations on Port Arthur and St. Charles hydrocrackers what those are expected to contribute? Lane Riggs : Well, we spent normally about $80 million on the two and our funding decision EBITDA somewhere between a total of $60 million to $80 million so these are an example of the sort quick hitting, self-help, these were also the low hanging fruit to sort of arbitrage out that there may be some [indiscernible], enough to figure out where we can put a little capital and get a pretty good hit on it, so I don\u2019t know if that will show up in the revenue stream or something like that to you guys, it will certainly show up in our margin capture going forward. Jeff Dietert : And could you talk a little bit about Line 9 now that it\u2019s started up and what your flexibility is to take Canadian heavy versus Syn crude versus Bakken, what\u2019s the flexibility there in an environment where you are encouraged to take those grades. Gary Simmons : Yes, this is Gary. So Line 9 we began taking crude in December, it\u2019s fully up and operational and at capacity; in terms of flexibility of grades, all of our crudes to Line 9 through Montreal and we really don\u2019t have logistics to be taking heavier or medium sours, it\u2019s pretty much just for light sweet crude for the Quebec refinery. Jeff Dietert : Great. Thanks for your comments. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Roger Read : Yes, thank you. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi, Roger. Roger Read : I guess maybe coming back to the gasoline question for this summer, octane ability as you look around what do you think the biggest roadblock will be again, is it going to the Octane alkylate side, is it going to be blending stocks and what is your assumption for gasoline demand growth this year, as you set up your expectations and budget? Gary Simmons : Hey, Roger. This is Gary. I think we see that as long as we have a strong gasoline market and we have [indiscernible] sub-octane blend component like naphtha the gasoline pool is going to try to draw naphtha in and it\u2019s going to mean octane is fairly expensive. And so we expect to see alkylate values fairly strong again this summer. I don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that really leads me to believe that it\u2019s going to change anytime soon. Roger Read : Then where, where will the industry look, I mean if you thought about it as a long hanging fruit thing, where would you be looking to pick up octane? I mean one of the thoughts is if US light sweet is declining and we are importing a light barrel, maybe we create a little bit more that way since the US barrel\u2019s tended to be on the low end for octane, but where else should we consider? Gary Simmons : Well, I think for us we\u2019ve tried to look everywhere we can and this alky project was the best thing that we really felt was out there; we\u2019ve studied reforming, expanding reforming [indiscernible] new reformers and the alky project has the best return in our system. Roger Read : But I mean more near-term, is there, are we just going to struggle 16 and 17, I mean I understand where we are in 19 but\u2026? Gary Simmons : Yes, I think we will. I don\u2019t see anything in the near term that that\u2019s going to have a significant impact on the octane balance. Roger Read : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company Sam Margolin : Hey, good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi, Sam. Sam Margolin : I wanted to ask one more about the alky project here. There is a couple of others out there in the system, a lot of times these units as newly built units are paired with like a midstream acquisition or some other project to produce the feed by the operator. But is it fair to say that there is no real necessity to commit capital to source incremental NGLs here there is plenty available and so this alky unit can be built as a standalone or actually is it, does it, is it paired with maybe something coming off the toppers or another attribute of your yield right now? Lane Riggs : Hi, Sam. This is Lane. Ours is a little bit different I\u2019d say than other people in the industry and what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re taking existing alkylation unit at Houston and we\u2019re converting it to alkylate C5 olefins; normally alkylation units alkylate C4 olefins and sometime C3 olefins. So we\u2019re taking the existing blend and retrofit it such that alkylate C5 olefins and we are building a new C4 olefins. What we are really doing if you draw, drew a boundary around the Houston refinery is we are shifting C5 olefins that are going out [indiscernible] gasoline, bringing in IC4 from Mont Belvieu which is readily available and inexpensive that\u2019s really what\u2019s happening in making an alkylate and also blending some additional butane for the low RVP, that\u2019s really what this project is. So it is different than I would say other people that are looking at this, and we are clearly ahead of everybody else in the industry with this projects. Sam Margolin : Okay. Yes, that makes sense. I think it\u2019s been evaluated for quite a while, so it\u2019s clear that there is a lot of, I guess, gone into the process. This next one is sort of a moon shot, as you know, it\u2019s been reported Aramco is maybe looking to monetize some assets, you might also know that Shell has a fairly aggressive divestment target too. I don\u2019t know, is it fair to say that Motiva today is at least as attractive or as sensible of a consolidation candidate as maybe CITGO was two years ago in terms of sort of what\u2019s out there to bring into the fold, to the extent that I think Mike kind of alluded to the appetite hasn\u2019t changed but I don\u2019t know maybe availability of assets has? Joe Gorder : Well, Sam that is a moon shot. I mean Motiva has a good business and they\u2019ve got good assets and if they we\u2019re for sale I\u2019d suspect that we\u2019d take a really good hard look at it, but we are not hearing anything, I hadn\u2019t heard anything that they are in the market. Sam Margolin : All right, appreciate it. Have a good one. Joe Gorder : You bet. Take care. Operator : Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Phil Gresh : Hey, good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi Phil. Phil Gresh : First question just on VLP, how are you thinking about the drop down potential of VLP this year? Last year I think you had committed to a billion in drops, but you didn\u2019t give any specific commentary on the release. So I\u2019m just curios how you are thinking about the MLP market more broadly, evaluation, impacts etcetera? Mike Ciskowski : Okay. Yes I feel right now a billion is our current plan toward the dropdown. But, the capital markets are pretty challenging right now. So we\u2019ll just have to continue to monitor this as we move through the year. Phil Gresh : Okay. Second question is just there has been some talk about the uplift we could see from greater utilization rates from these Chinese refineries and the impact that could have on product export by China. I\u2019m just wondering how your speaking about this risk and do you think China\u2019s product quality can complete on the global market especially on the gasoline side? Gary Simmons : I can, Phil. This is Gary, I don\u2019t know that I can really comment on the quality of their products, overall to me that capacity is capacity that\u2019s going to be very challenged globally because of the weak fuel market. It\u2019s going to be very difficult to run load complexity, capacity with the very low fuel environment. Phil Gresh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ryan Todd : Hey, thanks, good morning gentlemen, maybe said I wanted to say, maybe a quick follow up on the prior question on potential drop to VLP, I mean any thoughts as to what the next might look like between cash proceeds and equity, the Valero or any thoughts on evolution of multiples of those drops or too much uncertainty in the market at this point. Joe Gorder : While there is a quite a bit of uncertainty in the market. So, at this point in time I really can\u2019t comment on how the cash proceeds would be and how the financing of those drops would be structured. Ryan Todd : Okay. And then, maybe one follow up, I appreciate the comment you made earlier in terms of, some of your thoughts on medium sour and heavy sour differential in the sustainability going forward. Maybe can you give me any thoughts in terms of how you see light sweet desk whether its Brent WTI or LLS WTI evolved over the next three to six months, so we are going to need to see a widening of those spreads in order to clear Cushing and to incentivize imports and in particular I was kind of curious given the fact that you backed off 400,000 barrels a day of lower 40 light crude to your system, just generally how you\u2019ve seen, what your outlook is for the light sweet differential going forward over the next, over the course of this year? Gary Simmons : This is Gary. I think over time LLS and Brent traded pretty close to parity, but I think we are going to have a lot of volatility between the grades as the year goes on. So, you know you can see LLS got, has to pay a premium for LLS and Brent, so we started importing foreign light sweets, we have the inventory gains here in the US, which I think tells you LLS was too expensive, so that LLS we discounted. I think we\u2019ll go through that volatility for the next six months, where we swing in and out of domestic light sweet production into our refining system. Ryan Todd : Thanks. I appreciate that. Operator : Doug Leggate from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate : Hi. Thanks. Good morning everybody. Thanks Joe. So Joe, I wanted to go back to your comments on gasoline, I think you said you were in max gasoline mode right now, what I am trying to understand is what happens to gasoline yields as the US swings back to imports on light sweet crude declines, I know everyone is focused on octane but, I\u2019m just wondering if you start to see a tightening of the balance [indiscernible] gasoline at this point I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s because --, I\u2019m just trying to understand the interplay as you see, things going in for the summer. So, I guess I\u2019m really looking to your prognosis on how those things bounce at? Joe Gorder : Gary do you want to go ahead? Gary Simmons : Yes. Overall, if you look at foreign light sweet barrel versus an Eagle Ford or Bakken type barrel and nasty yield from West African Saharan barrel is about the same as Bakken or Eagle Ford. So in terms of refining yield it\u2019s not significantly different whether we are running at West African barrel or we\u2019re running at domestic light sweet barrel. Doug Leggate : Well as you swing back towards medium-heavy, does the yield makes change to them? Gary Simmons : Yes, for medium to heavy barrel, it would accept for most of the refineries were running those barrels are very high complex refining assets. And again we don\u2019t see much of a yield difference with the complexity of our refineries when we\u2019re running a heavier diet. The only thing that we can get into is as we go heavy in some of our plants it can lower our utilization. So we get a lever effect by running light sweet at some of our refineries. So we have a big incentive to run much heavier crude diet it can mean that we are running slightly lower crude rate at some of those plants. Doug Leggate : It tells me about the old school I guess. Thanks for that. My follow-up, it\u2019s probably more a Ciskowski question. Mike, , the tax rate looks like it\u2019s been consistently low now or becoming kind of a regular thing, so should we be looking at tax rate guidance moving lower as kind of permanent shift? Joe Gorder : Well, we had a couple of unique items this past \u2013 this past quarter, because of the tax law finally was, they got final approval in the UK and then we had, we have some audits that are underway in the US and we happened to get those settled this quarter, and so that was reflective which pushed the rate down to 28%. So, we tried to do, the best that we can and given that guidance to you. But, 31%, 32% is what I would say for the first quarter. Doug Leggate : Is that a good run rate going forward? Joe Gorder : Yes, right now that would. Doug Leggate : Okay, helpful. Thanks everybody. Operator : Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Your line is open. Chi Chow : Great, thank you. Joe Gorder : Hey Chi. Chi Chow : Hey, how are you doing Joe. Back on the products markets, can you comment on how you\u2019re assessing the supply demand balance of the global distillate market heading into this year? We saw material weakening of the diesel cracks as the year progress last year and just wondering on your thoughts on cause of this? Gary Simmons : Yes, Chi, this is Gary Simmons. Overall, I think if you look at what drive distillate demand, its weather and then its economic activity and thus far, both in the US and in North West Europe we\u2019ve had warmer winters than what we\u2019ve historically had and so it led to lower distillate demand. So in terms of how do we correct from here, I think a lot of that correction gets back to some of this low complexity refining capacity with discounted fuel oil pricing, I think you know we\u2019ll see some economic run cuts and some of that low complexity, capacity that will bring the distillate market back into balance . Chi Chow : What about the economic activity side of things, I mean you are seeing, you mentioned your exports are still pretty good, but are you concerned about global slowdown on the economic front? Joe Gorder : I don\u2019t know that I can really comment on the global economic activity, but I can say we continue to see very robust demand for our products throughout the globe. Chi Chow : What your exports of gasoline and diesel in the quarter? Joe Gorder : Yes. In gasoline we did 157,000 barrels a day of gasoline, we did 264,000 barrels a day of diesel, if you add kerosene in with that it would be 307,000 barrels a day of total distillate. Chi Chow : Okay, thank you. One other question, this is just kind of specific to your Gulf Coast system, we just noticed that your realized margin capture rate versus your index is always better in the fourth quarter in the Gulf Coast than the other three quarters of the year and that been pretty consistent last four years running. Why is that the case, is there any specific reason for that? Joe Gorder : Well, I would say, certainly the butane blending would come into play there and so as butane has been discounted and we\u2019re able to blend it into the pool, it helps our capture rates, I don\u2019t know if you have anything else. Lane Riggs : Hi, Chi. [This is Lane]. I want to add, normally seasonally what you see is medium to heavy sour discount widen out. So when you\u2019re using for the standard capture rate versus light sweet we always outperform on that as well. Chi Chow : Okay. Hey, thanks Lane, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your line is open. Faisel Khan : Good morning guys. Joe Gorder : Good morning. Faisel Khan : Just quick question on the timing of the projects that came online in the fourth quarter, the Corpus Christi crude unit, the hydrocracker and the expansion of the key and it is also Line 9B sort of highlighted that was December startup, how did those start up in the quarter I\u2019m just trying to understand so what the contribution was from the commissioning of these assets in the quarter, just sort of we get sort of the uplift right going into 2016? Lane Riggs : Hey, it\u2019s Lane. The key we finished that project which really took us about two years fully implement the entire scope that which was two things one was energy efficiency project and distillate recovering the second was sort plus crude rate. We finished it in October. I assume that what you\u2019re after. You\u2019re sort of after the timing --. And further again hydrocracker was down in October and they replaced the catalyst and did the expansion and then Corpus Christi really started up during sort of early to mid December so wouldn\u2019t see anything with respect to it, fourth quarter improvement that\u2019s really going to be entirely 2016 thing. Faisel Khan : Okay, got it. And the key we would have seen full contribution in the quarter, but sounds like Port Arthur was down in October and then of course nothing from the Corpus? Lane Riggs : That\u2019s right. Nothing from Corpus and obviously St. Charles are doing right now. Faisel Khan : Okay. And then, right now given were crude prices are in Canada versus the Atlantic Basin is it make sense to max out Line 9B or where are we with the market in terms of how we benefit from that? Lane Riggs : Yes. So, I would tell you on Line 9B we are seeing some value in the Bakken that we are running most of the Western Canadian light sweets we are not seeing material difference in being uplift in running those barrels compared to foreign light sweets that we get acquired into Quebec. Faisel Khan : Got it. Okay. Great, thanks for the time guys, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Vikas Dwivedi from Macquarie Group. Your line is open. Vikas Dwivedi : Hey, guys, quick question on gasoline and ethanol now, they\u2019ve been inverted for a while. Does that change how you guys blend or any of the approach to the overall gasoline operation given, sort of upside down from formal? Martin Parrish : It's Martin Parrish, it\u2019s really the impact on the blending margin not only refineries margins, ethanol is selling at about its blend value everything kind of the blend value that\u2019s high octane. You have to remember that the blender still gets the RINs if they choose to blend ethanol. So, I know it works out, I don\u2019t, I would say there\u2019s really no impact \u2013 get it blended. Vikas Dwivedi : Got it. And coming back to the LP plant is the C5 technology is that also a call on, kind of an oversupplied ethane or ethylene market down the road? Joe Gorder : I don\u2019t know want to, it\u2019s not my call, it just really, you look at whole NGL market it\u2019s been pretty, if this is been long, and it really a view that we can take and move NGL into the gasoline pool and we can do it by [alkylating amylene] in the refinery which is a little bit different and it makes a good high octane low RVP component which then in turn allows us to blend additional butane in the summer in particular. Vikas Dwivedi : Got it. And we were just thinking if it was a call that would be a great call. I think when we are drowning in the lighter end of the NGL barrel for a long time that? Joe Gorder : I wouldn\u2019t call it ethane, it\u2019s a whole NGL space right which we believe is virtually long going forward to. Vikas Dwivedi : Yes. All right. Thank you, guys. Operator : We have a question from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brad Heffern : Good morning everyone. Joe Gorder : Good morning. Brad Heffern : Circling back to the VLP, I\u2019m just curious we all know the uncertainty the turmoil in the capital markets, but it seems like the strategy is basically unchanged and you have 55% of the growth in 2016 in terms of budget going into VLP. At point do you think about that and maybe re-examine the pace of growth given that the market doesn\u2019t necessarily seem to be rewarding growth as much as it once was? Joe Gorder : Yes. We will continue to \u2013 right now our plan is to do the billion dollars, but we\u2019ll continue to examine and monitor the markets as we move through the year. It is very challenging right now, we do have our revolver that we could use that as a financing source for some of the drops. So, the bank market seems to be a little bit more attractive than the capital market at this point in time. Mike Ciskowski : Brad, let me just add to what Mike said. The capital that we\u2019re investing in logistics assets at Valero Energy are assets that can be dropped to VLP, so we\u2019ll continue to build the droppable EBITDA base. But the motivation behind it and we\u2019ve shared this before, the motivation behind Valero investing in logistics assets are projects that better fit Valero\u2019s core business, its core refining business that project that helps us optimize our operations. And we are not taken flyers on projects that we wouldn\u2019t be willing to commit what contractually long-term to. And so, again the things we are investing in today for example the diamond pipeline, I mean that is going to be a direct benefit to the Memphis refinery and provide crude optionality there that they don\u2019t currently have today. So, this is a long game and even though markets are challenged right now, I don\u2019t think we should sit here and throw the baby out with the bath water and totally redirect strategies to try to accommodate it. The other thing that Mike hasn\u2019t mentioned is that, VLP is in a great position like at very high coverage ratios to maintain distribution growth, that the targets we\u2019ve talked about is not going to be an issue. And here again we are running the business to continue to improve the business and drive the EPS growth at VLO and VLP is going to go along for the ride. Anyway, that\u2019s just a little more color. Brad Heffern : Thanks for that Joe, I think that's clear. And then thinking about logistic opportunities as well, I\u2019m curious obviously lifting in the crude expo we are seeing negative for refiners in general, but I think there might be some opportunities that present themselves to Valero given the amount of dark space in general footprint in the Gulf Coast set. Have you thought along those line Joe? Rich Lashway : Hi. This is Rich Lashway. Yes, we thought about that, that opportunity. We are in conversations with lot of different parties on projects that they have that they willing to share now that they might not have been in the past. And so we could see quite a bit of opportunity out there given not just the declining crude price, but also the export opportunity. Brad Heffern : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our last question is a follow up question from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your line is open. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys, real quick, may be this for Gary. Gary just curious that crude inventory over the last several weeks quite substantial, do you have any rough idea there was a split between the financial buyer, buying it to take advantage on the contango curve, or what percentage is the operator actually the refiner who are building inventory here ? Gary Simmons : I don\u2019t suspect this a lot of refiners building inventory, most of our tankage and most refiners tankage is more operational in nature. So it\u2019s hard to really utilize that tankage for a contango play. Most of that you see some inventory builds in Cushing, but I don\u2019t know that I really could comment in terms of the build. I think you know what we had happened is LLS got at a premium to a foreign light sweet alternative and Valero along with many other refineries started buying light sweet and it caused the inventory to build and certainly the markets structures incentivized people to store as well. Paul Cheng : Okay, thank you. John Locke : Okay, Elanda I think that\u2019s last for the question. So we want to thank you everyone for calling in today and please feel free to call me and Karen if you guys have further follow up questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Bianca and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Locke. Mr. John (sic) [Mr. Locke] (00:21), you may begin. John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team.

I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter presented us with challenging markets with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter. The bright spot was the performance of our team, as we continued to operate safely and reliably. What I'd like to do this morning is take a few minutes to discuss our strategic initiatives that we believe will continue to drive long-term value creation and then share some color on what we are singing in the markets. First, at the core of everything we do is a relentless focus on safety and reliability. Our dedication and persistence here is what keeps our people and community safe, our operations reliable, our cash operating costs the lowest among the peer group. Having low-cost operations is a major advantage in our industry where product margins can be quite volatile. As a disciplined operator, we are able to run profitably in a lower margin environment as experienced in the first quarter. Second, we apply discipline and rigor, as we evaluate and execute investments that will grow the profitability and competitiveness of our business for many years. The strategic plan that was approved by our board of directors last year included $2.6 billion of capital spending for 2016. Approximately $1 billion was allocated to strategic investments to drive long-term earnings growth. Third, we are committed to delivering value to stockholders by making the right investments in our business and returning cash to our stockholders. We demonstrated this in 2015 when we delivered the highest total stockholder return among our peers for both Valero and VLP. We expect VLP to continue to be well positioned to execute its distribution growth strategy through 2017 despite volatile capital markets. We also continue to keep an eye on M&A. We review opportunities and we have a list of targets that we consistently monitor. We consider M&A a discretionary use of cash, so there's a healthy tension when evaluating M&A opportunities versus other alternative uses. Of course, we can't comment specifically on M&A, but we are diligently reviewing opportunities. For cash returns in 2016, which is made up of dividends and buybacks, we've extended our 2015 payout target of 75% of net income. In January, we increased the quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.60 a share, but we remain focused on maintaining a dividend payout at the high end of our peer group. We're confident in Valero's ability to fund investments in future growth and to meet its payout target. Lastly, let me share some color on the current market. Already this year, we've been in a lot of conversations about various market topics including gasoline demand resurgence, octane strength, diesel length, domestic crude supply, and crude storage levels. As you know, markets for Valero's feedstocks and products are dynamic. Our high complexity refineries, system flexibility, advantage locations, and low cash cost operations enable us to maximize earnings under challenging market conditions. On the crude supply side, we are seeing more medium sour crudes coming into the market. As a result, we are seeing healthy medium and heavy sour crude discounts. We also have greater access to domestic sweet crudes with the logistics build out in the U.S., allowing domestic production to clear the Mid-Continent region and reach the large Gulf Coast refining center. On the demand side, continued GDP growth and low product prices should continue to support demand. In the U.S., we are seeing gasoline demand continue to grow. We are encouraged by increased vehicle miles traveled and double-digit percentage increases in SUV and truck purchases in the U.S. and key countries around the globe. Distillate demand globally was good, albeit in the U.S. it's been fairly flat. While distillate margins were pressured near term due to unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillate demand in Latin America remains robust. Overall, we still have structural refined product supply challenges in South America and the developing countries, which we don't expect to be resolved in the near term. With our low-cost Gulf Coast refining presence, we have the ability to compete in markets all over the globe. We also have the opportunity to optimize our system and supply in the Atlantic basin with our refineries in Wales and Qu\u00e9bec City. In fact, we generated another quarter of solid distillate and gasoline export volumes. In summary, we still have significant crude supply, ample natural gas availability and growing global petroleum demand that's outpacing refining capacity additions. We don't see this changing anytime soon, so although the markets will be challenging at times, the longer term macro outlook remains favorable. So, with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you. John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Thank you, Joe. Moving on to the results, net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax lower of cost or market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we reported first quarter 2016 adjusted net income of $283 million or $0.60 per share. This compares to $964 million or $1.87 per share for the first quarter of 2015. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to page six of the financial tables that accompany our release. Adjusted operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2016 was $695 million or $946 million lower than in the first quarter of 2015. Margins were pressured downward primarily due to weaker distillate margins given high refinery run rates across the industry, product inventory builds and unseasonably warm weather. Other headwinds on refining margins included narrower domestic light sweet crude oil discounts versus the Brent benchmark, low fuel oil and petrochemical product margins, and elevated costs for RINs credits. Low crude oil prices continue to drive slowdowns in North American drilling and production, which coupled with an excess of pipeline takeaway capacity in the Mid-Continent region led to tighter discounts for crude oils relative to Brent. Low energy cost supported by robust North American natural gas production partly offset these factors. Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2016 and throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 169,000 barrels per day higher than in the first quarter of 2015. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.55 per barrel were $0.40 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2015 mostly due to higher throughput volumes and lower energy costs. The ethanol segment earned $9 million of adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $12 million in the first quarter of 2015. The low crude oil and gasoline price environment challenged ethanol margins, but with the recent recovery in prices, ethanol margins had modestly improved to start the second quarter. For the first quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate, depreciation were $156 million. Net interest expense was $108 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $485 million, and the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was 30%. The effective tax rate was lower than the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to higher relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates. Regarding our balance sheet, at quarter end, we had $7.3 billion of total debt and $3.8 billion of cash and temporary cash investments, of which $102 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 20%. We had $5.5 billion of available liquidity excluding cash, of which $575 million was only available to VLP. Cash flows in the first quarter included $479 million of capital investments, of which $161 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. For 2016, we expect to invest $1.6 billion of capital to sustain the business and $1 billion for refining asset optimization and logistics to drive long-term earnings growth. With respect to our refining growth strategy, the new Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, operated as planned and delivered approximately $35 million of EBITDA in the first quarter. We completed the St. Charles hydrocracker expansion in March, and the new Houston crude unit is on track to start up in the second quarter. The Houston alkylation project, which was approved in January, is now undergoing detailed engineering and procurement. Completion of the alkylation unit is expected in the first half of 2019. Moving to the financing activities, we returned $547 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $282 million in dividend payments and $265 million for the repurchase of 3.8 million shares of Valero common stock. We had $1.1 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization as of March 31, 2016. Our regular quarterly cash dividend is now $0.60 per share. We continue to target a payout of 75% of annual net income for 2016. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.59 million barrels per day to 1.64 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 barrels per day to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 260,000 barrels per day to 280,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 barrels per day to 470,000 barrels per day. Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel for the second quarter. Based on today's market prices, we expect costs relating to meeting our biofuel blending obligations to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. This is primarily related to RINs in the U.S. The ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for depreciation and amortization. G&A expenses for the second quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be approximately $165 million and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at $465 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be 31%. This concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we respectfully request that callers limit each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their question. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. From Goldman Sachs, we have Neil Mehta. Please go ahead, sir. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Neil. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Joe, you made reference to seeing opportunities in the M&A market in your opening comments. Of course, recognize that you can't comment on anything specific but can you talk about either scale, large-scale or small-scale, or whether those opportunities are more midstream-focused versus refining focused? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Neil, I'll provide some color here in a second, but let me let Mike go ahead and speak to this. Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Neil, we're looking at the opportunities that are available to us both on the refining and the midstream side. We do have a target list as Joe alluded in his comments. Some of those are corporate-related, some of those are asset-related. So, I can't provide any more specifics than that at this point. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know, Neil, when we look at these though, I mean obviously you want to try to find opportunities where you can buy good assets and where you can achieve synergies in it. And that's certainly true on the refining side. I'll just be honest right now, there's not a whole lot that's being shown to us, but we do have our target list and there are a few conversations that are taking place. Then on the M&A side, it's like Mike said, I think if you think in terms of the type of deal we're going to do, it's not likely going to be some kind of large corporate deal. It's not going to be a step-out deal, but it will be more asset-focused and perhaps in the context of a partnering arrangement with people that were looking at transactions or want somebody to share in their pipe. So nothing super hot right now, though. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate that, guys. And then secondly, on the distillate market, you made a reference to the fact that it is tough out there in terms of the margins for distillates. And part of that was weather, but part of it seems to be both supply and demand for the product. How do you see that going forward through the balance of the year and then can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the export market for distillate and if that's ultimately the flywheel that can help rebalance the market? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Okay, Neil. This is Gary. Yeah, I think what we've seen on distillate, we came out of winter with a lot of overhang in distillate inventory as you alluded to. And then on the demand side, you get into March and demand was way off and we've certainly seen for the past several weeks, demand continue to creep up. We've seen some good agricultural demand begin to kick in and so we've trended to where we're now more towards the five-year high, actually last week above the five-year high. So I think some of this demand will help clean up the inventory. And then also, you talked about the exports. We're seeing lot of good opportunities to export distillate as well, so the combination of the two of those things, I think, will help keep domestic inventories in check. Moving forward, I think as flat price continues to rise, you'll start to see some recovery in the upstream sector, which should improve distillate demand as well. But really we'll have to wait and see if we have a more normal winter this winter and that'll be a key driver in terms of what happens with the distillate fracks moving forward. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thanks, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Neil. Operator : From Howard Weil, we have Blake Fernandez. Please go ahead. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Hey, guys. Good morning. I was hoping to get a little color on your thoughts around the drop-down targets. I believe you have a $1 billion target. I think year-to-date you've done about $240 million, but just in light of kind of some of the challenges we're seeing in the midstream, can you just share your thoughts around how you're thinking about that $1 billion target this year? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Blake, sure. This is Mike. Before we get into that target, though, let me start off by talking about the capital markets. VLP does not need to execute any drops to meet its 25% distribution growth through 2017. So VLP does not need to access the capital markets. That being said, we believe the capital markets, both debt and equity, are open for MLPs, particularly high-quality MLPs like VLP. The cost of issuing debt or equity, however, remains more expensive than historical levels. The good news was VLP is well positioned with strong distribution coverage and does not need access to the capital markets from this price environment. Therefore, we are going to revise our drop-down guidance to $500 million to $750 million. We can execute drops in this range without going to the capital markets. We are going to continue to prepare for $1 billion in drops and will be ready to execute $1 billion in drops if the capital markets improve. From a Valero Energy perspective, regardless of whether or not we drive $500 million or $1 billion worth of assets this year to VLP, this amount will not materially change our view on our payout guidance. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Got it. Okay. Thank you, Mike. That's helpful. The second question and this may tie in a little bit with Neil's M&A question, but the amount of, I guess, capital returned to shareholders, $547 million, is well above your adjusted earnings, so you're obviously well on track with that net income target. Obviously 1Q is a little weak, so maybe you see some improving earnings going forward? But I'm just curious if you were to identify some M&A opportunities, does that materially change your thought on this 75% net income target? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would only say that we would have to look at that at the time of the acquisition. I mean, if it was a huge acquisition that might require some equity, then obviously we'd have to rethink about the buyback target. But it's going to be \u2013 right now I'm going to say no, but depending on the size of it, it could. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : From Barclays, we have Paul Cheng. Please go ahead, sir. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I think the first one is for Joe and maybe then for Mike actually. On the financial strategy, I mean are you guys actively looking at and evaluating opportunity on M&A? From that standpoint, Mike and Joe, should we be more maybe conservative on the bond shape and maybe put some of the free cash flow back on the cash so that you will be ready when the opportunities strike? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Our balance sheet, Paul, is very, very strong. We want to keep it that way, but it's very strong. I think right now rather than building cash, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to grow our business and our EPS. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And, you know, Paul, I mean you saw the cash balance that we've got. As Mike said, our leverage levels are very low. We came through a tough quarter with this balance sheet. So I think we are pretty well positioned and I would tell you, though, if there was a significant M&A transaction out there, we would do the right thing as you would expect us to do and perhaps build some cash before we executed the transaction. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. The second question, maybe this is for either Gary or Lane. In the first quarter, your system-wide margin capture rate versus your benchmark is about 62%. In the first quarter last year, it's about 70%, and your average in 2015, 2014 is about 72% and 67%. So, just curious that in the first quarter this year, there much lower margin capture rate. How much is related to just the different pricing environment in the macro fund and how much is related to more company-specific reason? Any kind of insight would be great. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Hey, Paul, this is Gary. I can start with, I guess it's hard to go into a lot of detail on the capture rates here, so certainly invite you to follow up with Karen and John after the call, but on some high-level things, I can tell you in terms of volume variance, there really wasn't a negative impact on volume variance for refineries. Actually, we would show that the volume variance was slightly positive for the quarter. So, what you are seeing on the capture rates is all market-driven. At a high level, there's a few things I would point to. The higher cost RINs certainly had an impact on our capture rates. The butane differential, the gasoline was much more narrow in the first quarter than what we saw last year that had an impact on the capture rates. In the North Atlantic basin, when you look at our crude cost relative to Brent, the narrower Brent-TI arb impacted our crude cost most importantly at Qu\u00e9bec. Also the Western Canadian crudes, the Syncrudes were more expensive in the first quarter, so the volumes coming off Line 9, so we had a crude cost impact to our North Atlantic basin system. And the only thing that's really operationally we had the Benecia cat down on the West Coast for a planned turnaround, and so our capture rates there were down a little bit as well, but those are some of the real key factors. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Gary, can I have a quick follow-up. On the second quarter, your turnaround activity, is it focusing on the conversion unit or that is crude unit? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Hey, Paul, this is Lane. We don't give second quarter guidance with respect to what kind of capacity we'll have in turnaround, so. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Will do. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Paul. Operator : From JPMorgan, we have Phil Gresh. Please go ahead. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Phil. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question on the Gulf Coast, your crude slate clearly shifted more towards mediums. On your slide deck, you have given a range historically for heavies of about 24% to 37% over time, and you were at the low end of that range 24% in the first quarter. That's actually down year-over-year, so I know you talked about the medium and heavy discounts becoming available. Were there any one-time factors that led you to have actually lower heavies in the quarter or just generally how are you thinking about crude slate as we progress through the year? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, Phil, this is Gary. A couple of things, the way we report our results, we have the heavy sour crudes shown, but we also have a category we show resids, and some of those resids are actually replacements for heavy sour crudes in our system. We run the resids through our crude unit, and so where the heavy sour crudes were down, actually the resids we processed were up. So there really wasn't a significant difference in the amount of heavy sour crude we ran in the first quarter. In terms of the range, some of the things that we talk about, it's not just the discounts that we are looking at, there is a rate lever associated with really pushing heavy sour crudes in our system. If we want to maximize heavy sour crudes, they generally mean we are running at lower throughput, so we have to look at the discounts and also where the crack spreads are, and then we do that optimization. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. Follow-up question just on the M&A front. With respect to refining to the extent you are looking there, could you just remind us how you think about regionally where you'd want to be adding exposure? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I mean, if you look at areas that we feel that we could grow, okay, and I'm doing this from just historical looks at different assets and how the FTC might view something, the West Coast, California in particular, will be very, very difficult for us. We are not really focused there. The East Coast, we've exited and so we're not interested there. The Mid-Con, I think we would be good to go on transactions and we'd be interested in there and then of course U.S. Gulf Coast. And when we look at the acquisitions, we look at them from a perspective of where can we create the greatest synergies. And with the portfolio of assets that we have in the U.S. Golf Coast, we believe that we can create synergies around feedstocks and product movements there perhaps better than anywhere else now. So, that would be the U.S. side. If we go over to Europe, I think we'd be interested in assets in markets like the UK where we've got a presence today and we could bolt something on and support it out of the London office. We're not interested in a lot of the countries in Western Europe just because of the nature of the assets and then the issues that go along with owning assets in those markets. And then I really think from our perspective, the Far East is off the table. So, in a nutshell, the U.S. Gulf Coast would be interesting, the Mid-Continent of the U.S. would be interesting, the UK would be interesting, and that would be our primary focus. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just sneak one last one in on RINs? Do you have what the actual RINs cost was in the first quarter of this year relative to first quarter of last year? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we probably do. Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, $161 million versus $133 million last year. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Take care, Phil. Operator : From Wells Fargo, we have Roger Read. Please go ahead, sir. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I guess let me jump into the gasoline demand, obviously positive comments to start it off. Now that we're getting into the early part of summer driving season, summer grade gasoline, how is the octane market shaping up? Are we seeing significant supplies, any shortages in any particular regions? And just how you look at that as we roll through the rest of the second quarter? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Hey, Roger. This is Gary. I think we're seeing a very similar situation in regards to octane what we've seen the last couple of years. Octane's starting to get tight, so we saw the regrade in the Mid-Continent strengthen significantly. The premium regrade on the West Coast has also strengthened considerably in the last couple of weeks, so I think the industry's short of octane and we'll see similar regrades to what we've been seeing in the past few years. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, no reason to think there's any sort of surplus octane out there at all at this point? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : It doesn't appear that way to me. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on your comment on the diesel demand side, underpinned by the agricultural seasonality. I assume that backs off somewhat as we roll into the middle of the summer. Do you see any other places in the market where demand has picked up or has at least solidified versus where it was in the wintertime? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : I think going forward the thing we're looking at is our exports. And so you look to us and yesterday the JBC global refining margin showed Northwest Europe simple capacity at like $0.23 margin, so it doesn't take diesel falling off much before some of that low complexity capacity has to cut and as they cut, it'll open up even greater opportunities for us to export our barrels moving forward. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's great. Thank you. Operator : From Wolfe Research, we have Paul Sankey. Please go ahead, sir. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, everyone. I'm not quite sure what I was called just there and I'm not going to repeat it. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Paul, it's better than probably some of the things you've been called. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks, Joe. Appreciate that. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Just kidding. (30:42) All right, Paul. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Joe, you came in as CEO very clearly talking about cash return, a big jump in the dividend. I'm not quite sure why today you're suddenly saying you're going to buy stuff. If I missed something, is that mostly for VLP that you're talking about or is this a change in tone? And further to that, the macro follow-up, it seems like we got a really good environment in terms of demand and everything else out there, particularly for you guys with the heavy/light spreads and stuff, heavy sour. Why are margins not better and is that related to oversupply, do you think, which would further underline that you wouldn't want to be growing in this market? You would want to be shrinking. Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Well, I'll go first. You know, Paul, I'd say M&A is something that we've had in our capital allocation framework for the last two years and that really hasn't changed. Now it seems like you and your peers are the ones that are interested in that perhaps more than we are. When we look at our approach to trying to drive EPS growth over the next three years to five years, it's really multifaceted and it includes growth investments in refining and midstream. We also look at M&A and we look at share repurchases and we've got a really good pipeline of refining projects that are under development. Now we don't want to get out over our skis, so we don't really discuss the specifics on these projects that are in development until we've gone further down the approval process. But we do have a bunch of great projects that exceed the 25% IRR hurdle rate that we've talked about and we'll try to do as many of those projects as we find. Midstream investments are of interest. They've got a lower hurdle rate, as you would expect, but they will drive earnings growth through optimization, so these are critical to us also. Then when we look at the discretionary uses of cash, M&A fits into that category for us. And really what I just want to communicate on that is that the assets that we would look at there, Paul, would be those that create synergy and would be accretive to the company. We've got a great portfolio today and we do have that tension between the use \u2013 the discretionary use of cash via this framework that we put in place and we are not going to do an acquisition, and that's why you've seen we haven't pulled the trigger, we're not going to do an acquisition if we believe it's more accretive to do a share repurchase. So anyway return of cash to shareholders hasn't lost its priority at all from our perspective. It's just we are looking at that, growth projects and M&A as a competitive use of funds. So, with that, Gary, you want to answer the (30:47)? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : (30:48) Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Well, I guess, Joe, just to quickly throw in a follow-up. You're still running with the share of net income target paid out, I guess? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Right. That's right. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : And then, do we think \u2013 are we oversupplied in this market? Is that why margins are not better for what should be seemingly a much better environment? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, I think so. You have a couple of key factors. We keep pointing down the distillate side. The warmer weather in the United States and Northwest Europe certainly hindered these demands coming through the winter and so it created this overhang we are living with today. I think the other thing that happened is the combination of relatively strong frack spreads in December and January incentivized higher utilization than what we typically see. In combination, the strong carry in the market and refiners that typically aren't running high utilizations in December and January, running high utilizations and selling their product forward, so those things kind of all contributed to build some inventory and it will just take us a little while to work that inventory off. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood. Very quick follow-up. Could you just update us on the impact what you're seeing in Venezuela in terms of if there is impact there and what sort of lost volumes there are? And I'll leave it at there. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Paul. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, so, Venezuela was very important piece of our crude supply situation. We've had a very good longstanding relationship with PDVSA. What we've seen is we really haven't seen a decrease in oil coming out of the country. What we have seen is with some of the rolling power outages that they've had, that the grades of oil are changing so we are seeing a greater percentage of diluted crude oils and less of some of the synthetic crude oils into our system, but our system is robust enough to be able to absorb that, so we buy those barrels and continue to run them into our system. Operator : From Simmons, we have Jeff Dietert. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jeff. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Joe, in your initial comments, you talked about seeing more medium sours on the market and we are seeing that roll through the DoE statistics historically for January and February. I was hoping you could comment on some of the recent press releases that have highlighted increased supply coming out of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and some of the other Middle Eastern countries. Are you seeing increases of volumes coming from the Middle East coming into the market? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Jeff. Let Gary answer this. He's in the market every day. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, Jeff, so we certainly are seeing that. I think on the Iranian barrels, of course we don't run any Iranian barrels, but what we've seen there is kind of some rebalancing in the market, so some of those barrels are making their way into Europe and we're seeing some of the Russian Urals come back into the U.S. market that we haven't seen here for a while. And then, yes, we are certainly seeing a lot more Saudi barrels flowing this way. We had decreased our Saudi volumes, but as they continue to put barrels on the market and they are competitive, we are ramping those back up on our system as well. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : And are you seeing a shift towards an increase in imported crude versus domestic crude? Just kind of confirming. U.S. Lower 48 volumes down 670,000 barrels a day from peak and imports increasing, it seems most of that is Middle East, LAM, and Canada. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yes, I agree. What you're really seeing is a substitution somewhat of domestic light sweet for Middle East medium sours. We've seen sometimes where the arb is opened to import foreign light sweets, but that doesn't seem open very long. Same way. There is an occasional pop where the market goes, where incentivized exports of U.S. crude, but again that doesn't seem to last very long. The big switch has been a domestic light sweet for a Middle East medium sour. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Thanks for your comments. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : From Citigroup, we have Faisel Khan. Please go ahead. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah, good morning, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi Faisel. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Just two questions. First on the gasoline margins, the realized margins between the Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic \u2013 or sorry, Mid-Continent, if I look at the markers for the quarter, certainly in the Mid-Continent, the diesel and gasoline minus TI margins were higher than the Gulf Coast gasoline and ULSD minus Brent margins, but the realized margins in the Gulf Coast are much higher, so I just want to make sure I understand sort of what's taking place there with the Gulf Coast realized margins being higher versus the Mid-Continent despite the product market being more profitable in the Mid-Continent, and I know you guys had some run cuts. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : So, are you looking on a comparative basis quarter-over-quarter or are you just...? Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): No. Just in the quarter between regions. The Mid-Continent gasoline minus TI crack was stronger than the Gulf Coast gasoline minus Brent crack, but on a realized basis, it was still much stronger in the Gulf Coast than the Mid-Continent. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, so, I would say probably the key thing that contributed to that is that the Mid-Continent just had very, very high inventories. And so, in order to move product out over our wholesale racks, we were actually having to discount product in order to clear the refineries and so it lowered our realized kind of crack capture. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that makes sense. And then on light/heavy differentials, it looks like recently, just in the last week or two, the differentials sort of narrowed a little bit. Just wondering what you're seeing there despite sort of the talk of more availability of heavy sour crudes in the market. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, I think the thing that happened there is really the K and the Maya formula changed, and at the same time it changed, the Brent-TI arb came in and fuel oil strengthened a little bit, and so it really made it to where Maya isn't pricing competitive with medium sour alternatives or really even pricing competitive with Canadian alternatives into the Gulf, which tells me the Maya formula is going to have to change again and the Maya discount will have to widen going forward. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Makes sense. Thanks for the time, guys. Operator : From Tudor, Pickering, Holt, we have Chi Chow on the line. Please go ahead. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Chi. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi. Your throughput guidance for 2Q felt a little bit light across all the regions. Was that turnaround-related or more economic-related decisions? John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Yeah, Chi, this is John. We can't talk about forward turnarounds, but I mean we take a view of turnaround activity and then also markets to plan our throughputs. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then I am not exactly sure this is an M&A question specifically or more a broader U.S. market question, but it feels like the breakup of Motiva is potentially a significant development in the domestic downstream market. Kind of how do you assess these opportunities and maybe even the risk associated with that event? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, okay. I don't know that I've assessed it the way you're asking. I mean we understand that they had a partnership that they wanted to both exit and they decided to do that. I think Saudi is pleased with the assets that they got in the deal and Shell is pleased with the assets that they have in the deal, and that's really all we know about that one to be quite honest. I do not view this transaction, though, as a precursor to a whole series of other major similar type of transactions in the U.S., Chi. I just don't \u2013 we're not hearing it and we're not seeing it. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Do you think Aramco is looking to take more refining capacity here? And will the government even allow that, do you think? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I can't \u2013 I'd only be speculating and I really don't have an opinion on it. Again, I think they'd have to find something that was for sale if they wanted to engage and I just don't know if there's a significant portfolio of assets out there that they could get into. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Well, thanks, Joe. Appreciate that. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Sorry, Chi. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yeah, no. It's... Operator : From Cowen & Company, we have Sam Margolin. Please go ahead. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: So, on U.S. crude exports, you touched on it for a second, windows not open all that often. But you're still seeing some upstream companies talk about it. There've been a couple of press releases. Have you seen any effect? And I ask in the context of the Corpus Christi topper, which sounds like it had a pretty good result in the quarter and doesn't seem really affected by either diffs or single cargoes exiting the Gulf whenever temporary windows open. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, this is Gary again. I don't think we've really seen any significant impact of the exports on any of our operations. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And that's sort of like \u2013 so the topper performance is essentially in line, you think, sort of operating with expectations in the current environment? Are there any commodity factors that are dynamic that affect that, if it's not differentials? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Hey, Sam. This is Lane. We started up in December our funding investment decision, which was about $150 million of EBITDA. If you use 2015 pricing, it made about $200 million and if you look at the last quarter, we're estimating it contributed about $35 million. So it's in line with our funding decision, and then Gary spoke to the market on it, so that's where the project sort of fits. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Any other factors that are affecting it? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Well, you have commodity risk all over the place. I think when we analyze a project, the one that we always stare at the most is naphtha. The Gulf has long naphtha with crude in it backed out resid purchases and so we always have a keen eye on the placement of naphtha that's created due to both of these projects, both the Corpus Christi and the Houston crudes. That's where I would say the greatest commodity risk is. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And I hate to harp on M&A because I recognize the opportunity to give color is limited, but I just wanted to touch on something you said about the Gulf Coast and ask about any regulatory elements we should know about. It sounds if the FTC is sort of pretty generous with these market share requirements or if it would be a little tougher? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know, Sam, I never really heard anybody use generous and FTC in the same context, but I would describe them as a very reasonable group quite honestly and we've had a lot of dealings with them over the years as we've done acquisitions. I believe that what they would look at not only for Valero but for anybody is your ability to restrict trade in a particular market. And because the Gulf Coast is so long and so oversupplied and the barrels tend to move throughout the U.S. and abroad, you're not going to run into a situation whereby having a more significant concentration in the Gulf Coast, you could run into a situation where you could manipulate markets, it just wouldn't be possible. So, anyway, I really don't think they'd have a problem with additional Gulf Coast exposure for Valero. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks so much. Operator : From Credit Suisse, we have Ed Westlake. Please go ahead. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, guys. Good morning. A couple of small ones. Just on the comment you said seeing a lot more OPEC barrels coming this way, is that a recent change or is that just a general comment around sort of the first quarter and market conditions? I'm just specifically thinking about the failure of Doha and whether that has sort of brought any more assertiveness into the marketing of these barrels to you given you're a big medium and heavy consumer? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : I think we have seen a strategic shift that the Saudis have made an effort to regain the market share they lost to a lot of the domestic crude producers and they're exporting a lot more barrels to the U.S. Gulf Coast, and we certainly saw that in the first quarter and we expect it will continue. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Just then on the Gulf Coast, I mean you've got these toppers coming up, so that's adding to capacity and yet your sort of guidance was just a little bit soft. I mean just maybe is it the startup of those CDUs within the quarter? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Throughput guidance. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Throughput guidance, yeah. R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: So, Ed, I'll take a stab at this. I mean John sort of alluded to it. There's an \u2013 they're \u2013 both of the crude units are running in \u2013 the Corpus Christi crude unit is running in the second quarter and the Houston crude unit starts up in the second quarter. All the rest of the volume guidance is related to other activities and with our market outlook and the capacity that we plan to run with. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then on the RIN size, just we've obviously got the costs and we'll do the calculation, but are you drawing down any inventories? I mean folks are getting perhaps even more concerned about RIN prices into 2017 given the mandate and where your inventory position of the refining industry will be. Obviously there's an election between now and then, but maybe some color as to what \u2013 if everything was unchanged, what sort of inflation you might see in that RIN cost into 2017? Martin Parrish - Vice President- Alternative Fuels : Yeah, this is Martin Parrish. I think a lot of it \u2013 there's quite a bit of stock to pull down on the RIN, so we'll see it and we still don't have clear sight of what's going to be called for in 2017. So I think right now it's a little early to say. It's been kind of remarkably stable for the last few months, RIN prices, so we'll see. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And then final small one, you mentioned that you thought the waterborne octane components have been cleared up at this point. Maybe just some extra color, I mean we do hear anecdotes of (44:30) cargoes floating around, which would make limited sense to me. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah. So we heard the same thing, that there was a lot of cargoes, especially parked off New York Harbor. Our understanding is a lot of that has actually come in over the last couple of weeks. And as I mentioned, we're actually seeing the premium regrade start to widen, which kind of contradicts this idea that there is all this octane laying around. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. And typically it widens more in May, so we'll watch that closely. Okay. Thanks very much. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Ed. Operator : From RBC Capital Markets, we have Brad Heffern. Please go ahead. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, everyone. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Brad. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Joe and I guess maybe for Gary too, in the opening remarks, you talked about how strong export \u2013 or product export demand has continued to be. Can you dive a little more into that? Have there been any changes in terms of where that demand is coming from and I'm sort of asking about specifically in the context of what seems to be weaker Latin American growth? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, Brad, this is Gary. So in the first quarter, we did 249,000 barrels a day of diesel. If you include jet and kerosene with that, we're up to 295,000 barrels a day. That was split with about 80% going to Latin America, 20% to Europe. During the first quarter, the arb to Europe was closed most of the first half of the first quarter. It opened back up and has remained opened, so I think you'll see a little more volume going to Europe but we're still seeing very good Latin America demand for diesel as well moving forward. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Mike. Thinking about the cadence of CapEx, the first quarter number looked pretty light relative to where I expected it to be. And certainly on a run rate basis, it's not particularly close to the $2.6 billion annual guidance. Is there a reason to think that the CapEx is going to pick up throughout the year or are you guys running ahead? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right now, the $2.6 billion is what we have in our forecast. On an annualized basis, obviously we're way short of that, but we're okay on the forecast. R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Hey, Brad. This is Lane. I'll give a little color on that. I mean the first quarter's always a little bit of a challenge. You're coming out of the holidays and you have weather to contend with. And so the first quarter for us, at least seasonally, is always light with respect to our CapEx. We'll spend some \u2013 we'll spend more than the run rate \u2013 than that rate second quarter and third quarter, and then it slows down again in the fourth quarter. And so that's where I would say the seasonality of the CapEx has been for our company. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. Operator : From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we have Doug Leggate. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Oh, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if I was going to get squeezed in there or not. How're you doing, Joe? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good, Doug. You? Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Not too bad. Thank you. I got a couple; one micro and one specific. I guess it's a follow-up to Brad's question. Last year when margins, gasoline in particular, was extraordinary strong at the beginning of the year, European refiners were running pretty hard. And I guess that, that dynamic is changing quite a bit. Given your European footprint or your Pembroke exposure, I'm just curious as to what you're seeing there. Is the distillate market starting to tighten up a little bit, at least in terms of what your prior comments were about the potential for export reopening? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, so we've seen the arb to export diesel to Europe open since midway through the first quarter. It remains open today and we are seeing good demand for European quality distillate in our system. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So I guess what I'm getting at, are you seeing refinery runs \u2013 is that translating to lower production in the region? At least that's what we're seeing. I just wanted to see if it was showing up on your markets as well locally. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, so I think what you're \u2013 at least my view of where they are in Northwest Europe, the refineries that are cutting are primarily refineries that are producing fuel oil because fuel oil is so discounted today. Pembroke is a pretty high conversion refinery, so we're seeing production remain very high at Pembroke. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Two quick follow-ups, if I may. So the first one, I'm afraid, is M&A as well. Just very curious, Joe, you mentioned Europe. I mean European markets traditionally have not been anywhere near as seasonal or healthy, if you like, as the U.S. How would you characterize the opportunity set that you see there or was it just a passing comment? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's more of a passing comment. I would say very limited. But I don't want to tell you we would never look at a UK refinery and then we show up in some point in time and do it, and you remind me of it. But I mean, Doug, you know those markets. I mean frankly, we've said this for years that \u2013 and we got a gem in Pembroke. And back to your first question, all the diesel that's produced at Pembroke moves inland, most of the gasoline. And so we've got a fairly unique footprint there in that we're able to supply the domestic markets in Ireland in a very efficient way. So we really like that. We could find a similar type of asset in a market that was similar, okay, and when I say that, I really am thinking primarily of the UK. Well, I think we'd consider it. Now, are we having active conversations on anything like that? No. But would we want to move into France, Spain, Italy or the Med? The answer would be no. So it's more of a passing comment. But we tell you guys we're looking at everything that's out there and we do that because we're always looking for opportunities to continue to grow the EPS. But again, we're very pleased with the portfolio that we have and we can create significant income with it. So we don't feel desperate to do anything in that M&A market. Certainly, again, it's in competition for all the other good uses of cash that we have. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Unrelated, I guess my follow-up is for Mike. Mike, the tax \u2013 or the cash received for the drop-down relative to the price agreed. How should we think about the after-tax proceeds versus your slightly lower drop-down target? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would think, I mean we're going to continue to look at each of the drops, as we come up on them in this course, as far as how we want the financing we do to mitigate taxes. I think it would probably be on this next drop similar of a cash tax \u2013 after-tax cash as (50:58). Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know, Doug, looking longer term and this is just the reality of it, a lot of the logistics assets that would be dropped are going to \u2013 they got zero tax basis, and so I think for a long time when everybody was looking at 10-time multiples, 11-time multiples on these drop transactions with all that cash flowing back in, we were really overstating the actual cash that would be coming back into the sponsor, and so the reality of it is we are not changing the portfolio of assets that we have to drop. We're really looking at the drop structure and doing it as efficiently as we can. Again, Mike mentioned earlier that we think the capital markets are certainly there, but it's a little bit expensive to go to the public markets today. We don't have a gun to our head to do something because we've got the distribution covered for two years with the cash flow stream that we have today. And all the things that you mentioned earlier, I think we are in a very, very strong position here and we can take our time and time to market and be patient in doing this and whether we do $500 million or $750 million now and then we will start talking about next year what we are going to do, we are going to continue to grow the LP, we are going to continue to drop, I think we're just waiting to see if things don't improve a bit and certainly higher crude prices should take some of this pressure off if we see the crude markets move up and we should be in a good place going forward. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Appreciate all your comments, Joe, and your patience with all our M&A questions this morning. Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No problem. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Locke for closing remarks. John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Bianca. We appreciate you all for joining us today. Please contact me or Karen Ngo if you have additional questions after the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Dounis - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Welcome to the Valero Energy Corporation Reports 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. My name is Vanessa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Good morning. And welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you've not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our investor relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention now to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under the federal securities laws. There're many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks, John, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, we continue to face a challenging margin environment, which was further complicated by high compliance cost headwinds, but our team performed well, running safely and reliably while maintaining our cost-efficient operations. Turning to the markets, sweet crude discounts in the second quarter remained narrow as shale crude production continued to slow. Unplanned crude production outages caused by wildfires in Canada led to the tightening of medium and heavy sour crude discounts relative to Brent. More recently, with the resumption of crude production in Canada and the continued flow of foreign medium sour crudes to the U.S. Gulf Coast, we've seen discounts widening versus Brent. We expect medium, heavy and sour crude oils to remain attractive. On the products side, margins improved compared to the first quarter, and product demand in domestic and export markets remain robust. In fact, we exported record volumes of distillate and gasoline combined for the second quarter. Turning to our refining growth strategy, we successfully commissioned the new Houston crude unit in June. In addition, the Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, ran well at above planned rates. We continued engineering and procurement work on the $300 million Houston alkylation unit, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2019. We also continued to develop other strategic projects that will provide octane enhancement, feedstock flexibility and cogeneration to create higher value products and reduce cost. Also in June, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Parkway Pipeline, which connects our St. Charles refinery to the Plantation pipeline. With 100% ownership interest in this pipeline and the planned connection to the Colonial pipeline, we've enhanced our product supply options to the U.S. East Coast. This transaction fits our strategy to optimize through investments in logistics assets, which we expect to be eligible for future drop to Valero Energy Partners LP, our sponsored MLP. With respect to VLP, last week we announced the distribution increase of 7.4% for the second quarter, which keeps us on pace for an annual distribution growth rate of 25%. And finally, despite the lower margin environment, we generated solid cash flow from operations and stepped up our return of cash to stockholders through our buyback program. So, with that, John, I'll hand it back over to you. John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Thank you, Joe. For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $814 million or $1.73 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.66 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding an after-tax lower of cost or market inventory valuation benefit of $367 million or $0.78 per share and an asset impairment loss of $56 million or $0.12 per share, second quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $503 million or $1.07 per share. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on page three of the financial tables that accompany our release. Operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of 2016 was $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income was $954 million, which was $1.2 billion lower than the second quarter of 2015. Primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins, due to lingering high product inventories and lower discounts for sweet crude oils relative to Brent crude oil. Higher RIN prices also created additional earnings headwinds in the second quarter of 2016. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day in the second quarter of 2016, which was in line with the second quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 94% throughput capacity utilization, which was impacted by a turnaround at our Texas City refinery. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.51 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 were $0.15 per barrel lower compared to the second quarter of 2015, largely driven by lower energy costs. The ethanol segment generated $69 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2016, and adjusted operating income of $49 million, which was $59 million lower than in the second quarter of 2015, due primarily to lower gross margin per gallon driven by higher corn prices in the second quarter of 2016. Additionally for the second quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $159 million and net interest expense was $111 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $471 million and the effective tax rate was 26% in the second quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower than expected and lower than in the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to the positive change in the company's lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve in the second quarter of 2016, which contributed to a stronger relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $7.5 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.9 billion, of which $67 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 21%. We had $5.3 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $436 million was only available to VLP. We generated $2.3 billion of cash from operating activities in the second quarter. Of which, $1.3 billion was due to favorable working capital changes, primarily increases in accounts and taxes payable and a reduction in inventories. With regard to investing activities, we made $461 million of capital investments, of which $164 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. This amount excludes our purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Parkway Pipeline from Kinder Morgan. Moving to financing activities, we returned $683 million in cash to stockholders in the second quarter, which included $282 million in dividend payments and $401 million for the purchase of over 7.5 million shares of Valero common stock. As of June 30, we had approximately $700 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. For 2016, we expect to invest $1.6 billion to maintain the business, and another $1 billion for refining asset optimization and logistics projects, which are expected to drive long-term earnings growth. For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.6 million barrels per day to 1.65 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 415,000 barrels per day to 435,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 260,000 barrels per day to 280,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 460,000 barrels per day to 480,000 barrels per day. The guidance range for the U.S. Gulf Coast reflects the previously announced major turnaround at the Port Arthur refinery, which occurs once every five years. Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.70 per barrel in the third quarter. We continue to expect costs related to meeting our biofuel blending obligations, primarily related to RINs in the U.S., to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. Costs will likely end up in the upper end of that range based on recent RIN prices. The ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. G&A expenses for the third quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be around $180 million and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $465 million and our effective tax rate should be around 30%. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we ask that callers adhere to our protocol in the Q&A to two questions. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their question. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Operator : And thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. Congrats on the strong cash flow quarter here. Want to kick it off on the product side. Clearly, product margins are a concern for investors as we think about both the refining stocks and then also as we think about the flat price per crude. So, two questions on that basis. One, Joe, do you think there's just too much refining capacity in the world here? Is there a structural oversupply in capacity? And then, do you expect that we're going to see run cuts this fall here in the U.S. or elsewhere in the world? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Neil, and thanks for your comments. Why don't I let Gary take a crack at this? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, Neil. I think despite the fact that we've seen very strong product demand, obviously, the refinery utilization has been such that supply has been able to keep up and even outpace demand. So, ultimately, we're going to need a rebalancing and see lower refinery utilization moving forward. So, I do believe that you'll see some refinery run cuts as we head into the third quarter and fourth quarter. I think that some of what happened this year is that with the steep contango in the market, especially early in the year, some marginal refining capacity that typically you would see cut in the winter had incentive to go ahead and run and produce the summer grade of gasoline. And so, it caused utilization to be very high, especially like in the January, February timeframe. And that's where we built the large overhang of products that we've really had to manage the rest of this year. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate those comments. And then secondly, on RINs here, you maintained the guidance of $750 million to $850 million, but is it fair to say there's some upward bias to the midpoint of the range? Joe, can you just talk about what you ultimately see as the resolution to this RINs issue? I know it's something that you've been talking to the EPA about quite a lot. And then just how you see the RINs issue evolving from here. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Neil. That's a good question. And I'll speak just briefly about the lawsuit really, and then if we have procedural questions, Jay can help me with that. But our action with the EPA is really focused on dealing with the current structure of the system. The current system, as you know, misaligns the RIN obligation with the ability to comply by blending. So, what's happened, it's enabled speculators to drive up RIN prices, which really distorts the markets. And it facilitates opportunities for RIN fraud, which we've seen a fair amount of. Moving to point of obligation really would address these issues, and then it would enable the penetration of biofuel products into the marketplace to increase their blending. So, that's really the emphasis for us on trying to push this just to try to fix a structure that we think really is misaligned and infeasible today. And then, Jay, on process, any comments? Jay D. Browning - Executive Vice President & General Counsel : Yeah. As everyone knows, if you're engaged in litigation we're only in a position to control our own efforts and timing. And we are doing everything possible that we can to bring attention to the issue. We have filed the lawsuits, we filed the petition for reconsideration, and we've engaged in a lot of effort to educate other affected parties as well as EPA officials. Ideally, we would like to see EPA of its own accord engage in a rulemaking process. And if they were to do so, you can go to the EPA website and see basically how long it takes for them to put out a proposed rule, gather comments and finalize a rule. Short of that, we're having to fall back on timing of the process of litigation, which is very difficult to speculate. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right, guys. Thanks for the comments. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Neil. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Evan. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, I know you guys raised your dividend early in the first quarter and your indicative yield today is higher than it was in 2008 and 2009. Can you discuss how you stress the dividend when you establish or decide to raise that earlier this year and how you view the sustainability of your yield? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay, Evan. Our dividend is a commitment to our shareholders and we do consider it non-discretionary. With our cash position and nearly $5 billion of liquidity we have available to us, we're quite comfortable with the sustainability of our current dividend and also the payout target of at least 75% of net income. And in addition, we're not concerned with the funding of our capital program. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And Evan, we did take a good hard look at this. And obviously margins can be volatile, right? That's a understatement for the year. Last year they were strong, this year they're weaker. And so, we ran cases before we presented to the board the dividend increase, which really looked at different margin scenarios. And that's how we got our comfort level with it. I mean, we stressed it pretty hard. And, obviously, in this low-margin environment and with earnings where they are, we're still in a good position on the dividend. So, obviously, we did a thorough job on that. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. No, that makes sense. And that should help support in this environment, your stock. Maybe a follow-up on the distribution comment. I mean, you're running above the 75% payout target year-to-date in 2Q. How should we think about that target going forward and does the higher distribution reflect your view on an improving outlook or the cash generating abilities of your assets? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Our target is based on net income, but we do understand in this lower earnings environment that we have to consider our cash flow generating capabilities and then also the drops to the VLP. So through June, we have paid out 156% of adjusted net income and that's about 42% of our cash flow. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Appreciate it, guys. John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Good. Thanks, Evan. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Couple question. Mike, do you have any preliminary 2017, 2018 CapEx that you can share? And if the margins stay close to where we are over the next one or two years, then, how quickly you can adjust those number? Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay, Paul. We haven't disclosed our 2017 capital budget yet. But notionally, we're going to be spending $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion on maintenance capital and roughly $1 billion on growth. Obviously, there's more flexibility in the growth category, but the projects that we're identifying are attractive, and you'd want us to complete these at those rates, at those hurdle rate. So, today we have lots of cash like I just mentioned, and a lot of liquidity and we're quite comfortable in funding our capital expenditures at those levels. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Joe, just curious then, with the refining market, I think, weaker than people expected. When you're looking at the M&A market, have you seen any change in the (20:02) in the last several months? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Paul, I would tell you, I don't think we've seen any major change. I mean, obviously, in a down market if seller doesn't want to sell for what the valuations might be, and a buyer doesn't want to pay for assets based on what we've experienced in the past. And so, it's always a negotiation when you're looking at it. But you raised the question on M&A, and if I could, I just want to stress the fact that M&A is a component of our capital allocation framework, it is not the component of our capital allocation framework. And unfortunately, in our last call, we gave the impression that there was a greater emphasis on M&A than there had been in the past, which we really never intended to do. We've consistently shared that we look at opportunities all the time. So, a transaction like the Parkway Pipeline acquisition wouldn't come as a surprise. But any M&A transactions will need to compete for cash with our growth capital projects and our buybacks. So, just to be clear, there's no greater emphasis on M&A today than there was two years ago. And our commitment to the other components of our capital allocation framework is really unchanged. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Gresh from JPMorgan. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just following up on the CapEx side of things. You're tracking well below for the full year. Were you always expecting to be a little bit more back half loaded because of the turnarounds, or would you say maybe there is some degree of conservatism in the capital budget outlook being maintained in the $2.6 billion for the year? John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Well, we are tracking a little bit below the $2.6 billion. I mean, Lane, do you have any idea on the timing of some of these projects? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Yeah. What I would say, with what we've disclosed and we have a large turnaround at Port Arthur in the third quarter and fourth quarter, that's obvious. That's a big, big turnaround and that is a known quantity. In terms of our, sort of, ratable spend, I would say we're still holding for this $2.6 billion, but we'll see, because, in terms of capital projects, the ratability is such that November, December it's difficult to spend a lot of money during that time of year. So, and I'll just leave it at that. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, the second question, the return of capital discussion, you mentioned cash available via drops. Some of your peers have been pretty active with capital raises and drops so far this year. Feels like the market is opening up for quality MLPs, maybe with the pull back in oil now maybe a little less, we'll see. But how are you thinking about the back half of the year on this front? John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : As far as the drop? Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. In terms of desire to raise capital and do drops. John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Okay. Right now we have no change to the strategy to grow our LP primarily through the dropdown. We do believe a measured pace is prudent, and our guidance is still $500 million to $750 million that we gave in the first quarter call. We will continue to look at third-party logistics still that support Valero's core business. And again, in regard to the capital markets on the equity side, obviously, they've been improving and they have improved throughout the quarter. Debt markets look very good. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, I guess, we'll continue to keep an eye on it. We're not prepared right now to change what we've shared that we're planning to do. Phil, we're all watching this to see, are we dealing with a new normal or are we dealing with just a spike in the market that was driven by the financial situation we had last year. And so, we'll continue to eyeball it. We've got, again, plenty of assets that we could drop. We got significant EBITDA there. We continue to look for opportunities to grow the LP with potential joint ventures and some smaller acquisitions. But, we're very attentive to it. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I guess, some of the main topics have been hit. If maybe we could dive just a little bit deeper into the concern about run cuts and then maybe the outlook for turnarounds beyond just Port Arthur for you as we're looking into the fall. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Run cuts. John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Yeah. So, I guess, on run cuts, we continue to have margin to run in our system. We feel good about the fact that we have this natural gas advantage and feedstock cost advantage in the Gulf that puts us in a very good position globally in the refining industry. So, we're not feeling any pressure for run cuts, but I do agree that we're going to need some rebalancing in the market. So, going forward, I think you'll see some run cuts in the third quarter and fourth quarter. I'm not sure where those will occur. Probably Northwest Europe and some of them in the northeastern United States where you're already starting to hear some in the press of run cuts in today's market. I'll let Lane comment on the future turnarounds. R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Yeah. Roger, we disclosed the Port Arthur turnaround just because it was so material and we wanted to make sure it was out there. It's not a normal way we communicate in terms of providing any additional information on our forward-looking statements with respect to our turnarounds. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Maybe a broader question about turnarounds and experience where we've had these oversupply situations. Is it Valero's experience or would you say it's maybe the industry broadly that when you have a weak margin environment you'll take advantage of opportunities, given that economic costs are much lower of doing a turnaround, or that maybe you don't try to force product through the non-crude unit, if you have a big crude unit turnaround? Just sort of curious of, do you take advantage in a situation where we've come off several years of high margins and a big economic cost to turnaround. Do you see that \u2013 is that one of the ways the industry sort of corrects the imbalance here? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: So, first, I'll comment on Valero. So, we have a strategy of planning our turnarounds a couple of years in advance and executing our turnarounds as they come up. We have a big system, and we feel like we, by virtue of being disciplined in doing that, we don't try to move our turnarounds based on what prompt economics are. Now, (27:07) rest of the industry, there may be some of that. I can't say that there's not. I'm sure that people are looking at whether the refineries are struggling from a maintenance perspective, they may bring the maintenance forward and just fix whatever it is. And if you want to call that a turnaround you might say that. I would say that's essentially about all that there is. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Good morning everybody. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Joe, I guess, my first one might be for Mike. Mike, I just wonder if you could help us understand the strength of the cash flow in the quarter, just as it relates to reported income and DD&A. It looks like there's some other moving parts in there. And my follow-up is on the industry, please. Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So, on the cash flow, we had a change in cash of building (28:11) cash for the quarter of $1.1 billion. But of that amount, $1.3 million was due to favorable working capital changes. So, we had an increase in our payables and receivables, and you net those together, it's about $600 million benefit. We had an increase in our taxes payable of roughly $300 million and then we decreased our inventories in the quarter by about $300 million. So that nets to the $1.2 billion of working capital benefit. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That helps me close the gap. Thanks. Joe, my follow-up is on, I guess, it's more of a kind of margin question in terms of the octane premium that hasn't appeared to materialize this summer. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, octane enhancement or projects might be something that Valero continues to look at. Is 2016 just a one-off or do you still think that there is going to be a call for increased alkylate production or whatever it happens to be in the future? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Doug. Okay. So, Gary or Lane, you guys want to tag team it? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah. I'll start, Doug, and then let Lane talk about the projects a little bit. So, what we've seen in the market is actually the octane premiums on the West Coast in the Mid-Continent in the Group 3 market have been stronger this year than what they were last year. However, in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the New York Harbor we've seen weaker octane premiums. And so, if you kind of try to get your mind around what's going on, I think a lot of that is the fact that where you really can store gasoline is in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the New York Harbor. So, when we had that steep contango earlier in the year, people were storing gasoline, they were largely storing premium grade summer gasoline and high octane blend components. So, in those markets, in the Harbor and the Gulf Coast, as that inventory's come out, it's kind of caused the premiums to be a little weaker this year than what we saw in the past. However, in the Group 3 market, the West Coast market where you don't have a lot of capabilities to store gasoline, the octane values have actually been stronger than what we saw last year. R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: So, Doug, this is Lane. We still have a strategic view that octane has value. And it's really in the context of Tier 3 is going to destroy a lot of octane. And, of course, the autos, on a go-forward basis, are looking at higher compression engines. So, they may, in fact, want higher octane fuel. And the best way to make that, we believe is, it's finding to find a way to get NGL into the transportation fuel and then convert that to octane. So that's why we like our Houston alkylation project. And with that strategic view, we look at other projects to, if it meets our hurdle rates to produce additional octane in our system. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Appreciate the full answer, guys. That's really helpful. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Hey, guys. Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Question for you. I guess, it's kind of macro and also company specific, but you obviously hit record levels on the export side. At the same time, we're seeing increased gasoline imports into the U.S. And so, I'm just trying to get a sense of exactly what's going on. Is this more of a regional dynamic where Gulf Coast is really sending product to other parts of the world and Europe is basically penetrating the East Coast? Or just basically any color you can give us on that framework. Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, Blake. This is Gary. I think it's exactly what you said. We see, especially on gasoline exports, that we have a competitive advantage going to Mexico and South America. And then largely due to Jones Act shipping, we're not as competitive going to the New York Harbor as maybe Northwest Europe are. So, the natural flow of our barrels is to go south into South America, and there's been an incentive to send barrels from Northwest Europe into the Harbor. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Okay. And just to clarify, is Houston \u2013 the startup of Houston, is that contributing to those exports or is that not really that material in the quarter? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : No, it really didn't have any material impact at all in the quarter. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Okay. And if you don't mind, just a final point of clarity. I know you said on the economic run cuts, you're not necessarily providing, I guess, an outlook on exactly where it would occur, but if I heard the guidance correctly on Mid-Con, it looks like a pretty decent rollover quarter-to-quarter. Would that guidance contemplate any economic run cuts that you're planning to do inland? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Blake, this is Lane. And the way I'll answer that is, today we have positive economics in the Mid-Con. Obviously, the region is landlocked. So, we get into seasonal product containments potentially in sort of the fourth quarter and first quarter if that happens about every year. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert with Simmons & Company. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : My question is on summer grade gasoline. With the gasoline inventory overhang that we've got, are you worried about moving your summer grade gasoline at a premium? Are you concerned that that might compress as we get closer to the end of the summer driving season? We've heard some discussion about already shifting to winter grade gasoline production. Does that make any sense? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, Jeff. This is Gary. I don't think there's really a concern on being able to clear out the overhang of the summer grade spec gasoline and moving it out to the market. And, I guess, to your second comment, yes, we are hearing that there are people starting to put some winter grade gasoline into some of the markets, especially into the Harbor. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : And secondly, you reported, I think, record light product yield gasoline yield. We saw 49.3%, up 1.3% year-on-year. Industry to DOE stats show it up maybe slightly more than that. What would you attribute the increase in gasoline yield to in the second quarter? What were the primary factors? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Hey. So, Jeff, this is Lane. I would say, we've been in a strong maximum gasoline signal for the most part, up until about a month ago. And so, our assets, we just had them pointed to try to make as much gasoline as possible. When you compare it year-over-year, there were times last year we maybe didn't have a strong signal to maximize our reformers as much as we have this year and it's really the naphtha discount. But I would just say that's sort of the year-over-year difference. Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Great. Thanks for your comments. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Good morning. You shouted out on the front page ample supplies of medium and heavy sour crude, obviously which your system can process better than others. Is that a comment about the sort of OPEC barrels? Or are you seeing things like in Venezuela, I mean as they run out of power, are they having to puke out some sort of real heavy rubbish at cheap discounts that you can run and others can't? John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : I think we see good supplies in the Middle East, South America and Canada, as well. I don't know that we've seen a lot in terms of change in behavior from Venezuela. We continue to see good supply and will from Venezuela. The grades are a little bit different, so we see a lot more what we call diluted crude oil, or DCO, and less of some of the synthetic barrels (36:01) that type of thing. That's the only change that we've seen. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Right. But presumably those DCOs, you can run through your system at a better economics than the synthetic barrels? John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Yes, typically. They have more difficulty placing the DCO than they would a synthetic barrel. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That makes sense. Okay, and then a separate question. With the cash pile plus organic free cash flow, we'll obviously see how refining works out in the second half. And your inventory in VLP, a question about sort of how you plan to kind of grow the EBITDA inventory that you could then subsequently drop down into VLP. Obviously, you're doing $500 million to $750 million of dropdowns, but should we think of that number being the same number as how you want to grow the top of the funnel of logistics inventory at the parent? I'm trying to think about sort of medium-term CapEx allocation to logistics. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. No, and that's a good question. So, we have a lot of activity underway right now, both for kind of organic projects, which tend to be smaller in their nature, but also some opportunity to acquire assets, really to extend the supply chain into \u2013 in all of our refineries. And so, Ed, we made it a point really not to get out over our skis and talk about the specific opportunities until we were comfortable how the business case looked and really to firm up the opportunity. But we do have a lot going on. So we are focused on continuing to expand the logistics side of the business, and obviously those assets would be those that support the system would bring to VLP some third party volumes, and then continue to expand the dropdown inventory. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, good morning, everyone. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : I had a couple of questions which actually were the first questions asked about half-an-hour ago. So, I appreciate the details. I was going to ask about RINs. I just wanted \u2013 as a follow-up, is there an alternate strategy if the lawsuit fails? I mean, what really is the next recourse after that? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you know, Paul, the obvious operating strategy is to try to go ahead and continue to find ways to blend more, right? So, expansion of our wholesale marketing business is something that we've got a key eye on. Obviously acquiring terminaling assets would provide that opportunity. And then continuing to try to build the export markets to try to alleviate some of the burden of the RIN. Those are all things that we look at regularly and really ongoing. Other than that, you just continue to bang away on the rock and you try to get people to recognize the fact that the system that we have today is broken, that it is creating windfalls for some and it's creating disadvantages for others, and the playing field isn't level. And I can tell you that based on the conversations that we have, there's an understanding of this issue and there's an understanding that the RFS isn't intending what it was intended to do, which was increase the amount of biofuels blended. And we believe that that's caused by the structural problem that we've talked about earlier. So we're not going to give up the fight. We'll continue to push it, both from a regulatory and a legislative perspective, and then from an operating perspective. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Yep, understood. Good luck with that. And then the other one was again pretty much the first question you answered, which is regarding the market environment. If the demand is higher this year than last year in the U.S., is it a function of extra refineries being added, do you think, globally new capacity? Or is it more that the competitive advantage of the Atlantic Basin non-U.S. refiners has improved and therefore they're running stronger, or I would imagine it's a combination of both, but any sort of market commentary you have on that would be great? Thanks. John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Yeah, I would say a lot of it is really more a result of utilization, especially utilization in periods where typically we see refineries cut. So as I talked about, typically you get refineries cutting in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, and this year we saw refineries running very high utilization rates. And a lot of that was just due to the steep contango that was in the market. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, understood. And then finally from me, the demand side, it seems to be sort of being revised lower in the U.S. Is that a concern for you guys? Do you think that the demand is being overstated or do you really think that this is a supply problem? Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I can just comment on what we're seeing through our wholesale demand domestically, and we're seeing good demand through that wholesale channel. So, year-over-year, our gasoline volumes through wholesale are up 3%, and even on the distillate side, we're moving about 1% more through the wholesale channel of diesel than what we did last year. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Faisel. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, Joe. Just going back to the question that Jeff Dietert asked on the sort of switching from summer grade to winter grade and people already putting gasoline in inventory for the winter. Do you think that's a risk or do you think this is a one-off that hopefully we don't carry this excess inventory from the summer into the winter? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It certainly is a risk. It's always a risk that's out there and will depend on what the market structure is, but I think after we've gone through this period where the market's been weaker this year, I don't think it's as great a risk as what we saw in the winter where people were storing the summer grade. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got you. And then, just with the outages in Canada that we saw over the summer, early in the summer. Have you seen those volumes completely recover and how are you dealing with that disruption, and how is that evolving as production ramps back up for you guys? John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Yeah, so I think for us, on the Canadian heavy side, we pretty much are seeing all the volume back available to us. And the Canadian heavy barrels are being priced very competitively versus either another heavy sour alternative or medium sour alternative. So I would say that we've fully recovered from those fires so far. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks for the time, guys. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Chi. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi, Joe. This question may be the same as Paul's, couple questions ago. But just this RIN issue is kind of cropping back up this year. Do you think there's any vulnerability to the merchant refining model that you have longer term, given the RIN issue or anything else that may be out there? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it would probably be hard to say that the RIN was helpful to the merchant refining model. Okay? Obviously, it's not. But then you get into what are the options for dealing with it, and I think I mentioned those earlier, Chi. Specifically from Valero's perspective, the retail marketing business isn't something that's currently on our radar screen. We believe there's better ways to deal with the issue. And so I really don't have anything to add to that, but I think certainly it's an issue that we're working very hard to deal with because it does. It puts an expense on the merchant refiner that he shouldn't be bearing today. And so that creates a real problem. It creates an unlevel playing field in the marketplace, and that's never good. So, anyway, we'll continue to address it the way we are. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Joe, for those thoughts. Maybe a question on Aruba. There's been a lot of industry chatter about Venezuela's interest in Aruba lately. But you've written the whole asset off at this point. So are you suggesting that there's no option going forward to sell or transfer the plant to another operator? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm looking at Jay to see what we say about this. Jay D. Browning - Executive Vice President & General Counsel : The option to transfer, it's still there. I mean, it's just a function of the financial requirements we've chosen to write off. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. So you can still transfer, but for free basically, is that kind of what you're signaling? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I guess so. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Chi. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, everyone. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Brad. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just a follow-up to Jeff's question a little while ago on yield. Lane, you mentioned the system's been running at maximum gasoline yield for quite a while now, and I think there was maybe an implication which you said that you're not running quite at maximum gasoline anymore. I'm curious just how you're thinking about your yield decisions these days. I would assume that given the incentives in the market at the moment, you're probably running a little more distillate, with more of a distillate focus than you had been, but how are you thinking about making catalyst decisions and so on that affect the next 18 months, 24 months? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: So, we are currently in, I would say, max-jet mode, so the decision you make there is between our cut point between jet and naphtha. And naphtha shows up in our sort of our overall results as a gasoline although it's not really. We export it. For maximizing jet \u2013 we're still actually maximizing gasoline is the next step, and it's largely due to butane blending economics. And it has to do with what we would call the swing cut (46:29) between the heavy part of cat gasoline and LTO and there's drilling (46:34) economics as well, to bring butane into the pull, so that's how we're postured today. But we're very close on all these things just because of where the relative cracks are. In terms of catalyst choices, FCCs, we can change relatively quickly. I would say, if we want \u2013 most of the time there we make a decision on whether we want to try to fill our alkylation capacity catalytically with like VSM5 (46:58) and not run as much rate. And that's normally what we do in the winter, and we're certainly looking at that, and I would be surprised if we didn't end up there. And on hydrocrackers, every three years we make that decision and that really is a choice between \u2013 it's not really gasoline and diesel in our hydrocrackers, it's really naphtha and diesel. And so we're still biased on the side of making distillate out of our big hydrocrackers. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, got it. Thanks for that color. And then I was curious if you could talk a little bit about the results in the North Atlantic this quarter. The indicator was up $3 sequentially, but the margin was down. What were the contributing factors to the performance? Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization : Yeah, Brad, this is Gary. I would tell you that the big factor that we saw there, if you're looking year-over-year, was our feedstock costs. So as you're aware, last year we had a pretty good incentive to move U.S. Gulf Coast barrels to Quebec, and we had a very good feedstock advantage doing that, but with the Brent TIR coming in, we lost a lot of that advantage, and it's impacted our North Atlantic Basin results. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Is that an yard (48:11) that you're still taking advantage of in the first quarter? I'm just thinking about it on a sequential basis versus the first quarter and the margin was down as well. Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so \u2013 yeah, so we move an occasional cargo to Quebec. But even when we're moving it, it's not near the margin that we saw last year when the yard (48:32) was much wider. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, I'll leave it at that. Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with UBS. Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones, hopefully. First, just on the OpEx. Figures are pretty strong this quarter, despite I guess slightly lower utilization. I guess just wondering how repeatable that is. I know next quarter it sounds like going to tick up a bit just given the turnarounds. But beyond that, just wondering if there is sort of belt-tightening going on and how much more we could see of that? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: So, this is Lane. We're always belt-tightening. I mean, we run our business very disciplined, we're always very attentive to all of our costs, and that's just the way we run our business. I would say our throughput is largely drive the \u2013 when you sort of compare quarter-to-quarter, year over year, it has to do with what our relative throughputs were through that timeframe that affects things, and obviously natural gas has a big hand in this. But those are really the two. When you start really looking at our \u2013 at least our cash operating expenses, it's really the energy and it has to do with our throughput. Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. That makes sense. And then just second one, seems like West Coast was a bit of a bright spot over the last quarter both on margins and cost. And I guess just focusing on margins, I guess how sustainable is that? I guess, over the last few weeks, they've come in a bit, but I know driving in the West Coast has been pretty strong and seems like demand there is pretty strong. And on top of that, I think some of the stockpile levels are a bit better than the rest of the U.S. I'm just wondering how you're viewing that market. John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Yeah, I think we feel pretty good about the West Coast. It's a unique grade of gasoline in that market, so it limits some of the stockpiling of barrels, and certainly with the increased demand, the production \u2013 the supply/demand balance is much tighter than it used to be. Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys. Operator : And thank you. We have a follow-up question from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. This is for Gary and Lane. When you decide whether you want to stretch the yield between distillate and gasoline, do you looking at the spot economic or that you also take into consideration of the future curve? Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Do you want to take that one? John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : I would say we do a combination of both, Paul. As you look, we certainly \u2013 we're making cut-points decision, it's more done on a spot economic basis. But when you talk about catalyst changes, then we're looking more \u2013 using the forward curve for those type of decisions. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, just for the cut of the temperature and that would be just on the spot. You won't be looking at, say, the next two months or three months what is the futures curve may suggest? John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : It comes into play, but for the most part, we're looking at spot economics on making cut point changes because we can do that day to day in our refining system. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And a final one, if I may. Maybe this is either for Lane and Gary also. If I'm looking at \u2013 if the third quarter market conditions would be extended the same as the second quarter, given your expectation of your runs, should we assume that your margin capture rate versus your Valero index would be roughly about the same or that is something that we should be consider? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Paul, this is Lane. I would say it's going to be roughly the same with the exception of where feedstocks are. I mean, that's really the only real major variable in terms of our capture rates. We'll start into butane blending at the end of the third quarter. That will affect it a little bit, as well. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: But that it won't start until September, right? The butane blending. The butane blending won't start until September, I presume? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Right. And then \u2013 but it'll \u2013 so there'll be a little bit of that impact. And the other one is, we do \u2013 as we've said earlier, we've disclosed that we have a big turnaround at the Gulf (52:44) in our Port Arthur refinery starting in the third quarter. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Is that a full planned turnaround? R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering: Over the course of the timeframe, most of the refineries, with the exception of \u2013 of our conversion units, will all be down. But it's really the crude and coking complex that will be coming down. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : And thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to John Locke for closing remarks. John Locke - Vice President\u2013 Investor Relations : Thank you, Vanessa. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Please contact Karen Ngo or me if you have any additional questions. Thank you. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Vanessa and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time participants are in a listen-only mode. And later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Vanessa. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations & Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under Federal securities laws. These are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, our team again operated safely and reliably, and did a good job of capturing margin in a low, but improving margin environment. We also executed our projects well, completing major turnarounds and progressing on growth investments, while optimizing our portfolio. These actions enabled us to produce positive cash flow and to return a healthy amount of cash to stockholders. In the market, we continue to see solid product demand domestically and internationally. The sustained low price of crude oil and petroleum products, along with strong export demand, helped create a pull on domestic product inventories. We're also encouraged by the modest return of domestic shale crude production, which is good for diesel demand and crude differentials. On the downside, we continue to see negative impacts on Valero's earnings from exorbitant RINs prices. For the year, we expect to incur costs in the range of $750 million to $850 million to purchase RINs. At these levels, the expense is significant to our company and has our full attention. You've likely seen that we filed a petition with the EPA to address this issue. Our efforts are focused on moving the point of obligation, which we believe will not only level the playing field among refiners and retailers, but it'll also improve the penetration of renewable fuels, reduce RIN fraud, lower RIN speculation, and reduce costs for the consumer. We have had many constructive conversations with regulators and these conversations continue today. As you'd expect, we continue to work this issue aggressively. As I mentioned a moment ago, our refining operations were very good. We ran reliably during the quarter and experienced very little unplanned downtime. We completed major turnarounds at our Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries, which our teams planned very well and executed safely and successfully, and we will be wrapping up the restart process over the next few days. Our ethanol business performed very well, recording its highest operating income contribution since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our plants are the most competitive in the industry and are run by dedicated people. So it's great to see them again contributing to Valero's earnings in a meaningful way. Regarding strategic investments, we're pleased to have both our new crude units up and running. The Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, and the Houston crude unit, which was completed in June, both ran well during the quarter. Turning to the development of our Houston alkylation unit, the project is in the engineering and procurement phase and on track for completion in the first half of 2019. The economics of this project look good, given the tight outlook for octane and it also positions us well for Tier 3 gasoline compliance. Looking ahead to 2017, we expect spending on capital investments to be similar to the budget for 2016, which was $2.6 billion. I also want to share an update on our portfolio. Effective October 1, we disposed of our Aruba business. We've been on the island and in the community for a long time and worked hard to produce a win-win for Valero and the Government of Aruba. In addition, the Government of Aruba secured a new operator who plans to invest capital in the site and operate it as a bitumen upgrader, which should have a positive economic impact on the community. We're happy for the people of Aruba and for the assets to have a renewed purpose on the island. With respect to Valero Energy Partners, the dropdown of the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal in September helped us achieve our dropdown target for the year. Yesterday, we announced the distribution increase of 5.5% for the third quarter, which puts us on track to deliver 25% distribution growth through 2017. Although we don't plan to provide dropdown guidance for 2017 at this time, we are comfortable setting the target for annual distribution growth for 2018 of at least 20%. You'll hear more from VLP on their call later this week, but VLP has excellent operations, is in great shape. And finally, despite significant turnarounds during the quarter and the low-margin environment, we generated solid cash flow from operations. So far this year, we returned 148% of net income to stockholders and we're well ahead of our 75% payout ratio target for the year. We're also extending our payout ratio target of at least 75% of net income to 2017. So with that, John, I'll hand the call back over to you. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you, Joe. For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $613 million or $1.33 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding an income tax benefit of $42 million, or $0.09 per share related to the Aruba disposition, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $571 million, or $1.24 per share. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on page three of the earnings release tables. Operating income for the refining segment in the third quarter of 2016 was $990 million, which was $1.3 billion lower than the third quarter of 2015. Primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins due to elevated product inventories, lower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil, and higher RIN prices. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2016, which was in line with the third quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 95% throughput capacity utilization, with major turnarounds that occurred at the Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries. Both refineries are currently in the process of restarting operations. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.63 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016 were $0.17 per barrel lower compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and adjustments related to the Aruba disposition. The ethanol segment generated $106 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2016, which was $71 million higher than in the third quarter of 2015, largely due to higher gross margin per gallon resulting from lower corn prices. For the third quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $192 million and net interest expense was $115 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $470 million and the effective tax rate was 18% in the third quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower-than-expected and lower than the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to income tax benefit on the Aruba disposition and the favorable settlement of an income tax audit. With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end, total debt was $9 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.9 billion. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 25%. We had approximately $5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. We generated $863 million of cash from operating activities in the third quarter, which was after the impact of $176 million of unfavorable working capital changes, primarily a decrease in accounts payable. With regards to investing activities, we made $453 million of capital investments. Moving to financing activities, we returned $778 million in cash to stockholders in the third quarter, which included $276 million in dividend payments and $502 million for the purchase of 9.2 million shares of Valero common stock. We completed a $1.25 billion public debt offering in September, and in October we repaid $950 million of senior notes due in 2017. On a pro forma basis, after the repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%. Our Board of Directors approved an incremental $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization in September. And at quarter end, we had approximately $2.7 billion of repurchase authorization remaining. For 2016, we expect capital investments to total about $2.4 billion, which is slightly below our previous guidance due to lower turnaround costs and the timing of some growth CapEx spend. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.58 million to 1.63 million barrels per day. U.S. Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day. U.S. West Coast at 270,000 to 290,000 barrels per day. In the North Atlantic, at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect cost attributed to meeting our biofuel blending obligations, primarily related to RINs in the United States, to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. G&A expenses for the fourth quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be about $200 million and net interest expense should be about $150 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $465 million and our effective tax rate should be around 31%. That concludes our opening remarks. And before we open the call to questions, we ask that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Maybe if I could just ask \u2013 start out asking on payout and cash return to shareholders. Again \u2013 and this has been the case, I guess, over the course of the year, where you significantly exceeded your official payout target again despite a fairly challenging year. I mean, how do you think about managing this going forward? I know you reset the bar at 75% for 2017. How do you view the balance between returning the cash to shareholders and preserving optionality for growth projects that are \u2013 and (14:25) M&A, if necessary? Unknown Speaker : Well, all of those options are part of our capital allocation. So we did set the target at, at least 75% for 2017. So going forward we feel like that's an appropriate way to go into the \u2013 appropriate rate to start the year with, and then we'll analyze that as we move through the year and adjust it as accordingly. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Then maybe one question on the product environment as we head into the winter. I mean, last year the industry massively overproduced gasoline through the winter, setting up a challenging position into 2016. Can you share your thoughts, as we head into this winter, on managing inventories of gasoline versus just for (15:16) balance as you shift to winter-grade gasoline and what role \u2013 I know on the last quarter we talked some about potential for economic run cuts into the latter part of the year. Do you still see that as necessary in managing inventories, or we done enough work at this point where you think you're okay? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Ryan, this is Gary. I think that we will need to see some economic run cuts in the industry. If you look at what's happened in the market, Chicago has been selling off fairly sharply over the last week and we're starting to see inventories build in the Mid-Continent. So, typically, especially in that land locked region, the market is short product in the summer and becomes long product in the winter. And I think refineries in that region will need to cut to balance the market as we move into the fourth and first quarters. Elsewhere, I think a lot of what you saw last year in terms of refiners running high on utilization and producing summer-grade gasoline was really a function of the steep carry in the market. And certainly at least the Brent curve is flatter this year than what we saw last year. And I think as there's not as much carry in the market, it will go ahead and cause refiners to cut down on utilization and avoid some of the products build that we saw last year. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Ryan. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just a couple of questions I'd like to kind of hit on here. First as part of the capital allocation and something that's gotten hammered in some prior conference calls, so let's get out the tools again for this one. M&A and plenty of units appear to be on the market, not all, of course, would be interesting to you. But I was wondering how you're looking at the M&A market, and is that still something that seems attractive to Valero? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Yeah, Roger, this is Mike. It is attractive. We're \u2013 on the capital allocation side it's definitely part of our strategy. We're interested in acquiring logistics assets that provide third party revenue or are strategic to our core business. And on the refining side, we're interested in assets that are high quality, globally competitive and advantaged location. So for us that primarily means the U.S. Gulf Coast. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And any thoughts beyond the Gulf Coast of anything that \u2013 I mean, is there any real interest in moving beyond kind of your existing footprint further into Europe, anything like that? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Roger, this is Joe. I mean, if assets came into the market, we'd look. But I would tell you, no, there's nothing on the radar screen right now outside of what Mike described to you. I think if you look at our system, you see where we could produce the greater synergies and that would be the U.S. Gulf Coast, and so that is our focus. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Appreciate that, and then unrelated follow-up. You mentioned the improvement in U.S. drilling being good for diesel demand and for the differentials. Obviously, diesel demand happens quicker. Do you have kind of a rule of thumb that you use for rigs and diesel demand on either a \u2013 I don't know \u2013 I guess, a daily basis or anything like that? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Roger, this is Gary. I really can't \u2013 I don't have any insight into that at all. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Very interesting question, though. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: We all looked at each other, Roger, when you asked it. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. So I've stumped the masters for a change. Appreciate it, guys. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You got it. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Phil. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question is just on the capital spending for this year. Obviously, you've been running at an exceptionally low rate, even relative to your guidance for the full year. So wondering what the key drivers of the lower capital spending have been, and if there's something specific in the fourth quarter that would suggest such a high rate implicit in the full year guidance. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. The capital for 2016 here is, we've adjusted it for $2.4 billion. It's primarily due to lower turnaround costs than what we had anticipated. And then we have some timing on our growth capital expenditure spend that's being lower. It's really a timing issue, as John discussed in his notes. So some of that's being pushed to the future here. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just maybe a second question on the balance sheet. With your leverage ratio at 22%, which is still pretty conservative relative to the 20% to 30% target range, if fundamentals remain challenging again next year like they were this year, should we think that you'd be willing to be similarly aggressive next year? Is there any reason that this year would be unique? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Aggressive in what - Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : In terms of buying back well above your target. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Oh. Yeah. I mean, what we do consider, in a lower earnings environment, the net income obviously is a little bit lower, but we do have quite a bit of depreciation in there. So we look at other factors as well as cash flow. So we'll look at our cash flow generating capabilities and all our sources of cash in paying out and buying back the stock. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I guess my \u2013 the question would be, are you willing to add a little bit more leverage, if necessary, to continue down the path of buybacks? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: No, we would not. We would not lever up to buy back stock. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Neil. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Joe, can we get your comments on this RINs topic. Thanks for your comments earlier. But what do you think the political appetite is to actually change the RVO this year, and then from your dialogue and discussion with Washington to ultimately change the point of obligation? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, okay. So, it's very hard for me to comment on the political situation, so let me focus on the second part first. Okay? And I mentioned that the conversations that we've had have been very constructive. We've had conversations not only with the regulators, but also with the White House. And there is a clear acknowledgment that the structure of the current program isn't delivering the desired results. And so, these are smart people that we're talking to, and they're really trying to understand it and figure out. So, as an industry, let me just say this, the independent refiners, AFPM and certainly Valero, we're working with them to help them understand the issue, certainly as we see it. And there's a clear acknowledgment that we've got a situation that needs to be resolved. Now, as far as the political climate, you know what, we're couple of weeks away from the election. And although we would love to see something change this year, I don't know that we'll get that. But it's certainly receiving enough attention and it is being discussed, to the point where we believe that it's getting worked and that we should have some type of resolution and relief in the not too near future. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate that, Joe. And the second is more specific to the quarter. It was a strong quarter, particularly in the Gulf Coast. Can you talk about what you think drove the strength of the captures despite the downtime at Port Arthur? And any of these factors that you would define as more one-time versus repeatable? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Neil, this is Gary. I think, first, we ran very well and that certainly contributed. When I look at the market factors, I would say the biggest thing I see is, we buy a lot of other feedstocks other than crude, a lot of VGO and resids. And if you look at the pricing of the VGOs and resids that we purchased in the U.S. Gulf Coast system relative to Brent, they were much cheaper than what we saw either last quarter or a year ago at this time. And I would say that was the biggest driver to the capture rates. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's great, guys. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Joe, I hear you talking about the U.S. Gulf Coast as the desired M&A target region for you. But of course that Shell is also putting up their San Francisco refining system for sale and realistically not too many people will be interested in buying. So from an M&A standpoint, does it make it intriguing for you to look at that, given that you already have two refineries? Now if you add another one, you may get something that you benefit probably not as much as what you can get from the Gulf Coast, but at the same time the competition for the bid is probably much lower. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. Paul, that's a very good question and let me just share this that when we have looked at our ability to acquire additional assets in California historically, we have been precluded. And it's more of a FTC issue for us than anything else. I think it would be very, very difficult for us to execute another refinery acquisition in California. Perhaps the West Coast would be something that would be viable, but I don't think we could get another deal done in California. So, it really hasn't been something that we've spent a lot of time talking about. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So even after Tesoro get approval to buy Carson, you think that the whole FTC restriction is still being applied? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes, I think for us it certainly would be. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I see. Okay. Second question that you do have a nice UK operation. Just curious that on the ground what have you seen in terms of the European demand? Are they \u2013 I mean, we have seen unseasonal uptick in the European refining margins. So is it driven primarily because people on the refinery downtime or that the underlying strength and the demand is better than people think? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Paul, this is Gary. I don't know if it was really tied to downtime or not, but we did see very good wholesale demand through our UK system. And our wholesale profitability certainly contributed to our results in the North Atlantic Basin. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, Gary, you think it's more demand-driven than supply? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: I really don't know that I see the data well enough to be able to comment on that, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I see. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Evan. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, Joe. So, some encouraging comments this morning on the RFS and the RFS topic. Can you give us update on your lawsuits? Procedurally, where they stand? What are the key dates moving forward, just so we can at least follow how things have progressed on that more hostile front? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. Hey, listen, Evan, why don't I let Jay Browning, who's neck deep in this thing just give you some color? Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Perfect. Jay D. Browning - Valero Energy Corp.: The timeline is really going to be driven more by the process that Joe was describing. EPA's expected to finalize a rule, I believe, by the end of November. And the litigation will play out and there's lots and lots of players who are involved with that. So there is \u2013 at this point there's really nothing to put out there in front of you in terms of detail on timing that would be crucial to the process. I think other factors \u2013 the political process is more the driver at this point. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, I mean, litigation is kind of being used in that, I guess, negotiation or information awareness process at this stage? Jay D. Browning - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I mean, the litigation is out there, but it is more or less used as a framework and as a last resort. Obviously, our preference would be for EPA to volitionally move the point of obligation of its own accord rather than being forced through the litigation process. But we've got the litigation out there just to \u2013 as a placeholder and a stake in the ground, if you will, just to let everybody know this issue is not going to go away. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And November's approaching. My second question is more of a macro question. We look at global turnarounds for the industry, at least planned, as being much lower in 2016 relative to 2015 and that having been a major contributor to weaker sequential cracks (29:10) this year. You can see it and you've mentioned it in the higher utilization data. I know Valero \u2013 I know you guys plan turnarounds several years in advance, but can you give us any color on your expectations for planned maintenance into 2017, at least sequentially higher or lower, and any views on that potential normalization of turnarounds providing a better environment in 2017? John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Evan, this is John. I think you summed it up. We really don't have kind of a forward view on turnarounds that we can share. I know there's resources out there where people can go and get views from contractors and what not, but I think our in-house view is we just don't have forward guidance on turnarounds. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. All right, guys. Thank you. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Evan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert with Simmons. Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Jeff. Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Appreciate the guidance \u2013 or target on the 75% payout for 2017. I was hoping you could talk about some of the major factors that you expect to influence profitability in 2017. Some of the factors we're watching, Tier 3 implementation, CAFE standards, potential OPEC cuts. What do you see as the major drivers for 2017 margin environment? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: So, Jeff, let me go ahead and \u2013 that's one of those questions that, I mean, we just are going to kind of share musings on I guess. So, why don't I just see if Gary and Lane have any comments for you on it? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: I guess I'll start with the OPEC cuts, Jeff, that you brought up. So far, we'll know a lot more about what's going to happen there when they have their November meeting. But if you look at the proposed volumes of the cuts, it looks like the volumes are about the same as what Saudi Arabia typically burns in the summer for power generation. So I don't know that we'll see any real impact on exports even if they had the cuts. But overall, the world is still oversupplied with oil and we expect we'll see greater exports from Nigeria, Libya, Kazakhstan, Iraq, and Brazil. So we still feel like on the crude feedstock side, you're going have this competition between medium sour crudes and light sweet, where they're competing for available refining capacity, which will cause the medium sour discounts to be wide. And then with additional exports from Canada and South America on the heavy side, the heavies are going to have to compete with medium sours, and so we expect good discounts there. That's kind of a view of the crude markets. On the product side, I think we think that the gasoline market, as long as you're in this low price environment, you'll continue to see good demand response on gasoline. And then on distillate, we expect a little bit more normal winter weather in both the United States and Northwest Europe will help the distillate market along with some recovery and economic growth, and we'll see a little bit stronger distillate cracks going into next year. Lane, I don't know what else you - R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: The only thing I'd comment on is Tier 3. January 1 of this coming year is when Tier 3 really comes into effect. There are people like us who generated credits with our existing units under Tier 2, which put us in position not really needing to get all of our capacity up and running until 2020. But different people \u2013 or different companies and refineries are in different position with respect to that. So between 2017 \u2013 beginning of 2017 and somewhere in the 2020 timeframe you'll see these units start up. That will destroy octane, so you should see alkylate and the premium regrade strengthen throughout that period. Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Thanks. Secondly, if I could ask about your RINs guidance for the full year. We've lost our ability to track RINs prices on a regular basis, and I was hoping you could comment on where RINs prices are now. It would appear that there's either a price or a volume increase in the fourth quarter that would be required, given the first three quarters of expenses you've had to get into this $750 million to $850 million range. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, yeah \u2013 no, Jeff, I think, look, what's going happen in the RINs prices going forward, we've heard a lot of RINs commentary about things that could affect the prices, so I think we have a forecast. We have a view. We set that out. It's a pretty wide range accordingly, right, $750 million to $850 million. You can see where our actuals have been through the year. But we just have to kind of stay tuned and see. We're not prepared to change it at this time. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I mean, year-to-date we're at about $525 million is the expense. Second quarter was roughly \u2013 or third quarter was roughly $200 million. Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International : All right. Thanks for your comments. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: And, Jeff, just one thing. We're not trying to be resistant to giving you guidance on this. But if you look historically at where they've been, from 2011 to 2015, I think RIN price averaged like $0.33. Last year they were like $0.55 \u2013 $0.50 to $0.55. This year, obviously, they've been higher than that. And I think a lot of it comes down to where is the EPA going to set the RVO. And if they set a high RVO, where they're pushing us through the blend wall, I think we can all expect that we're going to have high RINs prices. And if they set it at a reasonable level that's achievable by industry, then I think we'll see it come off again. There's so many reasons that it's high right now, but it is clearly those with length are taking advantage of those that are short, and we're seeing that in the speculation in the market. So again, it's an unregulated market with not a lot of transparency. It is really very, very difficult to forecast. Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International : Yeah, certainly opportunity for substantial volatility. I appreciate that. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, so sorry, bud. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, everyone. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Brad. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Gary, following-on on the OPEC question from earlier. I was curious specifically about Venezuela. I think it would be consensus that those are among the most at-risk volumes in the world right now. So I'm curious how much Valero takes from Venezuela, and also if you take any sort of net credit risk in your commercial activities with Venezuela? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, so I'll comment on \u2013 really our volumes are not consistent month-to-month. They vary up and down, and I'll let Mike comment on the credit. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Most of the business that we have is with Citgo, but we really don't discuss our credit analysis and stuff with our various customers. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, got it. And then, Mike, I guess following-on on an earlier question about CapEx, maybe trying to attack it a different way. I think that year-to-date you guys have spent like $1.4 billion in CapEx. You've been doing like $450 million or $500 million a quarter. So that would imply like $1 billion of spending in the fourth quarter. Is there any reason why that would be the case? Why the spending would go up so much? I know in the past sometimes you've included like an acquisition or something in those numbers. Is that what's responsible for it? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: No, we don't include acquisitions in these numbers. I mean, it's the estimate that we have at this time. We've got the turnaround spend being finished here. And so that's the number that we've decided to give at this point. There's probably a little downside \u2013 or it will come in a little below that. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with UBS. Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on the payout ratio there and maybe narrow it a little bit and focus more on the dividend. I think the goal earlier this year was to get that dividend higher, closer to peers or at least at the top end of the range. And I guess you're there right now. So, just curious your appetite to increase it from here as you head into next year and how that figures into your 75% ratio. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, we've already increased the dividend once this year. But if you look at how our history demonstrates, we would like to be in the position of increasing our dividend annually. And as you mentioned, our intention is to pay at the top end of the range, and so we'll monitor that and stay at the top end of the range as we move forward. Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. That makes sense. And then second question just wanted to follow-up on your comments around, I guess, export demand for refined products and maybe a few different angles here. I guess we're surprised that it's actually held up this strong, because we continue to hear about the bloated stockpiles globally, anecdotally here about Chinese gasoline cargoes hitting the East Coast of the U.S., and so clearly lot of product out there. And I guess I'm just wondering how sustainable that demand is, if you can give us some granularity on where that pull is coming from, and how much is maybe refinery outages in South America that maybe you can't count on to always be there. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, this is Gary. I think we continue to see very good demand for gasoline into Mexico and South America. I think in the short term some of that is certainly driven by refinery outages, but we see good growth in that region and expect that we'll see continued exports into those regions moving forward. Certainly, the opening up of Mexico will also help us with our export business as well. Distillates we see good demand in both South America and the yard to Europe is currently open. So we see very good demand on the distillate side as well. Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Appreciate the color. That's it for me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice results on the quarter. Gary, just following-up on that last comment on the exports, it looks like there was a pretty healthy decline quarter-to-quarter, and I didn't know if that's just kind of seasonal in nature, if the arb window simply closed or anything like that. I didn't know if maybe it was potentially reflective of weakness in demand. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: No, Blake, I'll break it apart. On the gasoline side we did 93,000 barrels a day, which is down some, but gasoline typically follows seasonal patterns. While you're in driving season here in the U.S., we typically don't export as much and it's more a statement of the strength of the U.S. market rather than lack of demand into the export markets. ULSD we did 236,000 barrels a day. If you add the jet and kerosene, we were at 283,000 barrels a day. There it was more a function of the turnaround activity we had in the Gulf. The Meraux hydro cracker was down and then we had the Port Arthur turnaround. And so it just limited the availability of export quality distillate into our system, and that's why the numbers are down on the distillate. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Got it. Okay. And then the second question. I realize you're not going to want to get into too much detail on guidance on this, but typically when we see a crude spike like we've see in this quarter, there tends to be a negative impact on the secondary product pricing and resid. And I'm just curious if you're kind of witnessing some of that in the marketplace. I guess, what I'm fishing around on is, should capture rates maybe suffer a bit quarter-to-quarter as a result of the rapid increase that we've seen? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Blake, you're correct. Normally you would see that. The one thing that's different for us is we've seen that propylene prices spike fairly considerably. So the strength in propylene in our system thus far has really offset the negative impact of the secondary products that we would normally see when flat price goes up. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Good deal. Okay. Thanks a bunch. Appreciate it, guys. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: I appreciate you taking my questions. Hey, Joe. So, Joe, on the buyback, I guess dividend distribution, the 75% target. Given that you've obviously been running pretty well ahead of that, is there any consideration to either reconsider the absolute level or the balance between dividends and buybacks? And I've got a quick follow-up please. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, obviously \u2013 and I'll let Mike speak to this. But, Doug, obviously, we're always looking at that. And Mike mentioned earlier, okay, you use 75% of net income because it provides absolute transparency into what the number is, and that's one of the things that we use for planning purposes. Mike's also looking at his percentage of cash flow dependent on how things are there. And then again, we continue to look at the balance between the dividend and the buybacks. In our view, though, the dividend is nondiscretionary. The buyback is discretionary. And so we need to be very confident that we're going to continue to have cash flows and that we're going to be able to continue to manage the capital budget the way that the company's done over the last couple of years to be sure that if we increase the dividend, we're good to go. So, Mike, with that what would you... Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: I don't really have anything to add to that. I mean, the dividend is the commitment to the shareholder and that is our priority. Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: I guess, is there \u2013 maybe I don't want to belabor this particular point, but in terms of dividend growth, if you were thinking kind of mid-cycle earnings level for the company, is there an aspiration to have a dividend growth target on top of that, or are we just going to stick with the 75%? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, for now we're going to stick with the 75%, Doug. And I think we've answered it. We're not going get pinned down right now on announcing a dividend increase, that's for sure. But I think we're going go ahead and stick with the 75% for the time being and we'll continue to look at it. Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate that. My follow-up hopefully a quick one is, as the earnings mix changes a little bit, as you see more coming from the MLP obviously over time, what's the guidance on the tax rate going forward? Because, obviously, it's consistently been at a pretty better level, I guess, compared to what we would have expected. So, this run rate for the tax rate and I'll leave it there. Thanks. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, this quarter we had a couple of items that benefited our tax rate. Our guidance was 30%. We had the Aruba disposition and that provided, I guess, it was about 6% improvement on the tax position. We had the favorable settlement on an income tax audit. That provided about 4%. So those would have given us a 28% when you back those out. Our guidance was 30%. So we had a few minor things. Going forward, 30%, 31% looks like a good number. Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, fellows. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Maybe just to follow-on from Doug's question on the dividend in a different way. I mean, you are investing just under $1 billion of growth capital, which should provide some sort of uplift to EBITDA over time. I mean is one way to think about it is, you've got this net income payout and you're willing to sort of keep that flat, and then as this growth capital comes in, you could perhaps use that to drive the dividend higher? And then specifically, on that growth capital, I mean, talk a little bit about the funnel to maintain that $1 billion level and maybe the split between refining and logistics just at the very high level. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: On our capital, I think next year we're looking at similar to our budget for 2016, about $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion. $1.5 billion of that will be for sustaining and maintenance capital, about $1 billion or so for growth capital, and that will be split about 50%-50% between refining and logistics. So right now we're comfortable at the 75% target on the payout, so that's where we're at on that. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Ed, that was \u2013 your question was kind of a mouthful. But it was \u2013 it's hard to say that, okay, all the incremental income produced from growth projects is going go into the dividend. If we knew what margins were going to be in two months, if we were selling something where we could set the price and set the margin and just the only issue is how much are you going to manufacture, it'd be wonderful. But that's not the way this business functions. And because we've made the commitment to the dividend, we're very careful with it. We've also told you guys, we're not going to sit here and accumulate cash. And that's why we've gone ahead and exceeded the payout ratio target of 75%, because we've had stronger cash flows than we had anticipated. And so we've gone ahead and used the funds accordingly. We have a lot of discipline around the capital budgeting process, and you're not going to see that whipsaw significantly. So, it's not like Lane and Gary and Rich are running out trying to find another $1.5 billion of capital projects so that we can spend the money. So anyway, I think you should expect consistent performance from us on this. And, again, we will continue to look at the dividend and I would expect, as Mike said, that we would continue to try to increase the dividend. But we're not prepared to commit to it right now. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, and then the second one is, unfortunately, another follow-up on RINs. So do you think that the November ruling would actually deal with the point of obligation? And if they do deal with the point of obligation and say move it to the blending racks, what would be the impact on your RVO in total? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well... Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Because presumably you have a big impact, but just trying to get a clarity on that. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I'm just trying to think through how to answer that. And I think I would rather not, because we haven't given any guidance on what our absolute RVO is. So giving you a number for it after the fact, but it would go down materially. So... Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And then on the EPA \u2013 sorry... Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Go ahead, buddy. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Sorry. On the whether this ruling at the end of November is actually going to deal with the point of obligation. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what their plan is. I would love to think that they were going to do it, but I think all we've got commitments from them on so far is that they're going to announce the obligations. It would be very nice if they would open up our petition to a rule making on it so that we could have some conversation around it. And as Jay mentioned, if they would do that, then I think we would see some effect on the RIN price. But I'm not been very good at trying to predict exactly what they're going to do. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, everyone. Just if I could immediately follow-up while we're on the dreaded subject. Joe, did you petition as Valero because \u2013 why didn't the refining industry lobby petition as opposed to you guys doing it individually? Is that an evidence that's there's a split amongst refiners? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, okay. So first of all, we did it because it's a material issue to us and we're a large refiner, and we're going to do what's best for us. Secondly, the AFPM did also file and their petition is similar to ours to move the point of obligation. So it \u2013 your third question is, is everybody in the industry of a like mind on this? The answer would be no, and I think it depends on where you happen to sit. If you're long RINs with a more integrated system through retail, I think you're going be a lot more comfortable with the status quo. And if you're an independent refiner or a retail marketer that doesn't have the ability to move up the rack, then you're going to want to see this point of obligation moved. Paul, from my perspective, it's a very simple point of view. It is, you create a situation where the obligation and the point of compliance are two different points, and they shouldn't be. And so it's \u2013 by moving the point of obligation, obviously, we align the natural point of compliance with the natural point of obligation. And a lot of this speculation in the RINs market goes away. People will not be incentivized to build inventories of RINs to hold out for higher prices, to squeeze the shorts as we've seen. So anyway, I think I answered you, which - Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : You did. I think earlier in the call, Joe, you sort of said you thought it would be resolved. I guess, then subsequently you seem to be saying that you're not very good at predicting it and you're not sure what will come out in November. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: I think that it's going be resolved, but I do not know that it's going to happen before this election cycle happens. And then you tell me what the Obama administration's going to want to deal with between November and January. I can't predict that. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Something tells me it's not going to be RINs, Joe. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: (52:09). Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : If I could just ask about the CapEx. Actually you did define how much was growth, how much was maintenance. Are we assuming around $800 million of turnaround? I don't know if you said you didn't want to comment on that. I think that the guidance was originally maybe for $1 billion this year of turnaround and is being dropped. I'm sorry if I got the numbers wrong. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Typically, our turnaround expense is $700 million to $800 million on an annual basis. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, so that's what you'll be assuming for next year then? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I think that's fair. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : That's great. And I just guess the final one would be, the net income target that you've talked about, the fact that you're sailing over that, why don't you look at it just purely from a cash point of view? Because you said that, because of the strength of cash, you're paying out more. Wouldn't it be smarter or easier for us all to just use a cash-on-cash dividend target? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, we feel like that the net income is very transparent. There's a lot of things that flow through the cash flow item like working capital items and such that you could have wild swings on your cash flow generation, and so our preference is net income. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Can I have a final one? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Paul, that's four now. You'll get me in trouble here. Unknown Speaker : Give him one more. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : While I've got Lane. Could you just talk about the recent draw on inventories that we've seen, Lane, and imports of crude? What's your perspective on that somewhat surprising series of draws that we've seen? And I'll leave it there, I promise. Thanks. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey, Paul. I'll have to defer to my friend here, Mr. Gary Simmons, on that. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. Paul, so I think you see these Brent TIR swinging back and forth, and so what we get into is that TI gets priced to where some barrels leave the Gulf and then the arb comes back in and incentivizes imports. So what we've seen is, we saw some barrels leaving the Gulf. It's kind of imbalanced today to where St. James is marginally getting to the point where you would want to import barrels again. So I think that's what you've seen in the crude markets. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Cool. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Chi. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi, Joe. I appreciate your legal and policy change focus on the RINs. But are you specifically implementing any strategies right now to reduce your RIN purchase obligation through increasing terminal exposure, changing commercial arrangements, or any other measure? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes. Yes to all of the above, and trying to continue to build the wholesale business. So we're looking at all those things. Those are the levers that we've got to pull, and then exports is the other one. And I think Gary and his team continue to look at the economics of exports with the RIN in mind, and so we're trying to manage our costs down every way we possibly can. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Does M&A focus on the midstream side? Is this a big priority, I guess, when you look at midstream growth position? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. No, it's a priority. Obviously, we've seen a lot of things transact here and we've looked at a lot of things. But it is a priority for us, Chi. I think we'd like to \u2013 again, as we said earlier in the call, we'd like to find assets in a perfect world that had third party volume and supported Valero's core business, but either/or is good with us. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks. And then second question, your refining OpEx performance is pretty stellar. I imagine low gas \u2013 nat gas prices are a part of it, but I suspect there's probably more to that. Can you talk about the company's efforts on the cost front? Gulf Coast, you're trending at $3.50 a barrel, which is pretty amazing for your complexity there. And also North Atlantic, looks like you're way down on OpEx relative to the past few years. So any comments on that end would be helpful. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Chi, I'm just going to be \u2013 I'm going to answer this in general. It's a core value for us to manage our expenses aggressively all the time, but we do that in light of being very reliable. One of the tenets of our operation is we believe we get to a lower cost business by making sure that we implement our liability programs, so we minimize big one-time events that can turn into very expensive expense events. And that's essentially the way we think about running our business. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Is there something specific in the North Atlantic? Because it really looks like it's been measurable on the production. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: No. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Lane. Appreciate it. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Chi. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Sam. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: I wanted to go back to 2017 CapEx, if that's all right. The gated process to the capital program sort of sets up a possible scenario, where your growth CapEx number could be a lot lower than it has been this year or previous years or what you just mentioned for 2017. I guess, given the fact that the refining cycle has been challenging this year and it would have been hard for kind of people outside the fence to really easily identify a really good project in this kind of market. What is that \u2013 what would it take for the growth CapEx number to come down to a level that we haven't seen for a while? And then I guess that would introduce another list of possibilities on the return of cash side, and maybe if you could talk about how those two things are linked, too. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Do you want to talk about capital? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Sam, this is Lane. It's an interesting question. I wouldn't say that we have a complete shortcoming of potential projects. We have a strategic outlook, which we believe is we have \u2013 we believe that octane is going be in short supply going forward and we believe feedstock flexibility is something that we're always continuing to look at. I'm not going to say that there's not the possibility that somehow our growth CapEx will fall. But we have plenty of sort of small, fast hitting projects that compete in that space. You also got to remember, we have a strategic \u2013 we're strategically trying to get the right network (58:51) on our secondary costs through building those assets and dropping them into the MLP. And that's \u2013 as Mike alluded to earlier, that's about 50% of our growth CapEx for next year. So... Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, we \u2013 I mean, Sam, the fact that we're not out there talking about a bunch of capital projects just goes back to the fundamental principle that we're operating by, which was we don't talk about them until we're confident we're going to do the project. Again, we don't want to get out over our skis and over-commit, and then end up needing to back it down. So I don't think you should read anything into a lower capital number based on lack of opportunities that we're looking at. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, I guess, just following-up on a comment you made in the introduction about some positive signals you're seeing in U.S. unconventional upstream. The new crude units position you pretty well for that inflexion. I remember in the first quarter you gave a result for the first one. I think it was $30 million of EBITDA, which sort of put you right on the fairway of guidance. But production wasn't growing \u2013 at the time production was declining in the U.S. So at this point can you catch us up a little bit on the performance and sort of establish whether we have seen sort of, I guess, proof of concept in those projects by this point? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. So, Sam, this is Lane again. Our for funding, or FID (01:00:16) EBITDA for those projects, for Corpus it's $150 million and for Houston it was about $130 million. And so in the third quarter, they both per unit contributed about $45 million a piece. So you can sort of look at the run rate and they're clearly in line with what our funding decisions were with respect to \u2013 on the EBITDA basis. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Fernando Valle with Citi. Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'll keep it brief. Just quickly on the change in regulations, IRS regulations for partnership liability and disguise sale, does that impact your plans for dropdowns into VLP for next year at all? Did you have any impact on previous drops into VLP? Thank you. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: It does not have any impact on the previous drops into the MLP. It's not retroactive and it really has no material impact on our plans, on the EBITDA, the amount of EBITDA that we have to drop. Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. But do you expect a major impact as far as the potential tax liability for VLO on dropdowns? Or it doesn't really impact on - Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: No, it's not material to the tax liability that we're already incurring. Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. It seems we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to John Locke for closing remarks. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Vanessa. Thanks everyone for calling today. If you have any additional questions, please contact me or Karen Ngo after the call. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Vanessa and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Locke : Well, good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks, John and good morning everyone. The fourth quarter and the full year 2016 were good for Valero as we achieved our best performance ever in the areas of personnel and process safety, plant reliability, and environmental stewardship. We are very proud of our team\u2019s exceptional execution, which we believe is imperative in our business and critical during the low margin environment like we saw for most of the year. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see good domestic demand supported by low prices and solid export volumes due primarily to demand strength in Latin America. While we saw seasonal declines in available margin in some regions, margins in the Gulf Coast region remained healthy and distillate margins in all regions were bolstered by a return to more normal weather patterns in North America and Europe. We also saw attractive heavy sour discounts relative to Brent. A persistent headwind again this quarter was the exorbitant price of RINs. We spent $217 million in the fourth quarter to meet our biofuel blending obligations. At this level, this is a significant issue for us so we continue to work it aggressively with regulators. Our efforts are focused on moving the point of obligation because we believe this will level the playing field among refiners and retailers, but more importantly, it will improve the penetration of renewable fuels, lower RIN speculation, and reduce RIN fraud. However, based on current rules, we expect costs in 2017 to be similar to the $750 million amount we incurred last year. Given significance of this cost to our company, this issue continues to have our full attention. Turning to our refining segment, we initiated turnarounds at our Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries in the third quarter. Both events carried over into and were completed in the fourth quarter. Our employees and contractors worked hard to safely complete these events. We believe distinctive operating performance is highly correlated to capturing more of the margin available in the market. In our ethanol business, we also ran very well and saw strong margins in the fourth quarter due to high gasoline demand in the U.S., strong pull from export markets, and low corn prices. Also in the fourth quarter, we invested over $600 million to sustain and grow our business. Construction continued on our $450 million Diamond Pipeline project, which we believe is on track for completion at the end of this year, and we continue to work on our $300 million Houston alkylation unit, which we expect to be mechanically complete in the first half of 2019. We also have additional growth investment opportunities under development around octane enhancement, cogeneration, and feedstock flexibility. And finally, regarding cash return to stockholders, we delivered a payout ratio of 142% of our 2016 adjusted net income, which was 78% higher than our payout ratio for 2015 and well above our target for 2016. Further demonstrating our belief in Valero\u2019s earnings power, last week our Board of Directors approved a 17% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share or $2.80 annually. So John, with that, I will hand the call back over to you. John Locke : Thank you, Joe. For the fourth quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $367 million or $0.81 per share compared to $298 million or $0.62 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $862 million or $1.79 per share. For 2016, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.3 billion or $4.94 per share compared to $4 billion or $7.99 per share in 2015. 2016 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.7 billion or $3.72 per share compared to $4.6 billion or $9.24 per share for 2015. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts as shown on Page 3 of the financial tables that our company released. Operating income for the refining segment in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $715 million compared to $876 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $1.5 billion. The decline from the 2015 adjusted amount was primarily due to narrower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent, weaker gasoline margins in some regions, and higher RINs prices. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 95% throughput capacity utilization in the fourth quarter of 2016 with major turnarounds at the Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries completed early in the quarter. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.83 per barrel were $0.36 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 primarily due to favorable property tax settlements and adjustments in 2015 and higher energy cost in 2016. The ethanol segment generated $126 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $37 million. The increase from the 2015 adjusted amount was due primarily to lower corn prices and higher ethanol prices. For the fourth quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $208 million and net interest expense was $112 million. Net interest expense was lower than guidance due to prepayment penalties associated with the early redemption of the 2017 notes being reflected in other income. Depreciation and amortization expense was $468 million and the effective tax rate was 21% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower than expected due primarily to stronger than projected relative earnings contribution from our international operations that have lower statutory rates and other items as referenced in the release. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $8 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.8 billion, of which $71 million was held by VLP. Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 23%. We have $5.6 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $720 million was available for only VLP. We generated $998 million of cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter. With regard to investing activities, we made $628 million of capital investments, of which $244 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. For 2016, we invested $2 billion, which was slightly lower than guidance due to lower turnaround costs and the timing of some growth spending. And of this total, $1.4 billion was for sustaining and $600 million was for growth. Moving to financing activities, we returned $440 million in cash to our stockholders in the fourth quarter, which included $271 million in dividend payments and $169 million for the purchase of 2.7 million shares of Valero common stock. For 2016, we purchased 23.3 million shares for $1.3 billion and had approximately $2.5 billion of authorization remaining. For 2017, we maintain our guidance of $2.7 billion for capital investments, including turnarounds, catalysts, and joint venture investments. This consists of approximately $1.6 billion for sustaining and $1.1 billion for growth. For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges; U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.63 million to 1.68 million barrels per day, U.S. Mid-Continent at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 195,000 to 215,000 barrels per day, which reflects a major turnaround at the Venetia refinery and North Atlantic at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.15 per barrel, which reflects projected increased natural gas prices. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation for the first quarter to be around $175 million and net interest expense should be about $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $485 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 30%. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions each. This will help us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : Good morning everyone. Joe Gorder : Good morning Brad. Brad Heffern : Hey Joe. So I was wondering, obviously a big topic of conversation has been the border adjustment tax in the space, so can you go through your thoughts on how that\u2019s going to affect feedstock costs, your ability to pass it on and maybe the likelihood that you see if that\u2019s actually making it through? Joe Gorder : Yes, you bet. We will give you a point of view. What I would like to do is let Jason Fraser answer that question. Jason has recently taken the position as the individual responsible for our public policy and strategic planning group, so we brought him back from London to take on this job. And it\u2019s interesting we put the two functions together, strategic planning and public policy, because in our view you really can\u2019t bifurcate the two anymore. They are going to be very intertwined. So Jason, you want to go ahead and share your point of view? Jason Fraser : Sure. Yes. I will give you a heads-up on where we are with the house tax blueprint. And we have read all of your reports. As you know, there are greatly differing opinions on the blueprints, including the border tax, border adjustment tax aspect, how it affects our industry, and Valero. We are performing our own analysis as well as working through scenarios with AFPM, our trade association. We are also engaged with the legislative process. We are at the very early stages. No legislative tax has been released by the ways and means committee yet, so we are not sure exactly what\u2019s going to be in it. But we are going to continue to work this issue. Regarding the likelihood of passage, you guys know that any kind of major legislative change like this is difficult to pass. If there isn\u2019t bipartisan support, the Republicans may have to use the budget reconciliation process. We also have a new administration which adds another variable. So it\u2019s really hard to handicap at this stage how it\u2019s likely to turn out. Brad Heffern : Okay. Thanks for that. And then Joe or maybe Gary or Lane, the South Coast AQMD in California has talked about potentially banning the use of hydrofluoric acid, I was curious if you know what the impact will potentially be on Wilmington and maybe the chance of that going through as well? Lane Riggs : So Brad, this is Lane. So yes, we are engaged in the process and there is obviously a conversation around it. And I can\u2019t really share much more than that than it does impact our operations, so we did have an HF unit [ph] there as long as the operator there in Torrance, and there are technologies out there. Obviously, the most straightforward one is the sulfuric acid, but there is also one of the other technology providers in the space has another solution and \u2013 but we are certainly working with them in terms of how long it might take to \u2013 if they choose to go down that path and how long that \u2013what the phase-in or at least the requirement would be, but we are very involved. Brad Heffern : Okay. I will leave it there. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hey, good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi Phil. Phil Gresh : I just wanted to start with the return of capital, obviously the year ended up north of 140%, you are guiding to 75%, which is consistent with the guidance you have always said, but there is obviously a big delta between those two numbers, so I guess, I am wondering how you are thinking about that target relative to what you accomplished in 2016 and just taking note of the fact that 4Q did step down a bit from the rest of the year on the buybacks? Mike Ciskowski : Okay. Phil, this is Mike. We continue to spend our discretionary cash according to our capital allocation framework. When we look at how much we are going to buyback in a particular quarter, we do look at the net income, but we also consider cash flow, and so for the quarter or for 2016, we did have 142% of net income and that equated to 51% of cash flow. Phil Gresh : It\u2019s okay. So you are suggesting we should consider cash flow as a metric as well? Mike Ciskowski : Well, not suggesting that as our overall guidance, but in a lower margin environment where net income is hit with our depreciation, we do take that into consideration when we are returning to our shareholders. Joe Gorder : Phil and we have talked about this before, we set the 75% target because it\u2019s easy to see and cash flow can move around, obviously. And Mike is right, looking at net income in a low-margin environment, we set an expectation and we consider it to be kind of the floor. It\u2019s our commitment to our shareholders to the extent we can do more and it\u2019s the best use for the cash, we will go ahead and continue to buyback shares. I think the move we made with the dividend this quarter clearly reflects our comfort level and our Board\u2019s comfort level with the earnings capability of the company in a down market. And so obviously, if you look at a $2.80 dividend, it\u2019s going to continue to be a more significant component of the 75% payout ratio. We are very comfortable with that. But we will continue to buyback shares and the guys will do it in the way they have done it in the past, to some extent ratably and to some extent opportunistically. Phil Gresh : Sure. Okay, that makes sense. And if I could maybe push a little bit more on Brad\u2019s question, more from the angle of if something were to happen, maybe just talk through your system, the amount of crude you import, the amount of product you export, you gave some numbers on product exports, but maybe just what changes you think you would potentially make if this were indeed implemented? Joe Gorder : Yes. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 and I will let Gary and Jason and Lane can \u2013 we can all speak to this. But obviously, you are going to optimize your crude slate. The big question around this whole border adjustment is how are the markets going to react to it and frankly, we have read everyone of the sell side reports on this and then consulting reports, as Jason mentioned and it\u2019s got a lot of moving parts. Some people look at it on a static basis. Some have looked at it when you take into consideration the markets adjusting and some have taken into consideration the currency adjustment also. So right now, there is a skeleton out there that they are trying to put flesh on and we don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s going to look like. But I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are going to continue to optimize our operation. And if you recall, Gary, I don\u2019t remember how long ago, but we are running over 1 million barrels a day of light sweet crude and there has been times when we have run 600,000 or 700,000 barrels a day of light sweet crude. So, Phil, we have got the flexibility in the system. Gary, you want to talk at all about the markets and... Gary Simmons : Yes. So if you just look really over the last several years, our strategic objectives have been around developing feedstock flexibility and developing export markets. And so we believe that puts us in a really good position to be able to handle whatever the border tax may throw our way. Phil Gresh : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning, guys. Joe Gorder : Hi, Neil. Neil Mehta : Joe, I want to start off on the product markets here. We have seen couple of weeks of gasoline inventory builds. I want to just get your sense of what you think is going on there? Is there an issue with underlying gasoline demand? And how do you see it playing out from here? Joe Gorder : Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Neil. Gary, you want to share your thoughts? Gary Simmons : Yes. Neil, I guess to me when you look at the DOE numbers, it\u2019s always difficult this early in the year to tell a lot from the numbers. But certainly, when you look at gasoline demand, we were trending below last year\u2019s level. Last week stat showed gasoline demand really at the lower end of the 5-year range. The part to me, though, when you look at implied demand, which includes the exports, implied demand is actually tracking above last year\u2019s level, which is a little confusing. It\u2019s certainly confusing to us when we look at our operations, because what we have seen in our operations in the Gulf is we have had a number of weather impacts in the Gulf, primarily fog, which has hindered our visibility to really load ships, which hinders our ability to do the exports. So at least, in our minds, the exports in the DOEs are probably overstated, which would in turn tell you that domestic demand is understated. And so I think you will see a revision in the stats to where exports will be lowered and the domestic demand raise, but we will have to see how that plays out. Really, when you look regionally, we don\u2019t see any indication to believe that domestic demand is down. You have a few locations. We had high levels of rain on the West Coast, which hindered our demand there. You had some instances in the Upper Midwest with some ice storms, but none of that is abnormal. So I don\u2019t think we see anything that tells us demand this year is going to be dramatically different than what we saw last year. Neil Mehta : And then so Gary, what do you make of the inventory builds, is that just a function of fog and having some issues getting the product out or the refining industry running too hard in response to the strong crack to end the year last year? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I would say PADD III is definitely is a result of fog. And weather clears and you will start to see the PADD III market clear. Obviously, the concern is the PADD I market. And our hope certainly was, with less carry in the market, you would see less of an incentive to put barrels into New York harbor and store them for summer. And really, we have been on a similar trajectory is what we were last year. I think the only thing that we see that\u2019s different in the market we don\u2019t have a lot of line of sight to the barrels people are putting into tanks, but it does look to us like a lot more of the inventory this year is a winter grade gasoline which if that\u2019s true you should see play out is before RVP transition, people will have to liquidate those barrels and the market will get a little soft, but then you should see inventory cleanup before you get to gasoline season. To your comment, I do think part of this is obviously the utilization rates are just too high and we are producing more diesel and gasoline than the market can absorb. When you look at the Northwest Europe crack, it looks like this week we have gone below a level where we generally start to see some run cuts in Northwest Europe. I also believe regionally, the Rocky Mountain region, the Upper Midwest Chicago market, those markets are long and you will see some run cuts there. So, you combine that with turnaround activity and I think you will start to see inventories come back in line. Neil Mehta : That\u2019s great. And my follow-up here is for Cisco, there are lot of puts and takes in the quarter. Do you mind walking through the tax rate, which was a little bit lower, the interest expense guidance, which was a little bit different and some funkiness in other income? Mike Ciskowski : Okay. Yes, Neil, I can do that. Okay. First, on our tax rate for the quarter, we were 21% versus our guidance of 31%. We had a couple of things going on there. First, we had higher income than previously projected with most of this being in Canada and the UK, which has the lower statutory tax rate. So that was worth about 3% on the tax rate. Next on a few of our tax audits, the statute of limitations expired, therefore, we reversed reserves associated with these audits and those reversals, along with a few other small adjustments was about 7% on our tax rate. Okay. We had a few items that we did -- we chose not to identify them as special items for this earnings call, but I will walk through those. First and you talked about one already, the debt prepayment penalty. We inadvertently on our last call included that penalty in interest expense. It actually flowed through other income. That was a charge of about $42 million. Offsetting that, however, was kind of a unique item. It\u2019s the Canadian commercial paper recovery. Back in 2009, we wrote off that investment. Part of the deal, we exchanged our commercial paper for some notes. And in the fourth quarter, we received payment on those notes and that was about $50 million. So, those two kind of offset each other in other income. And then lastly, we had in the fourth quarter a LIFO charge. We had a decrement and we had a LIFO charge of about $55 million. So we chose not to identify any of these four items as a special, but I did want to go over that. So in summary, we had two expense items, the debt prepayment and the LIFO charge. We had one income item, commercial paper recovery and then we had the lower tax rates. So when you net those four items together, that was $0.02 per share on our earnings. Neil Mehta : That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. Mike Ciskowski : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Joe, one of the other, I guess, policy moving parts that has emerged in the last week or so is Keystone. Of course, OPEC, the newswires should suggest it\u2019s heavy barrels that are getting cut. So, I am just wondering what can you share with us about the dynamics of what you are seeing on the Gulf Coast specifically as it relates to how you expect the heavy differential at this kind to evolve over the next uncertain periods, I guess, that we have? Gary Simmons : You bet. Hey, Doug, this is Gary. What we have seen is we have certainly seen some impact to the OPEC cuts. Our crude allocations have been cut a little bit primarily from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. But we have seen minimal impact to our system from the cuts. We continue to see good availability of grades from Latin America, Canada and U.S. sources to replace the volumes that have been lost from OPEC. Thus far, the impact from the cuts has really been offset by lower refinery demand due to refinery turnarounds. So it will probably be April, May before the full impact if any cuts are seen. Directionally, we really didn\u2019t see the meetings to how our discounts react at all to the OPEC cuts. When the cuts were announced, you saw an increase in flat price but the discounts really didn\u2019t change. Here over the last week, the medium sour discounts have come in a little bit, but we have actually seen heavy sour discounts move wider. PMI adjusted their K factor to make [indiscernible] a little more \u2013 the discount a little wider, and I think they had to do that to compete with the Canadians. So we have seen heavy discounts actually move wider. We always look at 3% fuel oil as kind of a leading indicator of where the discounts are going. And 3% fuel oil has actually moved from 85% of Brent last week to 82% of Brent. You see fuel inventories at Singapore that are above the 5-year high. The ARB to ship fuel to Singapore is closed, so that would kind of indicate that the discounts will actually move wider. Doug Leggate : Okay. Just on the Keystone issue, I guess, I don\u2019t want to push the point too much, because I realized how much uncertainty there is, but I seem to recall in the past that you guys had \u2013 maybe I have got this wrong with talking about becoming an anchor shipper with an option to even acquire interest on that. Have I got that wrong or is that back in the table? Gary Simmons : Well, so we are a shipper. We are still a strong supporter of Keystone. We don\u2019t have the ability to actually be an owner in the line. So, we are working with TransCanada as they try to better understand the executive order and drum up customer support. Our belief is that the direct connection from the Western Canadian production to the U.S. Gulf Coast is a good thing, because we have the most efficient capacity to really process those growing areas of production. Our intent, again, will be to process those barrels in our system, not to export the barrels. Doug Leggate : Okay, I appreciate that. If I could just squeeze in a last one because that was kind of a follow-up, I guess, but Joe, you have put it down in \u2013 but I realized you addressed there earlier, but I just want to ask you a question about that very quickly, it\u2019s become the MO, I guess of your tenure as CEO, the return to shareholders, what are you thinking now in terms of the dividend yield, because you are not sitting, if not the highest, pretty close to the highest yield in the sector, is that kind of \u2013 do you have a target in mind, do you have an idea of how that dividend growth can evolve relative to buybacks, just what are you thinking in terms of the overall balance of one versus the other, I leave it there? Thanks. Joe Gorder : Thanks Doug. The yield obviously is a function of the stock price. And we can\u2019t control the stock price. What we can control is how we reward the shareholders of the company and how confident we feel about our ability to produce cash flows, free cash flows within the company, that we try to manage, right and we do it through a capital allocation framework that Mike mentioned earlier. The dividend and our maintenance CapEx is non-discretionary in our minds and it will continue to be. So making commitments to our shareholder returns through the dividend is something that we don\u2019t take lightly and we modeled extensively. The buybacks and the growth projects, organic capital projects and acquisitions are areas that we consider to be competing for the use of free cash flow. And we look at the timing on our project development activities. We look at the return on our projects that Lane and his team are developing and that Rich and Martin have and we compared it to the value of buying back shares. And so we make the decisions accordingly to provide the highest returns for the shareholder. I would tell you, I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I would be lying to you if I told you that we look at the absolute yield and say that is what determines our decision around the dividend policy. It\u2019s more how do we feel about the cash flows that we can produce within the system. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the answer Joe. And I guess we will see you in a couple of weeks. Thanks. Joe Gorder : Doug thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Johannes Van Der Tuin : Hi. Thanks for taking the call. It\u2019s Johannes here. I have to pinch hit today unfortunately for you all, but fortunate for me. Thank you for taking the call. Joe Gorder : Glad to hear. Johannes Van Der Tuin : The first question, I guess has to do with the other big policy that\u2019s not border adjustment taxes, but it\u2019s being pushed aside for the moment, but still probably later important to you and that\u2019s RINs, you mentioned it earlier up in the call, and what\u2019s your progress are you seeing in terms of trying to move the point of obligation or engaging with the EPA as there has been a transition, I know that Scott Pruitt is not in his seat yet, but nonetheless, if you have got any sort of color on that. And then would you expect the RIN market to move before any sort of policy change once there is some sort of color clarity on which direction it\u2019s going or are you modeling out for 2017 with the higher RIN expense because you don\u2019t think the market is going to move? Joe Gorder : Okay, fair enough. Jason, you want to take the crack in our RIN? Jason Fraser : Sure. Yes. To talk about the point of obligation effort meant maybe somebody else can speak to the RIN price. The comment on our petition to change the point of obligation is February 22, so that period is still open and there is till comments being generated. We firmly believe that once all the evidence is reviewed, the EPA is going to agree to the change the point of obligation. Regarding the introduction of the process, the Attorney General Pruitt as EPA Administrator, which has been there is some discussion about that is whether that will change the dynamic. In his confirmation hearing, he said he would administer the RFS in accordance with Congress\u2019 statutory objectives and he would make a decision based on the evidence and their administrative record. And it all sounds great to us, that\u2019s all we would ever ask for. So we think that after hearing all the arguments and reviewing the facts and what\u2019s in the record and consulting with the staff that they are going to agree that it should be moved. So we don\u2019t really see anything changed due to this changeover of administrators. Johannes Van Der Tuin : And then on the actual RIN price and the trading price? Gary Simmons : Yes. So again, our view is certainly you would see a reaction in the market if this gets done. And you would see RINs come off, we have seen some market reaction already. It\u2019s difficult for us to model because of all the uncertainty around it, so. Joe Gorder : But yes, I guess Gary, we started the year like $0.95 per RIN and now it\u2019s like at $0.50. Gary Simmons : Right. Joe Gorder : So we have made the point all along that this is a market that we believe is right for manipulation and the fact that you have had this movement in it, it sure is based on fundamentals. Johannes Van Der Tuin : It sounds good. So hopefully, there will be some movement. The other question I have I guess just had to do with the California margin weakness, clearly, the margin environment in California has come off quite a bit over the last six months, do you see an underlying reason for that, what the big driver is, is there a difference in the way the market clearing, is it just the Torrance has come back online, is there some sort of dynamic whether it would be weather or something else in terms of EMT that you would like to say, king of just curious as to what\u2019s going on out there for you rise on an operational basis? Joe Gorder : Well, I certainly think Torrance coming back online has impacted the market here in the prompt market. As I mentioned, we saw some weaker demand with RIN on the West Coast. But overall, LA is moving to summer grade expect today, which you pull butane out of the pool, which directionally tightens it [ph], next month, the bay will go to summer grade gasoline. So all of those things should directionally help demand and bring supply and demand back into balance. Johannes Van Der Tuin : Okay. So you don\u2019t see any sort of a grinding issue there? Gary Simmons : No. Johannes Van Der Tuin : Okay, perfect. Thank you very much for taking the call. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng : Hi guys, good morning. Joe Gorder : Good Paul. Paul Cheng : I have to apologize first. I joined late, so my question, you already addressed, just let me know, I will take it offline. Two questions, if I may. First, if I am looking at the Contango curve, their current structure seems to suggest that you want to build inventory because that May and June, the margin was very high for gasoline, on the other hand, the stock is high right now, so just curious that internally for Valero, how you guys contemplate on those diverging forces and when you plan one, how you go with the process? Gary Simmons : Yes. Paul for us, most of our tankage is more operational in nature, so we don\u2019t do a lot of storage plays to take advantage of the market structure. We do some of it especially on the crude side, but it\u2019s more related to buying opportunistic barrels that we believe have wide discounts and then you can also take advantage of the markets structure. But overall, we don\u2019t do a lot of that. Paul Cheng : But I mean with inventory, at that high today Gary, is that influencing your decision that you may want to slowdown your run, even if the physical asset availability is there or that you don\u2019t really do that just because you are off the game favorably, that if you slow other people it is going to take up the slack anyway, so you are just going to max out your production even though you may build inventory yourself? Gary Simmons : Yes. I think to me, the key on the inventory build is that what we are seeing out in the market is a lot of winter grade gasoline. And so our view is that those barrels are going to have to clear before we have our VP transition. And as those barrels clear, it will bring the market down and you will see economic run cuts and lower utilization while those barrels clear before we actually going to summer driving season. Joe Gorder : Yes. But Gary, you are not suggesting that its Valero, it\u2019s going to make the run cut? Gary Simmons : No, that\u2019s right. Joe Gorder : I mean Paul, we are the lowest cash operating cost guys in the business and we don\u2019t have any strong interest in balancing the market ourselves. Paul Cheng : Very good. If I may the second question is that, maybe this is either for Lane or for Gary also. I am looking at the margin capture RIN, system-wide in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s about 56%, 57%, which is 6% lower than the third quarter and 21% lower from the year ago level and if you are looking at your last 5- year average, it\u2019s about 65%, 66% and this year, it\u2019s about 60%, just curious that is that just a \u2013 because of the rising oil price or what \u2013 is there anything that you can see structurally, what then you will see in your system or that in the market new condition to make you believe that this year, the 60% margin capture weight is what the future may look like or that this is really more of an one-off certain items impacting that? Gary Simmons : Yes. Paul, this is Gary. I will take it. Mike started the call with some comments that we took a LIFO charge in the fourth quarter of \u201816 and really, that LIFO charge explains the third quarter to fourth quarter variants that you talked about. It also explains a portion of the fourth quarter \u201815 versus fourth quarter \u201816 results. In addition to that, we had a couple other items. There is really nothing operational that I see, but the other big things that affect the year-over-year results. In \u201815, the blenders tax credit was enacted in December of \u201815 and so all of the credit was booked in the fourth quarter of \u201815, whereas in \u201816, that blenders tax credit was kind of spread out through the year so that had an impact on the capture rates. And the other big thing that we are looking at in terms of the capture rates is just the cost of the RINs. So in the fourth quarter of \u201815, RINs were around $0.49, whereas the fourth quarter of \u201816, they were $0.96. And so that delta in the cost of RINs also impacts our capture rates and that really is the bulk of it. Paul Cheng : Gary, I mean, this certainly explains for the quarter. And for the year, RIN probably is part of the explanation. But for the full year of 60% capture rate also seems quite low comparing to the last several years what you have been able to achieve? Gary Simmons : Yes, we can dive it into it more with John, I would suggest. But those are really the big items that we see. We don\u2019t really see anything operational, Paul. Paul Cheng : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : I will leave some of the policy to decide for now, but I guess specific question for you. Exports have been a huge part on the product side, 2016 story looks like a good start to \u201817. Pemex is out saying they intend to run a lot better in \u201817 than \u201816. That\u2019s their forecast. I mean, we will see what turns out to be true, but could you characterize maybe the incremental growth in exports for you as to where that\u2019s gone and if Pemex were to run better in \u201817, is that a risk we need be concerned about or are there enough other growth areas internationally? Gary Simmons : Yes, Roger. It\u2019s hard to tell. As Lane can tell you, it takes a long time to improve refinery mechanical availability, so we will see what happens there. But I think, one of the things that we are looking at and we export to Mexico and to South America and certainly when you look at a lot of the consultant views where Brazil has had negative demand growth over the last couple of years that are forecasting some decent demand growth in Brazil, so even if we are to lose some volume into Mexico, I think you could be absorbed in other locations in South America. Roger Read : Okay. And then second question, M&A, I know with some of the policy uncertainty, maybe sellers don\u2019t want to sell and buyers want to be a little questionable. But I was wondering, Joe, as you kind of think about the longer plan here, Lyondell pulled their unit off the market, but maybe some of the other opportunities that exist there right now? Joe Gorder : Mike, you want to speak to this? Mike Ciskowski : Well, yes, Lyondell did pull their refinery back for now. Other than a few things on the West Coast, there are no opportunities really for the refining space presently. Roger Read : Well, that was brief. And I heard that Lane was a miracle worker, so maybe we could get him to work for Pemex that will fix them? Joe Gorder : No, we don\u2019t want to do that. But Roger, you are right, I mean, what Mike said is exactly right and it was characterized earlier. The Lyondell refinery is a nice opportunity, but they chose not to sell it. And we are just not seeing a lot of refining assets that are for sale that would add any value to Valero\u2019s portfolio. So from an acquisition perspective, what do you focus on? You focus on the opportunities in logistics and other areas where you could improve the earnings capability of the company by improving your logistics, your feeds in, your products out, and then potentially upgrading your stream. So we are not in a position \u2013 we don\u2019t believe we are in a position where we have got to go do a deal to balance on our portfolio. We will look at this a little differently and then we continue to seek ways to try to improve the quality of the portfolio we have got in place. Roger Read : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi Chow : Thanks. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi, Chi. Chi Chow : Hi. Mike, do you have the cash balance held by the company\u2019s international subsidiaries as of year end \u201816? We have noticed that balance has been steadily growing over the last couple of years. I was just wondering if you could also talk about whether, one, that cash is available for use for domestic CapEx and capital returns to shareholders. Two, what are their \u2013 are there any repatriation inefficiencies in the current tax structure? And then third, how do some of the tax policy changes proposed under the new administration impact repatriation of that cash going forward? Mike Ciskowski : Okay. Roughly at the end of the year, we had about $2 billion of cash that was in the UK and in Canada. So presently \u2013 okay, our current structure that we have today would allow us to move most of the cash back to the U.S. without incurring a significant tax penalty. We haven\u2019t needed to do that presently given where our U.S. cash balance is as well. Joe Gorder : That was an incredibly clever way to ask three questions. Chi Chow : That\u2019s all related, right. Joe Gorder : That was good. Chi Chow : Well, do you feel the need, any urgency to get that cash back given the potential changes in the repatriation policies going forward here? Joe Gorder : The need to get it back, I don\u2019t think we have a sense of need to get it back. Would it be nice to have access to it? And Jason and the team are looking at the repatriation implications of the border tax adjustment. You always want to have your cash totally accessible to you. So, it will be great to get it back. But I would tell you that this \u2013 let\u2019s just assume that we are able to bring it back and bring it back in good shape. The question is that what do you do with it? You reinvest it in the business? I don\u2019t see us changing our approach to capital if we had the cash back, okay. I mean, I don\u2019t think Lane is going to say gee whiz, now I can do a whole bunch more, because we are not holding back on things that we are doing today. So it will be wonderful to have access to it without paying any tax on it. That\u2019s not likely. But I don\u2019t think it changes anything we are doing, Chi. Chi Chow : Great. I will leave it there. Thanks, Joe. Appreciate it. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with UBS Securities. Spiro Dounis : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for squeezing us in here. Just wanted to follow up on the RFS. Without getting into what does it look like and then when does it change, just thinking about, I mean, I guess, an environment where the point of obligation has actually moved away from the refiners, just curious in terms of the reaction or just change in behavior on your part, maybe the refining industry in general, what are some of the things you think happens, I guess, on day 1 without the point of obligation? I think one thing we think about maybe is that exports actually go down, because of course, that\u2019s a good way to avoid the RIN. Just curious if you are thinking about anything else in terms of changes in product mix? Joe Gorder : Gary, you want to? Gary Simmons : Yes, I don\u2019t know that to some degree, the export market has over time recognized the RIN, so I don\u2019t really know that it really changes the dynamics of the export markets that much if the point of obligation moves. Joe Gorder : Yes, I mean we have all adjusted to this. Really, the frustrating thing from our perspective is the negative effect it has by shifting the value of doing business from us to the guidance capturing the RIN. And so obviously, it would be beneficial to Valero if the point of obligation moved, which would reduce our burden. And frankly, we believe it would take a lot of the speculation and the manipulation opportunities out of that RIN market and it should lower the price of RINs. Now, the RVOs will have a factor on that and so on. But from a refiner, from an independent refiner\u2019s perspective, it will be positive. Spiro Dounis : Appreciate the color. Thanks, everyone. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Dietert with Simmons. Jeff Dietert : Good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Dietert : I am sitting here in Houston looking out my back window and the fog has cleared in the Houston ship channel, so hopefully, that\u2019s good news. Joe Gorder : It is good news. Yes, do you see our ships loading, Jeff? Jeff Dietert : They are going out one right after another. I had a question on your pace of the MLP drops and there are a few things going on, one of your peers accelerating, there is also the potential for lower corporate and individual tax rates under the Trump administration, potential for higher interest rates, how do these things impact your thinking on MLP valuations and the attractiveness of dropdowns? Joe Gorder : Rich, you want to? Rich Lashway : Yes. I will take a crack at our peers accelerating. So we have been pretty consistent in the execution of our strategy from the IPO that we are going to take a very measured pace. We believe that that\u2019s more of prudent to have a measured pace on our dropdowns. Valero\u2019s exceeded their targeted total payout ratio for the past 2 years. VLP doesn\u2019t really need to do any acquisitions or dropdowns to meet our distribution growth. There is not a need for the cash as we have kind of talked about, the cash balance at Valero. So we are just going to stick to our measured approach of growing, focusing on growing the distributions. We have been clear that we are growing distributions in \u201817 at 25% and at least 20% in \u201818. So it\u2019s really the focus is on the distribution growth at VLP. And we have got the coverage to achieve this and without doing anything drops. Joe Gorder : And then Jeff, the tail on that was tax rate changes. Mike Ciskowski : I mean the lower corporate tax rate, if that\u2019s what gets put in place, obviously would make the corporation a little more attractive. However, the MLP will still have the tax advantages structure versus the corporation. Joe Gorder : In interest rates, I mean it just \u2013 it provides an investor different option, right. But you still have the benefits of everything that you have today with an MLP ownership position. Jeff Dietert : Thanks for taking the questions. Joe Gorder : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd : Hi. Thank you. You may have touched on parts of this over the course of the call and I apologize if I missed some of that. But can you talk through what you see as some of the similarities and differences as we look at the macro environment versus last year at this time margins are a little bit better, but we have seen some pretty significant inventory builds over the last four weeks again, I mean what are some of the lingering challenges that are maybe similar to last year and what\u2019s different this year that gives you confidence that we won\u2019t just repeat the 2016 environment again? Gary Simmons : Yes. This is Gary. I think the similarities, we continue to see the industry running at high utilization rates and so the production of gasoline and distillate is exceeding demand in the marketplace, which isn\u2019t good, causing inventories to build. The difference we see is it looks like on the gasoline side a lot of what\u2019s being put into inventory is winter grade. So again, our view is this will have to clear before RVP transitions could bring inventories down before gasoline season starts, which would make this year look different than what we saw last year and should lead to better gasoline cracks. On the distillate side, not too much different I think the things that we are seeing on the distillate side is slightly better demand. So year-over-year, we will have a little colder weather here in the U.S. and also in Northwest Europe, which may distillate demand. And then as we see some resurgence in the upstream, the drilling activity, it also leads to a little better incremental diesel demand. So those are kind of the key factors we are looking at in the market. Joe Gorder : And you are right, we don\u2019t know enough yet about the infrastructure projects that are being talked about, at the Federal level right now, what the implications of those are. But any time you get projects like this taking place, they tend to drive distillate demand, of course it would drive gasoline demands also. But \u2013 then there is the other things, petrochemical feeds, asphalt, things like that. So we are actually encouraged by the outlook and by the focus on the infrastructure within the U.S. So we will just see how it all plays out. Ryan Todd : So I guess at a high level, it\u2019s safe to say you have just \u2013 is your view on \u201817, but it\u2019s still a little bit better that \u201816, but we will wait and see, is that...? Gary Simmons : Yes. I think definitely, we will see the gasoline market being similar to \u201816, but a slightly better diesel market than \u201816. Ryan Todd : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez : Gents, good morning. I am not sure I\u2019m as good as, but I am going to do my best at least two in for one here. The question is on pipelines, I know you talked about Keystone, but I am curious for one, do you have a sense of what the current transport cost is in the market and where that might go to once the pipe is in the ground. And then secondly on dapple, can you think of any direct maybe indirect positive impacts that you may have, whether it\u2019s just additional crude, light sweet on the Gulf Coast? Thanks. Gary Simmons : Yes, that\u2019s some of the things that we are working with TransCanada on, so we don\u2019t really have guidance on where the Keystone itself tariff is going to be and that\u2019s certainly something that we are working with them on. In terms of dapple, yes I think you kind of hit on it, it\u2019s definitely will be bringing more light sweet to the Gulf Coast, which should be good for us. Blake Fernandez : Good deal. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Faisel Khan : Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Faisel. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just going back to Excel for a second and back to I think Doug\u2019s question, have you guys talked to them about taking an equity interest in the pipeline, I mean now that you have the sort of the MLP up and running, it might make sense for them to have an equity partner with their anchor shipper? Joe Gorder : Faisel, you should never ask us that question when you got a guy who is responsible for the MLP in the room. But to answer your question, honestly, no, we haven\u2019t talked about an equity stake in Keystone. Faisel Khan : Only because it might make sense for them to syndicate out some of that risk, given how large the pipeline is, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s? Joe Gorder : That maybe true, but that does not mean that we would be the guy. Faisel Khan : Along with the price. Joe Gorder : That\u2019s right. Faisel Khan : Okay. Thanks guys. Joe Gorder : You bet. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Joe Gorder : Sure Craig. Craig Shere : Quick follow-up on Phil and Doug\u2019s questions about capital deployment and buyback questions, it seems that the buybacks were kind of turbocharged little bit in \u201816 when shares were more in the mid-$50 area versus in the $60-plus area, as you think about flexing buyback metrics from earnings to cash flow in a low margin environment, how does the share price itself factor into your analysis? Joe Gorder : Mike, you want to? Mike Ciskowski : Well, I mean we don\u2019t have specific seasonal targets for our buybacks. It\u2019s on an annual basis, at least 75% of net income. And our program does consist of both somewhat ratable purchases, but also opportunistic purchases, too. So we just evaluate when we want to accelerate that depending on the stock price. Craig Shere : Is it fair to say that the mid-$50 area is kind of turbocharged area for you? Joe Gorder : We couldn\u2019t answer that question. But \u2013 and I think Mike answered it properly. It\u2019s \u2013 we sure don\u2019t want to signal our timing on our buying, but we look at what we view to be the earnings capability of this company. And if the returns on the buybacks are better than the returns on the growth CapEx project, then we are going to buyback shares. We said for years that we are not going to hoard cash, to the extent that we produce free cash flow. We will continue to look at the buybacks. Craig Shere : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey : Hi guys. Good morning. Forgive me if this has been asked\u2026. Joe Gorder : Paul, where have you been? Paul Sankey : On the Exxon \u2013 let\u2019s be honest, that it may be way \u2013 further to an earlier comment about the Houston ship and all the good news for you from New York is that it\u2019s snowing very heavily here, so there should be a bit more gas flow demand, I guess. Guys, I am sorry if you asked this \u2013 answered this already, but what\u2019s the latency on the border adjusted tax and what are you doing, I guess you have to some level plan for the potential for that to happen, what would you do if it did occur, so I guess the question is what\u2019s your understanding of the likelihood of that happens and what would be your response to if it did? Thanks. Joe Gorder : Okay. Jason did talk to that earlier. Just want to give him the likelihood and then we can talk, Gary or we can talk about the other components of that question. Jason Fraser : Yes. We really at this stage, we haven\u2019t put a handicap on the likelihood yet. It\u2019s so early, we don\u2019t even have any draft on legislative tax floating around the committee, so we don\u2019t feel it\u2019s proper for us to try to guesstimate that now. Joe Gorder : And then Gary as far as well \u2013 Paul, it comes down to how are the markets going to react to this, right. And we have read all of the reports and we have read the consultants reports. Something is going to be good for refining, something that may not be as good for refining. And we talked earlier about the fact that we can adjust for the crude slate. But Gary, the markets are going to react. Gary Simmons : Yes. So everything we have been doing is to increase de-stock flexibility and also be able to grow these export markets and both those things aligned well with this and we can optimize the system around border tax. Paul Sankey : I guess the punch line kind of goes back to 2010 to \u201814 when we were trying to maximize usage of U.S. light sweets, where did you end up on all that, how much more could you use at the end of the process and do you have any numbers to illustrate the flexibility? Gary Simmons : Yes. So if you look in our IR presentation, I think its Slide 9, it does a pretty good job of going through how we can swing our system between individual grades. We got to where we were processing over 1 million barrels a day of domestic light sweet crude, I guess that was pretty tougher, so we have added some additional capacity since that time as well so. Joe Gorder : The interesting thing was, I guess at Port Arthur, you were able to increase overall run rates, throughput rates, because we were running the lighter slate. So Paul, we will be able to flex the system to deal with it. I guess the question is how to \u2013 how do the global crude markets respond to the duty, do they price to continue to push their barrels into the market or do they find a different home. And I think Gary has made the comment in several of the meetings that we have had that the natural home for a lot of the heavy sour crudes tends to be in the U.S. Gulf Coast refining system. So I don\u2019t know if that changes in any material way. Paul Sankey : Absolutely and I guess, the other question is we would assume the gasoline prices at the pump would go up pretty much by the amount of the tax in the short-term? Joe Gorder : Look that is certainly what we have read also, okay. And I think your friends at Goldman did a report here recently that I have gotten to study, but I thought okay, maybe they moved up and then they move back down, something rise, the market suggest to it. So Paul, the interesting thing is because this is kind of a topic du jour, right. But none of us \u2013 they got the skeleton out there and the House seems very committed to this today. But they don\u2019t have the flesh on the bones. There is lots of conversations that are taking place around do you have carve-outs, don\u2019t you have carve-outs and so on. I think what I have encouraged our investor base to do is just let\u2019s be patient, not over-reactive and let\u2019s just see how it shakes out. We will adjust to maximize the value to the company, but I don\u2019t think anybody knows enough yet to really understand what the full implications are. And then when we have seen changes like this, the markets tend to respond. So here again, we don\u2019t have a great deal of concern and consternation around us right now. We are just trying to understand it better. Paul Sankey : Yes. I totally understand. Thank you very much. Joe Gorder : You bet. Operator : And thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. John Locke for closing remarks. John Locke : Okay. Well, thanks everybody. And we appreciate you joining us today. Please contact me after the call if you have any additional questions. Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to the Valero Energy Corporation Reports 2017 First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. My name is Vanessa and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Locke, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations & Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Now, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under Federal securities laws. These are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our team again delivered solid operating results and distinctive financial performance during a quarter where we saw heavy maintenance activity and soft margins. Our continued focus on safety and reliability in our plants has been key to our ability to capture the available margin. In the first quarter, we saw healthy domestic and export demand for refined products driven by low prices, seasonal weather conditions in North America and Europe, and a resurgence of domestic oil patch activity. Latin America also continued to be a strong source of demand for gasoline and diesel. On the crude supply side, we continued to see rig count increases in the U.S., particularly in the Permian Basin. As production ramps up and more domestic sweet crude makes its way to the Gulf Coast our refineries in the Mid-Continent and the Gulf Coast are prepared to capture the feedstock opportunities. While RIN prices have declined relative to 2016 there's still a significant headwind for the quarter. At this level, RIN's expense remains an issue for us, so we continue to work with regulators. Turning to our refining segment, in the first quarter we completed a heavy turnaround schedule at our Benicia, Texas City, St. Charles, and Meraux refineries. Our employees and contractors safely executed these projects. With the majority of our planned maintenance for the year behind us, we should be ready to capture available market opportunities. In our ethanol business, we had record production volumes for the quarter as higher ethanol prices and strong demand for ethanol exports supported production rates. Also in the first quarter, we invested $641 million of sustaining and growth capital, construction is progressing on the Diamond Pipeline with completion expected at the end of this year. Work on the Diamond Green Diesel plant expansion, the Houston alkylation unit and the Wilmington cogeneration plant is continuing as planned. Turning to our MLP, as we disclosed in our 10-K for 2016, we created a new VLP segment to align how we manage and allocate resources. Growth in our VLP segment is critical to Valero's strategy to optimize the supply chain. The third party acquisition of the Red River pipeline in January is a good example of VLP executing this strategy, which is focused on assets that are key to Valero's operations or that will supply third party volumes without taking on commodity risk. Lastly, regarding cash returns to stockholders, we paid $629 million in cash through dividends and stock buybacks. So, we believe we're in good shape to exceed our payout target for the year. This payout demonstrates the company's free cash flow generating capability even in a soft margin environment. So, with that, John, I'll hand it back over to you. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you, Joe. For the first quarter, net income attributable to Valero's stockholders was $305 million, or $0.68 per share, compared to $495 million or $1.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016. First quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $283 million, or $0.60 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to page three of the financial tables that accompany our release. Operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2017 was $647 million, compared to $915 million for the first quarter of 2016, which has been revised retrospectively to reflect the new VLP segment. First quarter 2017 operating income was in line with first quarter of 2016 adjusted operating income of $652 million. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which was in line with the first quarter of 2016. Our refineries operated at 91% throughput capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2017, which reflects turnarounds that occurred at the Benicia, Texas City, St. Charles, and Meraux refineries. Refining cash operating expense of $3.85 per barrel were $0.39 per barrel higher than the first quarter of 2016, mainly due to a higher level of maintenance activity and higher energy costs in the first quarter of 2017. The ethanol segment generated $22 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $39 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter of 2016 was $9 million. The increase from the 2016 adjusted amount was primarily due to the higher ethanol prices and record production volumes. Operating income for the VLP segment in the first quarter of 2017 was $70 million compared to $43 million in the first quarter of 2016. The primary drivers for the increase in operating income are contributions from the McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers Terminal and the Red River Pipeline which were acquired subsequent to the first quarter of last year. The Red River Pipeline operations, acquired in January, have been integrated into VLP and are performing as expected. For the first quarter of 2017, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation, were $190 million and net interest expense was $121 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $500 million and the effective tax rate was 26% in the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate was lower than expected, mainly due to a reduction in the statutory rate in Quebec and favorable settlements from several state income tax audits. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $8.5 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.5 billion, of which $66 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 24.1%. We have $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $720 million was available for only VLP. We generated $988 million of cash from operating activities in the first quarter, excluding a working capital benefit of $151 million, net cash generated was $837 million. With regard to investing activities, we made $641 million of growth and sustaining capital investments, of which $245 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. Moving to financing activities, we returned $629 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $315 million in dividend payments and $314 million for the purchase of 4.7 million shares of Valero common stock. As of March 31st, we had approximately $2.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Our guidance for 2017 capital expenditures of $2.7 billion remains unchanged. This amount which includes turnarounds, catalyst, and joint venture investments consists of approximately $1.6 billion for sustaining and $1.1 billion for growth. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.69 million to 1.74 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 285,000 to 305,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 455,000 to 475,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $3.70 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash cost, such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation for the second quarter, to be around $170 million, and net interest expense should be about $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $500 million, and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 30%. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their questions too. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. You had some positive market commentary in your press release this morning. I'm just curious to hear your thoughts around product balances for refining runs (12:13) expected to pick up strongly, and where you expect the demand to come to meet that? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. Benny, I think what we've seen is early \u2013 and I'll talk about gasoline first. Earlier in the year, we saw that gasoline demand looked to be down a little bit and when we looked at the data more specifically, you could see it was a lot weather related, especially on the West Coast, you had a rainy season which caused demand to be down. As we progressed through the quarter, our March volumes looked to be fairly consistent with what we saw last year. So I think we think domestic demand will be fairly consistent with what we saw last year, but we're seeing a stronger pull on exports than what we saw last year, particularly Latin America, there appears to be a good pull of gasoline into Mexico and South America. On the distillate side, really for the whole first quarter we saw slightly better distillate demand, some of that was due to a little bit colder weather. We've seen good agricultural demand and then as we start to see the upstream recover, we're starting to see a pull there as well, on the distillates. And then distillates exports are also strong, again same \u2013 we're seeing some exports to Europe, but mainly strong export demand into Latin America. Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Really appreciate that color. And just in regards to splitting of the VLP results, can we read into this as a signal to expect a lot more growth in dropdown activity in this area? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: You know, we don't provide guidance on our dropdowns as it relates to the VLP. We're in good shape. We do provide the distribution growth plans for the next two years, but we have high coverage rate at the LP, and so we're not going to provide any of the dropdown guidance. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: And Benny, I think, and John can talk a little bit too, he and Mike, we went through this process of trying to decide, did we want to go ahead and create the segment. We felt we needed to create the segment so that there was more line of sight to what it is, and then the question becomes, what do you put in the segment? We decided to keep it as clean as possible and just be sure that everybody had a line of sight to the fact that this is the way we manage the business, and we wanted it to be very clear and clean. So the portfolio of assets that we have at Valero that are still droppable, all of that EBITDA that's droppable into VLP is there, but we didn't want to cloud it by including that. So anyway, it's a pretty straight up segment. Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for the color. Appreciate it guys. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Phil. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question, just wanted to come back to Joe, your commentary on RINs. Do you view that the quarterly run rate here as a fair number for the full year? I think you're expecting a higher number when we were coming out of last quarter. And then just generally, your thoughts on what's happening right now, thoughts on the preliminary RVO standard point of obligation potential. I know there was a hearing going on yesterday where the U.S. Appeals Court was questioning the EPA's authorities, and suggesting Congress should be responsible for fixing the renewable fuel standards. So it seems like there's a lot of information out there. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. Phil, that's a good question, and I'll let Gary talk a little bit about the RIN market, and then Jason can just give you an update on the regulatory front, if that's okay. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: So, I think, we certainly saw, especially D6 RINs call off early in the year. We're not really ready to revise our guidance at this time. We're going to keep our guidance where it is, and we'll just see how successful we are on some of these things about moving the point of obligation and what happens to RINs. Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: And regarding the 2018 \u2013 regarding the timeline for releasing the 2018 RVO targets, we think they're going to try to hit the November 30th deadline. They're going to try to stay on target. To meet that, they need to push the proposed rule out by late May or early June. And on those oral arguments you mentioned that occurred yesterday on the lawsuit relating to the 2014 to 2016 RFS targets, we understand there were a lot of questions, and the judges were pushing the EPA on the grounds that they'd used to grant the waiver in their questions. I think they were kind of signaling that maybe the EPA could have used another ground which had been even more defensible than the one that they did. They based it on the inadequate domestic supply of biofuels versus causing severe economic harm. But we wouldn't read too much into the questions at oral argument. We do think the EPA properly issued the waiver when they did it and one thing that we would note is in the arguments and the questions from the judges, it was clear to us that our arguments at the point of obligation should be evaluated in setting the RVO numbers which was what we claimed in the case had some traction. The judges seem to buy into that, so we were encouraged by that. Now, on what we think is going to happen with the point of obligation overall. Kind of to give you an update on the process we're going through, the comment deadline on our petition to change the point of obligation was February 22nd. The EPA has now received all of the comments and they're receiving them. We think the majority of the comments that were filed are in favor of our position and with the new team at the EPA we're really hopeful. We think when they look at the facts we expect them to resolve this question in our favor. And on timing which is what a lot of people are asking, there's no specific deadline on the EPA. We think they're diligently looking at this and there's a lot of concern and urgency because of the harm the high RIN prices are doing to the refining sector, so we think it could be done in the next six months if they push it. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great, that's very helpful. I appreciate the color. Second question would just be on light-medium, and light-heavy differentials. We started to see some timing here in the second quarter which I presume is mostly due to the effects of the OPEC cuts starting to flow through. Is that consistent what you guys have been seeing out there? And generally how are you thinking about light-medium, light-heavy differentials? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. I think that is consistent. We saw that when OPEC announced their cuts that there wasn't a big market reaction and I think a lot of that was we feel like there was a demand offset to the supply offset, so we had lower refinery demand with turnaround season and then they weren't burning as much oil, so there wasn't that much of an impact. And then we also think that a disproportionate amount of cuts went to the Far East and not to the U.S. market. As the U.S. has come out of turnaround season you're seeing a bigger impact of those cuts on the medium to light differential and I think where we are is we just kind of are waiting to see if really the OPEC countries are committed to our market or not. So far they've kind of sent the volume they want to send, but we got in last week where the differentials were to the point where economic signals were starting to point us to switch to a more domestic light sweet diet and back out the medium sour from the Middle East. What we've seen this week it's starting to widen back out, so I think they recognized that and I think they're committed to maintaining market share here and we've kind of seen a floor on that medium to light spread because you started to see refinery switch to the lighter diet and so this week it's improved about $0.50 from where we were last week. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey guys, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I think this maybe for Gary, the first question. Gary, I believe you guys had mentioned you're spending about $350 million a month in the secondary costs outside of feedstock which means that (20:27) to bring either the feedstock or the crude or the product from pond to pond (20:31) and that is a major area where that you think optimization and improvement could be. Could you give us an example what could be done and how big is the magnitude. Are we talking a about potential 10% is the reasonable medium term objective of benefit or higher or lower and any kind of a number that you can share? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Paul, so it's really impossible for us to give guidance in theory because so much of what's rolled into this is outside of our control, so just to give you an example, freight rates play a big role in that overall $350 million of spend. Things that we're doing is renegotiating terminal deals that we have, making sure that our barge utilization is efficient as it can and so what we'll try to do is work with John. We have some dashboarding tools that we're using to measure our progress and we'll try to work with him to see if there's something we can share with you guys going forward, but I can't really give you a dollar target. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. A second one, Joe, in terms of the organic investment opportunity in the company, where do you see the biggest opportunity for the next, say, two or three years? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Paul, I think it's in the refining side of the business, in the midstream side of the business. I'll let Lane talk a little bit about the projects that we've got going on in refining and then maybe Rich wants to share a little bit about anything we got going on on the logistics side, but Rich don't tell them anything secret. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: We will keep it a secret here. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: I know you would, Paul. All right. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Paul, this is Lane. We still have a strategic outlook of what we think, we are always looking at our assets with respect to feedstock flexibility. And really there's two lines that we invest there. One is to look at the natural capital arbitrage as it sits in refining to make sure we can fill it out the way we'd like and make sure we have access to the right feedstock. The other way we invest in that is, here's Rich's area and that's getting connectivity to terminals or get docks with respect to getting the products out or the feedstocks in, so really when we think about feedstock flexibility, it's really the opportunity to invest both in refining and logistics. We also have sort of a long-term outlook that we think octane is going to be valuable and we're in the process of building our Houston alky, we're looking at other octane capability throughout our system and so that's really the other one. And the final one is we're building the cogens at both Wilmington and we're looking at one at Pembroke and this is in response to what we think that natural gas price where there's an arbitrage between how the utilities are going to provide power costs versus our ability to make it ourselves using natural gas. Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.: Paul, this is Rich. Part of the organic stuff that we've got going on is we've been vocal about the Diamond Pipeline. That's gone through the DRB process and has full funding approval. We're about 40% complete on that. Going forward, the organic stuff that we look at kind of is supportive of Gary's $350 million of secondary costs which are pipelines and terminal expenses and we look at opportunities to organically grow into some of these markets and get around third-party costs. So Gary's secondary costs provide us an opportunity to look at organic projects. And again, we can't talk about those because they're still going through the gating process, but for this year the billion dollars of strategic capital, about 50% of that is for logistics projects to address some of Gary's secondary costs and we expect that that kind of thinking or that kind of strategic capital going forward would continue. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Paul, just more broadly on this. We've talked about the fact that we're interested from a strategic perspective in integrating more assets that go into the refinery and moving product out of the refinery. And that's not a short-term strategy that's a long-term strategy. Along with the other things that we're doing. Safety, reliability and environmental focus and then shareholder returns is the third component. So I think, the strategy that we've got in place today, certainly we have line of sight to the next couple of years, but it's a strategy that I believe works long-term. It allows us to continue to increase the value of the business. So we're very comfortable with it. And again, Rich and Lane are both developing projects, we scrub them hard and then we'll just see which ones we want to proceed with going forward. But the focus is clearly around the core business of refining and marketing and around ethanol. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Unknown Speaker : Hey, guys, good morning. This is (25:45) on for Doug. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning. Unknown Speaker : Earlier you mentioned \u2013 good morning. Earlier you mentioned still strong export into Latin America and I'm guessing that's probably due to still load utilization in the region. I'm just wondering if that's a sustainable trend or if you see that improving at any point this year? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. So I think some of it is certainly related to refinery utilization in the region. And as mechanical availability has fallen off, it's opened the door for us to supply the market. But going forward in addition to that, we also see that there's some good demand growth trends that we're starting to see, particularly in Brazil, which had had negative demand growth. It looks like it's turned positive. So I think even as refinery utilization improves, you'll see demand growth in the region, which should allow us to continue to see that as a good export market. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Second question just on the cash returns to shareholders. They came in above guidance in this quarter, when guidance is, obviously, 75% of net income. Just wondering what the fee considerations were in this quarter in regards to the buyback level. Was it cash flow, balance sheet cash, operating outlook? Any color would be appreciated and I'll leave it there. Thanks. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, yeah. You're exactly right. When we look at what our payout is going to be for the quarter, we do look at our expected discretionary cash flow that's going to be generated that particular quarter. We also look at our excess cash balance that we may have in determining what we want to pay out for that particular quarter. So for this quarter we paid out a little over 200% of net income, but when you look at our cash flow, excluding the working capital benefit, it's about 75% of our cash flow. And that's how we'll look at it going forward. Unknown Speaker : Got you. Thanks so much for the color, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse : Yeah, just wanted to return to two conversations. One is the $1.1 billion of growth capital. I appreciate you don't want to talk about specifics, but do you think the top of the funnel of the opportunity set for that $1.1 billion is getting larger as the U.S. producers get back to work? Trying to think about how many years you have of projects identified to drive that self-help component of total shareholder return? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: So, Ed, this is Lane. So, when you think about our capital budget, our talking numbers is we normally spend about $2.5 billion on CapEx a year. $1.5 billion of which is turnarounds and sustaining capital. It's really about $1 billion. So you can think about, I would say, a long-term run rate of $1 billion. And that's kind what we think that we naturally with our assets can manage well. And do sort of with our strategic outlook. We absolutely believe and already \u2013 I would say most particularly Rich's stuff is largely in the area of expanding logistics connectivity or refining operation and trying to run the sort of oil shale play. To the extent it would get bigger, we would certainly have a conversation and talk about whether we see a larger opportunity in that. But really our message is about $1 billion a year we're going to try to manage the business around. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse : Okay. And then I don't want to waste too many on policy, but I guess I should ask if we're going to have corporate tax plan coming out tomorrow. Not so much on corporate taxation, but on BAT, whether you've heard whether the oil industry would be exempt or what the latest is. What you're hearing on the BAT, border adjustment tax. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, hang on a second, Ed. Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: Sorry. Ed, this is Jason again. Yeah, we think the likelihood of the BAT being included in tax reforms declined substantially. It's definitely one of the more controversial aspects of tax reform. And with the difficulties the Republicans had with healthcare, we don't see them wanting to take on another fight or create another fight within the party, and the BAT clearly splits the business community. You have people for it and against it. So, for that reason, we think that's probably one of the first things they'll move away from as they try to move forward and get a win on tax reform. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse : Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, everyone. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Brad. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, Joe. Gary, I was wondering if we could follow up a little bit on the earlier OPEC conversation. I was wondering specifically about some of the Latin American heavy grades, if you've seen any sort of decline in availability? I know in the first quarter there were concerns about Maya availability. Has that continued, and maybe have you seen Venezuela volumes declining? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, so what we've seen, I guess, overall is, it does look like Venezuela's production has fallen off some. But their internal consumption for their refineries has kind of fallen off almost at a commensurate amount, so exports from Venezuela have been fairly constant actually. And then, we're seeing actually a growth in Brazilian production. So we're seeing more Brazilian barrels on the market. And then on the Maya question, we've continued to receive our contract volumes from Mexico fairly consistently. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Got it. And then maybe sticking with you, Gary, or maybe Lashway, on the Diamond Pipeline, obviously, we know the cost of the project. But I was wondering if you could give any color as to how it's expected to affect the laid-in crude cost at Memphis or any sort of EBITDA contribution for VLO that you can provide? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, so the way we view it, I mean, without giving too much specifics, today we're at a U.S. Gulf Coast plus Capline tariff to get a laid-in cost for Memphis' crude. And we believe that, with the Diamond Pipeline, we'll be at a U.S. Gulf Coast minus. And so it will be a significant change for the Memphis refinery. It's kind of hard to give EBITDA estimates, because you're kind of doing a market read in order to be able get that. But we believe it will have a significant impact on Memphis. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, understood. Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Sorry, good morning. Had the mute on there. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, guys. I guess, maybe going back to some of the questions earlier on the light heavy diff and where the narrowness of the differential incentivized going back to a light barrel. Thinking a little more forward, and using maybe a consensus expectation for light production in the U.S., Gary, where do you see your ability to run light barrels, if the differentials are favorable? Is that a 100,000, a 300,000, or potentially much higher than that, if the differentials are favorable kind of number? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, so we believe our capacity to process the light sweet crude is about 1.4 million barrels a day. So, if you look at our Investor Relations presentation, there's a pretty good slide there showing our ability to swing between grades. But overall, our total processing capacity is about 1.4 million barrels a day of light sweet capacity in the system. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And over the past year, you've run closer to which level? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, I'm not sure on the volume. Do you know, Lane? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I think we've been more like 1.1 million or 1 million barrels per day. If you look at our history \u2013 historically, where we were, that was probably about the case. Since the last time we had really compelling economics to run light crude, we finished both of these topper projects at Houston and Corpus. So we are in a position to run more even than we did last time, so. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And would we need to see substantially wider light differentials? And I'm kind of thinking LLS against Brent right now. Is that the right marker, or should we think more of a \u2013 it's an Eagle Ford or a Midland barrel at the Gulf Coast? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, so, you know the rule of thumb we always use is that the medium sours need to be discounted by 5% to your light sweet alternative. So, that's not 5% discounted to Brent. That would be a 5% discounted to whatever you're paying for Eagle Ford, and that's why last week, with where the medium sours were priced in the Gulf, our light sweet alternative favored going ahead and running light sweet. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great, thanks. And then my last question, just an accounting question. With the breakout of VLP, we saw a change in year-over-year refining margins. I think it's fairly straightforward, but we also saw a decline in reported OpEx of about $0.10. And I was wondering, is that tied to VLP, or is that something else that's going on? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: No, that is tied to VLP. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, great. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Roger. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Good morning, all. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Can I first ask just a relatively short-term question, which is just about your crude imports and how those are shifting, with seemingly not much impact from OPEC cuts. I just wondered if you could confirm that. Anything that you could add on Venezuela and Mexico would be interesting, would be part one. And then, to help you \u2013 give you some time to think, Joe, there was a mention there of a long-term bullish view on octane. I was just wondering how else you're thinking long-term about strategy? There's kind of a peak oil demand argument that's very widespread right now. Could you address really what you think the long-term challenges and opportunities are for Valero, in terms of how the market's shifting? Thanks. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: I guess I'll start with the crude question. Really, the imports we're getting from Venezuela and from Mexico have been fairly flat. We're not seeing much of a change there. The big change really, on the medium sours we've shifted a little bit. We've seen more of an impact from both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on the medium sour barrels we import from there, and we backfill those with some additional South American grades and Canadian grades. And then recently, over the last few weeks, we have actually started at one of our refineries to maximize some light sweet and replace some of the medium sour we're importing there. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: So, Paul, on the strategy and I mentioned it earlier. I think the things that we're doing today and they're very much focused on making us the best refining and marketing operation out there, and I believe that, based on the independent surveys that we really are the best, but we continue to raise the bar for ourselves and try to drive it forward. Again, that's not a short-term activity. That is a long-term activity that we'll continue to do going forward. Now, if you think long-term about the markets, okay, and the demand for our products more specifically, you say, well is U.S. demand going to continue to grow going forward? I think our forecast would be that in the next five to ten years you might see a slight decline in gasoline demand in the U.S. Diesel will be determined by economic activity, and so we'll just see how that goes. But as Gary mentioned earlier, we are seeing decent diesel demand, and a lot of that is being driven by the increase in activity that we've got in the E&P side of the business. If you think longer term and you think about where demand is going to grow, everything we read is that, globally, you're going to have increased demand for all of our products. And so our focus will go beyond the U.S. borders and we'll take a look at opportunities to increase our market presence in different international markets, and one of the things that Rich and his team are focused on are establishing a footprint in some of those markets so that we have better access to them on a rateable basis. So, I don't think you should expect us to shift the strategy materially going forward. Clearly, midstream growth is something we're focused on. Continuing to improve our refining and our renewables operation is something we're focused on. And then we've talked in the past about the possibility to take some of the streams that we're producing today and high grade them by legging into the petrochemical business. That's something that's probably a little bit longer term, but it is something that we're actively looking at these days and trying to figure out what is a way for us to enter that type of business, boiling the frog rather than diving in head first and see if we can create another earnings stream for the company. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood, Joe. I mean, one of the obvious responses to potential threats is ongoing operational improvements that you've talked about. How much more do you think you can do in terms of the utilization which we've seen steadily rising for you guys? And the operational costs, how much further do you think you can drive those down? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Paul, I'll let Lane talk about that a little bit. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: As Joe alluded to, I mean, using common metrics, we're sort of in our own space with respect to availability, but we continue to try to get better because when we look at our entire portfolio, not all of our assets are first quartile mechanical availability, whereas many of them are. So we can always work on the ones that aren't. And we have great programs to get us in that area. In terms of costs, the real cost focus is what was talked about earlier, that's in our effort to reduce secondary costs. And Gary talked about it. It's through commercial efforts to negotiate and use our size to negotiate better and then let Rich figure out places where we can build assets that will directly allow us to essentially charge ourselves the cost of that and ultimately move those into droppable assets into the MLP. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you very much, everyone. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Guys, good morning. Long time no see. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: How are you doing, Blake? Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Good. Question for you, I think probably for Mike on the tax rate. It just seems like the past few quarters have continuously come in below expectations. I know you gave a guidance for 1Q, but I'm just trying to get a sense of maybe, I guess, the Quebec piece of it probably feels more sustainable. So any thoughts around that continuing to trend lower than what we've seen historically? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I guess I would \u2013 how I would characterize that is we do have a few audits that are underway and that we don't know the exact timing on when those will be settled. So, here, this past quarter we did settle a couple of our state audits favorably which resulted in a reversal of some reserves, which then lowered the tax rate. So I think our 30% number is a good number. Unless we have some of these other events occur that allows us to lower the rate. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Okay. Fair enough. The second question is on the CapEx budget. I know you kind of tackled the growth piece of it, but mine is on the sustaining capital part. $1.6 billion. I know that includes some tier compliance and I guess I'm just wondering, as you kind of get through that this year, is there an opportunity for that to move lower into the future? Or should we just be thinking of always kind of some type of compliance that's going to land in there, so it's really the $1.6 billion is probably a good number go-forward? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Blake, this is Lane. I'll answer this in a couple of ways. One is I would say we believe and the guidance we've given is more of about $1.5 billion, of which I would say $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion is like truly sustaining capital. Somewhere around $200 million to $300 million is what we think normally is sort of regulatory spend that is not \u2013 we sort of put into the sustaining capital but it's not like we're \u2013 we're not rebuilding our assets or maintaining them, it's something that we're having to do due to regulatory things. We're a little bit higher this time due largely to Tier 3. Our Tier 3 spend is about $500 million, of which much of it will \u2013 we'll continue to spend up until the time that we have to be in compliance which is January 1st of 2020. And the bulk of it \u2013 really the bulk of that spend will be in 20018 and 2019. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Maybe you've touched on this a couple of times, maybe one follow up on midstream growth opportunities. Can you characterize a little bit the environment for, I guess, for growth opportunities and returns that you're seeing on that side of the business? I mean, I think we've seen \u2013 we continue to see midstream operators take skinnier economics in order to compete in some regions. And those are certainly in areas that have (43:55) kind of crude transport in some of the more popular growth basins, which I think you guys have generally avoided up to this point. But, as you think about your opportunities to deploy incremental capital, are you seeing downward pressure on returns in those types of businesses? Any thoughts on dynamics in that part of the business would be great. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Ryan, let me just try to be sure we're clear. So, there's two things we're looking at, right? One, are the organic growth projects that we're doing. I would say that we're not reducing our return thresholds on our organic growth projects in the midstream part of the business, and we kind of target, whether it be a drop or whether it be an organic growth project, we want to be like a 12% pre-tax IRR regardless, okay? Now if you're thinking in terms of M&A and the valuations that we're seeing on midstream assets, I'd say that they're pretty doggone aggressive, okay? Rich, you want to - Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, no, the bid asking is very wide and it depends on how aggressive people want to be on this. I mean, we're always interested in looking at these opportunities, given that they be strategic for Valero. But today we would say, it's like Joe said, it's very aggressive right now out there. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I mean, you saw -- Ryan, you saw the recent deal that was done around Navigator. And I don't know what the rate of return might be on that, but it was a very aggressive bid, it seemed. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, I guess we should expect you guys to be more focused on organic opportunities than inorganic, is that safe to say, at least in the near term? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: No, I wouldn't say that. We're going to continue to do what we've done and Mike runs the M&A group here. I mean, we're going to look at everything that's out there and try to make a determination. In a perfect world, we'd find a bunch of assets where we can earn the types of returns who want to do the deal in VLP and it would provide some kind of strategic synergy for Valero Energy also. And we evaluate it looking at it both ways. We have probably liberalized our strategy around VLP a little bit. Historically, I've said that we look at the projects from Valero Energy's perspective first and then decide if we can or can't do it at VLP. And I would tell you that still is the primary motivation, but we are looking at transactions now that would be somewhat more third-party that the user of the asset would be a third-party, but it would bring value to Valero in some way. So, we're adjusting our perspective as we go. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great, thanks. That's very helpful. And then maybe one more on payout, and I realize that you've already touched on this a few times, and it seems to come out every quarter, but how do you think about your willingness to expand the balance sheet to returning cash to shareholders not just on a quarterly basis because I realize there's volatility around that, and fourth and first quarters tend to be particularly weak, but your willingness to expand the balance sheet, outspend cash flow to buy back stock on an annual basis over the course of the year? Is that something you're willing to do on a more sustainable basis and at what point is leverage a limiting factor? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, I don't think we would be \u2013 we wouldn't lever up a material amount to increase our share \u2013 or we wouldn't lever up at all to increase our share buybacks. What we do look at, like I said, as we look at our discretionary cash flow that we expect to earn for the next quarter and the next couple of quarters, we balance that with our capital requirements that we have, and the other things that we have in place that we have to cover, debt service, whatever it is. So we are forward looking in that. Our plan is not to hoard cash, however. And our plan is to remain competitive with our peers and payout, but we would not lever up our balance sheet to return cash to shareholders. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Fernando Valle with Citi. Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi guys, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning. Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: My question is back on the organic expansion, and if you would consider growing in wholesale in Mexico following the liberalization in the market? And there's been a strong pull of gasoline of late. Is that an area where you'd consider growing the wholesale business? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes. Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Is it a place \u2013 given the succinct answer, is it a place where you're currently exploring opportunities for growth? Have you made any advancements already, or still very early? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, okay. I told Rich I didn't want him revealing secrets, right? But, no, obviously we're looking at it. I mean, we sell \u2013 Gary, you sell a lot of barrels into Mexico today, okay? And I think everybody out there is going to be looking at Mexico as a growth opportunity. And it's certainly one that is very logical for us to pursue. And so, I think you should assume that it's something that we plan to be involved in. And not only Mexico, but other Latin American countries also. Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Fair enough. Great, thanks, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Margolin with Cowen and Company. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. How's it's going? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Sam. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: So, my first question is about crude exports from the U.S. They've been rising really rapidly, and it's a little bit surprising that you would think, as exports grow, the exporter would have to give up price, but you don't really see it reflected in the markers that we have access to, at least, in the Gulf. And so maybe these exporters have other commercial things underneath the marker? But just generally, how do you see this playing out? Most people believe that exports need to keep rising. Is it eventually going to be reflected in the prices that are offered broadly to domestic refiners, or is it going to be something where the point of these exports is to keep those markers stable, and basically domestic refiners wouldn't get the same advantage? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Sam, this is Gary. I think you're going to continue to see volatility in the markets. And so we see that the domestic markers get a little strong and then weaken again, and you see imports come and then you see exports rise again. We've been very active exporting to our refiners in our system. We've been exporting to Quebec for quite a while now, and in the first quarter, we exported volume to Pembroke, and ran our first Permian Basin barrels in the Pembroke refinery, and saw good economic advantage to do that. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, this is sort of a follow up on Ryan's question about the capital structure. Valero is making a lot of investments to address third party costs and increase reliability and flexibility. The effect is kind of to bring the range of earnings through the cycle higher, on sort of a continuous basis. So, just to piggyback on kind of what Ryan was asking in a different way, does that allow the company to sort of support a little bit higher leverage? The industry exited a period of deleveraging recently, and I wonder if some of these investments that bring long-term advantages could lead to debt maturing, or reversing even? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Sam, I'll let Mike speak to the levels of leverage, okay? But I mean very clearly what we're trying to do is create higher lows and higher highs in our EPS. And we really like to distinguish ourselves as a company that is able to produce earnings in challenging margin environments. And I think we've demonstrated that over the last several quarters. So, the kind of the self-help focus is something that we're just going to maintain as part of what we do going forward. Whether it allows us to achieve higher levels of leverage. I mean, Mike? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, I guess theoretically, you could say that would be the case. However, we have provided a debt to cap range of 20% to 30% that we're comfortable with. Maintaining our investment grade credit rating is very important to the company, and a debt level within that range, we think, we do that. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks so much. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You bet. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Back on your feedstocks. Can you talk about, how does running more light crude in your system impact yields, capture rates, or anything else from a process standpoint? And specifically, are you seeing any issues with the reported high API gravities of the incremental barrels coming out of the Delaware Basin? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey, Chi, it's Lane. So it just really depends... Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi Lane. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: ...certainly, in our Mid-Continent refineries, there's times that we can be \u2013 the lighter part of our refineries get constrained by these higher APIs. And then there's times where the gravity comes back in line, and we're off (53:37). And we have a longer term view that these crudes are getting lighter. We look at the same data, I'm sure, that you are, so we hit those constraints. (53:46) Now, with that said, we don't hit those constraints quite as much in our Gulf Coast refineries, because we have a little more flexibility in finding other feedstocks and crudes to blend with these things to make sure that we're always up against that constraint. So it's a little easier to optimize around these lighter crudes than it is in the Mid-Continent. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. I guess, in looking at the Gulf Coast results, your index, the Valero index for the region was up, I think, $2.35 a barrel year-over-year versus 1Q last year. But the realized margin in the quarter was up only $0.35. Was that short fall in capture mainly due to the planned maintenance, or is there something else going on there? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Chi, this is Gary. I would tell you the biggest impact we had was really on the heavy feedstocks we bring into the system compared to the Maya marker that moved quite a bit, so our heavy feedstocks were more expensive relative to Maya marker. And some of that was just Maya was much more competitive in the first quarter than what we either saw in the first quarter, what we had year-over-year. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Gary, but I think you said that you're not having problems on Maya delivery, but that the pricing has tightened up. Is that fair... Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Well \u2013 yeah, the Maya pricing and deliveries were fine, but the other heavy sours that we're buying versus the Maya pricing was not as competitive in the first quarter as what we've seen previously. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Is that trend \u2013 do you think that will continue? We saw that Pemex has tighten up the K factor on Maya for May, so...? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, we see that come and go. There's times where Mexican crude is very competitive and times where they kind of fall where they're not. So, that's why we kind of have a diversified strategy on pulling the South American grades and Canadian grades. And it looks like it has come in some already. And I would expect that to come in and continue to come in. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great, thanks for your comments. Operator : And thank you. We now have a follow up question from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey guys. Any kind of a rough estimate in terms of the opportunity cost loss in the first quarter due to the planned and unplanned outages? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey, Paul, this is Lane. So, our planned outages in the first quarter was \u2013 the opportunity cost was $231 million. So as you've heard us talk, we've had \u2013 it was a fairly heavy turnaround quarter. In terms, of unplanned outages it was about $40 million. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And this is not just an expense, but also you're including the loss profit that the way how you guys calculate, right? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Loss profit and expense? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes, it includes expense. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to John Locke for closing remarks. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Thanks everybody for joining the call today. Please contact me or the IR team if you have any additional questions. Thank you. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Welcome to the Valero Energy Corporation Reports 2017 second quarter earnings results conference call. My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke, Vice President, Investor Relations. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that we completed another quarter where we ran our refineries very well at high rates, and also delivered good financial results. Our low cash operating cost and highly reliable operations, combined with our advantage footprint focused on the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Mid-Continent, enabled us to achieve positive earnings and free cash flow generation, despite the choppy margin environment. As always, our team's primary focus is on safety and reliability, and we continue to deliver distinctive operating performance, but remain committed to improvement. As such, we're extending our participation in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program to more of our facilities. Moving on to the refined products markets, we're pleased to see a rebound in distillate demand, in addition to the strong gasoline pull by domestic and export customers. Downward trends and product inventories and structural shortages in the primary export markets for the U.S. Gulf Coast provide an encouraging backdrop as we move into the second half of the year. On the crude supply side, we're seeing the impact of the OPEC cuts on the medium and heavy sour discounts, but increased U.S. drilling activity and crude production have supported attractive domestic sweet crude discounts relative to Brent in the second quarter. As a result, we switched our refining system to a maximum light crude slate in June. With current market conditions, operating a system with flexibility to process a broad range of feedstocks is very beneficial. Turning to capital allocation, we continued to execute very well on our capital program during the quarter. The Diamond Pipeline and Wilmington cogeneration plant are both on track for completion this year. Construction is continuing as planned on the Diamond Green Diesel expansion and the Houston alkylation unit, and we're looking forward to seeing the additional earnings contribution from all of these projects once they're complete. We continued demonstrating our commitment to stockholders by returning $658 million through dividends and stock buybacks in the second quarter. At this pace, we believe we're well positioned to exceed our payout target for the year. Lastly, on the topic of public policy, we get a lot of questions seeking our perspective on the many initiatives being worked on by the Trump administration. While it's difficult for us to speculate on the range or probability of potential outcomes, we're pleased with the emphasis that President Trump and his administration have placed on the energy sector, and their willingness to discuss the issues. So, with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you, Joe. For the second quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $548 million, or $1.23 per share, compared to $814 million or $1.73 per share, in the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $503 million, or $1.07 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany our release. Operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of 2017 was $959 million, compared to $1.3 billion for the second quarter of 2016, which has been revised, retrospectively, to reflect the VLP segment. Second quarter 2017 operating income was in line with second quarter 2016 adjusted operating income of $902 million. Refining throughput volumes averaged 3 million barrels per day, which was 192,000 barrels per day higher than the second quarter of 2016. Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the second quarter of 2017, despite an external power failure at the Benicia Refinery that caused an abrupt shut down and unplanned maintenance. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.51 per barrel were $0.10 per barrel higher than the second quarter of 2016, mainly due to higher energy costs in the second quarter of 2017. The ethanol segment generated $31 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $69 million in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2016 was $49 million. The decrease from the 2016 adjusted amount was primarily due to higher energy costs and strong industry ethanol production. Operating income for the VLP segment in the second quarter of 2017 was $71 million compared to $52 million in the second quarter of 2016, mainly due to contributions from the Meraux and Three Rivers terminals, and the Red River pipeline, which were acquired subsequent to the second quarter of last year. For the second quarter of 2017, G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $178 million, and net interest expense was $119 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $499 million, and the effective tax rate was 26% in the second quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate was lower than expected mainly due to the favorable resolution of an income tax audit. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $8.5 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.2 billion, of which $88 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 24%. At the end of June, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which, $720 million was available only for VLP. We generated $1.8 billion of cash from operating activities in the second quarter. Excluding a working capital benefit of about $700 million, net cash generated was $1.1 billion. With regard to investing activities, we made $461 million of growth and sustaining capital investments, of which, $63 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. Moving to financing activities, we returned $658 million in cash to our stockholders in the second quarter, which included $312 million in dividend payments, and $346 million for the purchase of 5.4 million shares of Valero common stock. As of June 30, we had approximately $1.9 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Capital investments for 2017 remain on track for $2.7 billion of total spend. This amount, which includes turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments, consists of approximately $1.6 billion for sustaining and $1.1 billion for growth. For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.65 million barrel per day to 1.7 million barrels per day, U.S. Mid-Continent at 445,000 barrels per day to 465,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 280,000 barrels per day to 300,000 barrels per day, and North Atlantic at 440,000 barrels per day to 460,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $3.80 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, for the third quarter to be around $190 million, and net interest expense should be around $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $500 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This helps us ensure all callers have time to ask their questions. If you have more than two, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Operator : And thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Phil Gresh, with JPMorgan. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning, Phil. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question, just on the quarter itself, in terms of the situation at Benicia. I know there's been some press about this. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on it a little bit. What would you quantify as lost opportunity cost from it? It sounds like you're back, up and running, but just if you could clarify that as well. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Phil, this is Mike. We did \u2013 yeah, we are back, up and running. The opportunity is about \u2013 it's over $100 million in this loss. Using $100 million can give you some perspective; that would equate to about $0.16 per share. So, our second quarter earnings should have been around in that $1.40 range. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And we're back up and running at this point? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes, we are. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes, we are. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it, okay. Okay, second question is just on the capital spending. It feels a lot like last year, where you're trending well below the $2.7 billion number and kind of run rating closer to about $2.2 billion. So, is there anything big, specifically in the second half, we should be thinking about from a turnaround standpoint, growth capital standpoint, that would lead to a big pickup? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: I mean, our guidance right now is still $2.7 billion. We are trending a little bit below that. We have the completion out of the few of the projects that Joe talked about in his comments. So, we'll be reviewing this as we go throughout the balance of the year, and see if we need to give any updated guidance. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Phil. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Cheng, with Barclays. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Two questions that maybe I don't know whether it's Gary or whether Lane is here. In your refining system, you've been doing phenomenally well for the last several years. Utilization rate is up, and more reliable. So, why not that realistically should we assume that this is as good on a sustainable run rate that you may be able to achieve or you actually think that the sky is the limit, and you will continue to be able to push it upward? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Paul, this is Lane. I'll take a stab at it. We obviously, always focus on reliability. Even though we know we outperform our peer group in this space, there's always room for improvement. We have a whole portfolio of 14 refineries. Some are absolutely excellent in the area of reliability and some not so much. And so, we can continue to work on those and get better. But, that's really what we're focused on is trying to be reliable. And through reliability, we think it's the path to lower operating costs, because we minimize the one-time event. So, there's still upside with respect to our reliability over the long haul. I mean, I think the area that we continue to really focus on is improving our turnaround duration. That's really the sort of the last \u2013 our cost structure is great. We just want to get \u2013 that's the area that we think we can work on. So, essentially, try to do these \u2013 expanded to raise the interval between turnarounds and execute on time and certainly be a very predictable on that. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And if you could quantify, say is it going to be another 1%, 2%? Any kind of range that you can help? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: I'd have to get back with you on that, Paul. I don't know that we can \u2013 I don't know that we have estimated a range for that. The measure we use internally for our reliability is a Solomon indicator for mechanical availability, and I would say it's probably on the order of 0.5% to 1% probably improvement is still in front of us. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. The second question is for Joe. Joe, it's a little bit of the curveball. The last month or so, we have heard the number of countries in Europe, such as in UK and France, talking about, by 2040, they would stop the sale or ban the sale of the gasoline and diesel car. Just curious that in the board that when you guys are looking at that, is that a threat the board actually spend a lot of time at all? Or that you think say another 20 years to 30 years out is just way too premature to really thinking too much on that? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Paul, last year, at our strategic planning session, we met with the board and talked about the long-term viability of fossil fuels. So, the products that we produce. And every analyst that we read believes that, and people are doing 20-year outlooks, they all stated that we were going to see continued demand for gasoline and diesel fuel into the extended future. This news, I believe that you're talking about, I guess, we saw it a couple of days ago, yesterday or day before, on the EU moving away from fossil fuel vehicles by 2040. And it's not a surprise that things like that get proposed. But it's so far out on the horizon and so many things change that it's not something that we would change our strategy today to try to deal with. Jason, is there anything that you'd add to that? Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: I'd just add \u2013 kind of echo what you said. Specific to the UK announcement, it seems like they're really focusing on improving their air quality, specifically fighting nitrogen dioxide emissions. And 2040 is a way out. I mean, it's hard to say what pollution control or other technologies could evolve during that time, which may lead to different policy actually being implemented by the time you get to 2040. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: So, Paul, just to summarize, I think it's not an issue that we believe is material enough right now that it's something that we need to alter strategy or visit with the board extensively about. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Spiro Dounis, with UBS. Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to start off with Mexico. I believe, we've seen some headlines suggesting that maybe they already made or are in the process of getting permits there, expanding into Mexico and the wholesale market. Just wondering if you could provide anything on that front. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I can, this is Gary. We are looking to build upon our current supply relationship with Mexico, as opportunities for product demand growth appear to be there. We believe our refineries are well positioned to allow us to be the cost advantage supplier into Mexico. We are in the final stages of securing a major supply arrangement in Mexico, but we have certain confidentiality obligations that prohibit us really from talking about it at this time. We're working on some pretty exciting things, and we'll be able to share our Mexico strategy with you in the near future. Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC : Totally understand. I appreciate that color. And second, Joe, you mentioned the RFS, and the fact that you're encouraged just purely by the fact that the administration is willing to listen. I guess, I'm just wondering for sort of gauging our optimism on some sort of relief, is that really the only thing to be excited about, is that they're actually listening? Or do you feel like real relief is something we should expect maybe November or sometime next year? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Boy, that's really a great question. Why not let Jason take a crack at this, and then we'll see if there's anything to add. Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: Sure, yeah, this is Jason again. One thing that happened recently were the proposed RBOs were released by the EPA, and they were generally what we were expecting. We're pleased to see the reductions in the cellulosic and advanced targets, which seem to be more in line with the volumes that are actually being produced. Regarding the RIN prices, the RBO really didn't change our outlook for what we foresee on the horizon. On the volume side, we still have a 15 billion gallon conventional ethanol target, which has the industry butting up against the blend wall. And the blend wall is a real challenge in light of vehicle warranty, equipment compatibility and other issues. One positive note was, EPA did mention in the proposed RBO that they would be looking at possibly using their reset in the future, which is encouraging. That's a tool they have at their disposal. We also still have this broken structure with a disconnect between the point of obligation and the point of compliance. There're still very long parties and very short parties, and we think this is contributing to the high RIN prices, which are costing consumers billions of dollars a year. We are still hopeful the EPA is going to address the point of obligation. Our petition is still outstanding and the docket is still open. And these high RIN prices really aren't benefiting corn farmers or ethanol producers. It's just the RIN-long parties. They're not leading to more ethanol blending because the parties who control the blending are benefiting from the high RIN prices. So they just have no incentive to push to the blend wall. So, we're hoping this is a situation we can get addressed. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: We have been continuing to work this very actively, and really the administration has been very receptive to conversations around this. They are trying to do what's right and to fix broken processes. And so, we remain hopeful that point of obligation is dealt with properly, and we also are hopeful that the EPA uses its authority to adjust the RBOs to be sure that the blend wall doesn't become a chronic problem going forward. Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Really appreciate the comprehensive answer. Thanks, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Heffern, with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, everyone. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning, Brad. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Morning, Joe. You or Gary, I'm just wondering your thoughts on if we see sanctions on Venezuela, what the impact on Valero's crude sourcing could be. Do you think that there will be difficulty securing heavy volumes? Or is it only going to be a price effect, if there is a price effect? Any color there would be great. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Brad, this is Gary. We've had a longstanding, very good relationship with PDVSA and they've been a good crude supplier to our system. The way we view any potential sanctions is, it really just creates some inefficiencies in the crude market. So, the natural trade flow for a lot of Venezuelan production should be to the U.S. Gulf Coast. If sanctions were imposed, those barrels will continue to flow. They'll just flow to other markets, and then we'll have to buy barrels away from other markets to supply our system, which will cause the cost of the heavy crude to go up some. It's really impossible for me to speculate how much the cost impact that would be. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Joe, I feel like we kind of have this conversation every quarter. But you guys continue to come in far above the payout target, and I think that you've come in above it ever since you've had the payout target. So, is that just an artifact of being in a lower crude spread environment right now that the earnings are depressed, but the cash flows aren't? Or is there a time in the future when we could see that target move higher? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, I mean, that's a good question, too. We are producing significant amounts of free cash flow, and we've been consistent in using the capital allocation framework that we've got in place to help guide our use of cash. The one thing that we've shared is that we don't have an intention to continue to build huge stockpiles of cash, because Mike's got the balance sheet in a place where with our low debt to cap, if we wanted to do something we could do it. So, I think you should anticipate that we're going to continue to execute similarly to what we've done in the last several quarters. We always evaluate share repurchase versus dividends, and we would like to be in a position to continue to increase the dividend going forward. But to the extent that we have free cash, we're going to use it. Mike, anything you'd add to that? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: In addition to the payout target, we do look at, I mean, obviously, our operating and financial results, our cash flow, our cash position, and then competing uses of that cash. So, the target is just one thing that we look at. And Joe said, our plan is not to hoard the cash, but we're going to continue to invest in our business, and then also buy back shares, if that's the best alternative. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Appreciate the answers, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Brad. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Sankey, with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, good morning, everyone. This is kind of maybe not a follow-up, but maybe should have been a prequel to the previous question, Joe, which is about where you think we are in the cycle. Because, the way I see it, oil has settled around $50 per barrel, and looks like that kind of down the strip. Your earnings have been fairly stable. We've mentioned that you've been doing a great job of paying out cash. I guess one exception might be the OPEC cuts and whether that changes things. And the other thing I wanted to sort of address, and this is a bit convoluted, but also how you see seasonality now. And then, to be specific, to start you off, you said you maximized out your light crude consumption. Could you just specify or remind us what that number is? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You bet, Paul, and I'll let Gary take a crack at this. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay, to start with, on the light processing capability, we now say we can run about 1.6 million barrels a day of light sweet crude. In the second quarter, we were a little below 1.4 million barrels a day, so about 88% of our capacity was utilized in the second quarter. The third quarter, we'll see that trend up a little bit more. Some of it has been, some of the domestic medium sours have still been economic to run, and that's why we're not completely at 100% of our capacity in the system. On the discussions on margins, we tend to look at a mid-cycle case. And our view is that where current margins are, they're below mid-cycle. The gasoline cracks are good, slightly above mid-cycle. But the diesel cracks have been fairly significantly below our mid-cycle case. As we move forward, our view is that the diesel cracks continue to improve, as global demand growth causes those balances to tighten. And then, certainly, when you look out further, the IMO bunker spec change, in our mind, has a significant impact on diesel consumption and will cause cracks to be fairly strong as you approach 2020. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, how do you define mid-cycle then? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: So, everyone does that differently. We have a period that is from 2009 through 2015 that we use. That average over that period is what we call our mid-cycle. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, that's understood. And so, I guess you're a bit below. Would you be anticipating, therefore, higher oil prices? I mean, crude prices going forward. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes, we think crude prices will go up. I think that the efficiency gains in the upstream kind of caps how high they need to go, but we certainly see where crude prices will go up some from where they are today. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks. And, Joe, if I could \u2013 again, speaking of people saying we seem to ask this every quarter, but if I could just roll back, you seem to be talking about cash in and cash out is how you're looking at the company. But you've got this net income target. Could you just square the circle one more time for me on the payout potentially of net income against the company, which seems to be more planned on cash in, cash out? Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Paul, I think we said, we look at both, right? We use the 75% of net income as the target, just because it's such a transparent metric. But when Mike and John are looking at our repurchase strategy, and really the use of cash in general, in setting that target, he looks at multiple metrics, right. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: I mean, if you look at it on a cash flow basis, excluding the favorable working capital that we had this quarter, the payout is at 60% of our cash flow. That was for the second quarter. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, it's been great for you guys. I mean, if you look at the multiple, assuming that you're below mid-cycle it makes sense, but you've nevertheless seen quite a material expansion in your multiple, I think, as a result of your strategies. So, congrats, I guess. Thanks, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : And our next question comes from Neil Mehta, with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Neil. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, you guys have a unique perspective on what's happening from a global oil demand perspective given how far your barrels travel. Obviously, there was concerns about demand earlier this year, with the IEA reporting demand sub 1 million barrels a day in the first quarter. Second quarter looked very, very good. I just wanted to get your perspective, over the last couple months and then also looking forward, where do you see oil demand tracking? And, geographically, where do you see pockets of strength? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Neil, this is Gary. We continue to see domestic demand as strong, and then a real pull into the export markets. As the U.S. Gulf Coast basis is stronger during driving season, you don't see that so much on gasoline. Although, we still saw a pretty good pull of gasoline into Mexico and South America. Then, on the diesel side, we saw very high diesel demand into the export markets. We exported 281,000 barrels a day of diesel during the quarter, which was a record for us, and we're really not seeing that fall off much as you move forward. So, this time of year is typically where diesel demand bottoms out, seasonally, and so the fact that we've been able to continue to pull diesel inventories down, at a period where demand is at its lowest, kind of sets up what could be a very good heating oil season this year. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's great, guys. Then, the follow-up question is just on RINs here. I think your guidance is $750 million to $850 million. Given where the D6 RIN has moved, and even frankly, the D4 as well, is it fair to say that you're going to be on the upper end of that range? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I think that's fair to say, Neil. Unfortunately. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Yeah. All right, guys, thanks. Thanks again. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You bet. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Neil. Operator : And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Hey, guys, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : I realize we didn't get tax guidance for next quarter, but I was hoping you could maybe just give us an update on the status of this income tax audit. I guess I'm just a little worried if this finally rolls off or comes off, we're going to have like a rapid reversal in the taxable income. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, the tax rate, we've had some favorable adjustments the last couple of quarters that has lowered that tax rate. But, why don't I try to give you guidance for the year. So, for 2017, we do expect our effective tax rate to be about 28%. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Okay, so, on a full year, 28%. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, let's try that. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : That works. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Blake, you were listening, you missed the tax guidance. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: We had a bet on that, whether anybody would notice. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : I thought maybe John just skipped it, so. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: But we've been so accurate. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : The second question I had for you is kind of a follow-on to Paul's question on the light sweet. So, it sounds like you're kind of at 88% of your capacity in 2Q, and that's trending up in 3Q. I guess, is the view that that will continue ramping up as lower 48 volumes ramp up? And I presume, once we've exhausted the system, assuming Valero is kind of a proxy for the industry, presumably we'll have more exports. Are you planning to kind of participate in that? Or is that an opportunity for you? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Blake. So, I guess the way I would say, certainly in the near future, we expect to be maximizing light sweet, and it's somewhat tied to U.S. production. But, to me, the real change would probably be more tied to when the OPEC barrels come back online. As the OPEC production comes back online, the differentials widen back out and we start pushing some mediums and heavies back into our system. In terms of your question on the exports, our primary focus is putting the most economic crude dye in front of each of our refineries. So, our exports have really been focused on getting barrels to Pembroke, in Quebec. As exports continue to grow, we could decide if we want to venture into selling to third parties. But right now, our focus has just been getting it into our own system. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Got it. All right, thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Doug Leggate, with Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Morning, Joe. Morning, everybody. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Joe, I want to hit on this light crudes question as well, if I may. I hate to beat a dead horse. But I'm just kind of curious, from a macro standpoint, what has triggered this change recently. It might seem pretty obvious. But Saudis and OPEC's comments about cutting exports to the U.S., directionally, is that the thing that has prompted you to do this? I'm just curious what the catalyst was, given the OPEC theoretically cut at the beginning of the year. As a quick follow on to that, hopefully John doesn't count this as my second question, when you're running light sweet crude, what does that do to your operating costs, given you're not running the upgraders? I guess, less than you'd normally be. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: All right, I'll answer the first part, and then Lane answers the operating cost portion. Really what we saw is, when the OPEC cuts were announced, you really didn't see much of a market response to that announcement. So, the medium sour differentials and the heavy sour differentials remained wide enough that that was the economic barrel to put in front of our system. Had the cuts have gone on longer, longer, the medium sour differentials have come in and the heavy sour differentials have come in such that the most economic barrel to put in front of our refineries is the domestic light sweet. And so, that's what we've done. And the change there kind of started occurring in the second quarter. And even in the second quarter, you saw the domestic medium sour still economic. But now, if you look at the MARS versus MEH type spread, or TI in Houston; it strongly favors running domestic light sweet. And so that's where we're headed, and I think we'll be there until the OPEC production comes back. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, Doug, this is Lane. In terms of the incremental operating cost or light versus medium or heavy, I think at a reportable level, it's not very measurable. I mean, I don't think you would see a change in our operating costs, based on our crude mix. Where it would show up, if we run more or less barrels. And so, to the extent that, at some of our refineries when we go light, like at Port Arthur, we actually run more barrel, because our coker fills up later. So, on an OpEx basis, you might actually see our OpEx go down. But, it's a little bit by refinery by refinery whether it would show up. I sort of believe you wouldn't see it in aggregate. We wouldn't \u2013 it wouldn't be a reconciling item for us. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's helpful. I've actually assumed it would be an incremental positive, given your coker comment. But \u2013 so, my follow up and, John might note, sort of for the record, my second question. But my follow-up, I guess with a bigger, a larger light slate, you're going to see a larger gasoline cut coming out of that. And I want to wrap a couple things together here with the dynamics of U.S. demand. Your project queue, as it relates to somewhat limited growth capital with your discipline and so on, I'm just wondering where the whole export strategy fits for products in Valero's strategy going forward. In other words, is that something we could see you swing to a more aggressive investment to basically avoid RINs and maximize your gasoline margin and all the rest of that? I'm just kind of curious how that fits. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, so I guess the first question on whether running the lighter diet increases our gasoline make, I would say it's not significantly different as we go lighter. A lot of our gasoline production capacity is maxed out. And so when we go lighter, we end up exporting naphtha. And then, on the export strategy, we want complete flexibility to take our finished product to the highest netback market. And so that's certainly been our strategy, and we'll continue along that path. And if that's selling domestically, that's great. But if we can get a higher netback putting the barrels on the water, then we want the flexibility to be able to do that. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: And Doug, just on the capital piece of this. So, we are working projects aggressively that facilitate our ability to be very efficient in the export of products. And it's just, unfortunately, a little bit premature for us to give you any insight into that. But I think that you should expect there to be more communications on this over the next several weeks, as we firm up some of the things that we're working on. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's terrific, Joe. Maybe we can do it on beer and a sausage and you can tell me about it over that. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You're on. I would look forward to it. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks a lot. Take care. Bye. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you. Bye. Operator : And we have our next question from Chi Chow with Tudor Pickering, Holt. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you. I might have missed this, but could you provide the product export volumes by product in 2Q? And related to that, can you talk about the dynamic on the slack capacity on the Colonial Pipeline? And is that related to the exports? And how will that trend going forward in the back half of the year here? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey, Chi, this is Gary. So, on gasoline, we did 88,000 barrels a day during the second quarter. Most, all of that went to Mexico and South America. Diesel, we did 281,000 barrels a day. And then, if you combine the kerosene, it was 326,000 barrels a day. That went about 75% to South America, 25% to Europe. And so, then, on your question on Colonial, we've seen the economics of shipping on Colonial have been challenged for quite some time now, and it really is tied to the exports. So, historically, what you saw happen is, as U.S. Gulf Coast started to become long on product, the bases got weak, and you had an arb to ship up to New York Harbor on Colonial. What's happening today is that the length in the Gulf has been pulled to the export market, and it kind of keeps the U.S. Gulf Coast basis a lot stronger, such that there isn't an economic incentive to ship on Colonial. The other factor that comes into play here is the Jones Act freight. And so with Jones Act freight coming off, you can put finished product on a Jones Act vessel and bring it around to the harbor, and it's within a penny of what it costs to move it on Colonial. So, that also has been a factor that's come into Colonial coming off allocation. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Gary, I guess what you were saying back to the netback question. You are getting a higher netback on exports then is that what's implied versus shipping on Colonial? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes, that's right. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay, thanks. Second question is more a strategic in nature. Yes, Joe, regarding the company's long-term investment strategy, many of your Gulf Coast competitors and I'm pointing to specifically Exxon and Motiva, have announced absolutely huge capital programs, $18 billion to $20 billion predominantly to integrate downstream into petchems. Do these announcements influence your thinking at all, from a competitive standpoint, on the long-term strategy of sticking to refining, primarily in the Gulf Coast? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, I mean, Chi, it's a good question. And it doesn't change our strategy. We've talked in the past about a petrochemical strategy, and it's it really not as dramatic or as significant as you might be thinking. Currently, we produce a number of petrochemical streams. Products like propylene and BTX. And the strategy that we're talking about here is really to capture more of the margin available from those petrochemical stream where it makes economic sense to do so. The investments associated would be related to any additional processing, and then logistics to store and transport these products. We have no plans to deviate from our capital allocation framework, and decisions to allocate capital to these projects will be based on the expected project returns within our notional capital budget. So, although these guys are investing in these major petchem projects, that's really not our plan or our focus. And we do continue to have a focus on improving our refinery operations. We have a focus on integrating from the wellhead into the refineries, and from the refineries out, so that the margin that's captured in the movement of products and crude is something that we capture rather than paying to somebody else. And so, I don't think that you should worry that you're going to wake up one day and we're going to be announcing that we're investing in a mega billion dollar petchem complex. It's just not on the radar screen for us. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Are any of these incremental petchem projects in the CapEx budget at this point? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: They're still in development, and we've got placeholders for them. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: So, again, I don't think you should expect that we're going to deviate materially from this 2.5 to 2.7 number, going forward. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thanks, Joe. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from Justin Jenkins with Raymond James. Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess maybe a couple on midstream from me. So, obviously, there's a lot of competition there and some pretty high asset valuations. And, Joe, I know you've said in the past that recent transactions have looked a bit aggressive, and really I appreciate the answer to Blake's question on light sweet. But really would the interlink with the refining footprint in VLP and maybe the synergies there be enough to justify a higher multiple for building or buying assets? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I think if you're going to buy assets, you're going to have to be prepared to pay a higher multiple. I mean, that's just where the market seems to be today. And, so, building them has really been where we've had a great deal of focus. I mean, we're looking at assets that are in the market for sale today, but we always compare it to the alternative uses for cash. Relative to exports, Rich, you want to give any update? Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. Relative to the exports on the crude side, we're looking at a couple projects at Corpus and at Port Arthur to increase the ability to export crude. We've got, as Joe mentioned earlier, we've got some projects that are in the development that we'll be able to share more in the coming weeks, but that will significantly increase the ability to increase product exports. So, we're focused on getting that flexibility for Valero. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, but, Justin, we really like the idea of the organic growth projects, where we have a great deal of control over the investment profile and the project execution. Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, great. I appreciate that response, guys. And maybe \u2013 not sure how far I'm going to get with this one, but with the contested terminal acquisition in California, anything you can share there, in terms of what you expect, and in terms of how that plays out, and what it would mean to have in Valero's hands going forward? Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. This is Rich again. So, we really can't provide anymore additional details than what's kind of been in the press release, other than the FTC allowed the transaction to go through, and the Cal AG has intervened. And that's kind of where it's at right now. Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Figured that was the case, but had to try. Thanks, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You bet. Operator : And our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Faisel. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Just a couple questions. First of all, just on the working capital, the $700 million benefit. What caused that? Because I guess some of the companies that are reporting are seeing working capital draws. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, in our instance, a little over $400 million of that was due to reduction in inventories. And then we had about a $250 million increase in the crude expenses. So, some of that's going to be timing, obviously, where we will be paying off those expenses. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, got you. And then just on the projects that you guys have in development, but not in execution. I guess this potential, I guess, $1 billion in EBITDA, when do you have to start to go to FID on these projects? Because, you've already got some projects in execution that are in 2019, and you're talking about a potentially large number as you go into 2021. So, at what point do you have to start making decisions on some of these projects, whether it's octane enhancement or the supply chain into Mexico? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Faisel, the way, and Lane can talk in more detail about this, but the way that we work our projects, we look at the target for the year. And we've got a fairly dynamic approach to doing this, where Lane's engineering staff will work the projects, and then we review them periodically to see which ones we want to continue to proceed forward and to invest capital in. And so, it's not like we look at everything in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter. We're looking at them throughout the year. Any color you want to add to that? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: The only thing I would add is, we do have a strategic view. We invest in projects that we think increase our ability to meet what we consider to be higher octane requirements in the future. We like the idea of small, sort of quick-hitting projects that give us more feedstock flexibility, because we think we're particularly good at that. And, obviously, we \u2013 we have a strategic view to capture more of or pay ourselves for our own secondary costs, and there's a lot of projects in this. We just have made the decision to be careful about communicating more around the timeframe of where we do have an FID decision versus just sort of \u2013 we're trying to say, conceptually, this is how we view the world. Trust us that we have plenty of projects that fit into that space and we're going to execute them rateably, and on a predictable basis. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And so then, when I think about the $1 billion annually through 2021, and then the illustrative number of 1.2 to 1.4, So is it right to say that that gets you to your 25% IRR? Is that the way to think about it? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, so the way that we've talked about this, is we wanted to illustrate the fact that we did have attractive growth projects in place. And so, half of that capital is deemed to be refining projects, which have the higher 25% return threshold. Could be 24%, could be 28%. But they're typically in that range or better. And, on the logistics side, we know that those tend to be lower-risk projects, and so they tend to have lower return thresholds. And so that's where we use kind of a 12% to 15% threshold for. And that capital is split 50/50 between those two categories. And if you just extrapolate out where that would take you, you get to your $1 billion to a $1.2 billion of incremental EBITDA resulting from a capital program that would be executed every year for the next five years. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, got you. And this is the last question. The open season on Keystone XL, are you guys still committed to take capacity to that line? And I guess especially given some of the issues going on in Venezuela, does that make it more important? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I think we remain committed to the line, and we think that the U.S. Gulf Coast with the high complexity refining assets is best home for the growing production of Canadian crude. So, we're working a number of commercial options to continue to support that Pipeline. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Faisel. Operator : And our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Well, most of this has been hit, but I guess maybe following up on the recent comments. One of the questions here on the export terminals in Port Arthur and Corpus. Recent headlines, the LOOP would be considering the possibility of exports, and I believe you've got an interest there. So, how does that fit into the overall process? Does it change anything you would do? Or is it just a longer term enhancement? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Roger, this is Gary. I think what we understand is being contemplated at LOOP, at least in the short term, is a fairly small capital investment that will allow limited exports out of LOOP. We think around the neighborhood of 50,000 barrels a day, which in our mind is not really significant in terms of impacting the overall capability. But that's exactly what we're doing, is we're evaluating the existing logistics and the volume leaving, and when those logistics start to become taxed, then we can look at adding to those, either through what Rich talked about at Corpus or Port Arthur, as those opportunities become available to us. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Take a little while to fill up a VLCC at 50,000 barrels a day? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, it's exactly right. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, and then kind of getting back to some of the macro questions here. We've seen the northern or let's call it the Atlantic market, product market, tighten up quite a bit. Nice inventory draws here, and in Europe. Given that we've had really high throughputs here, what do you kind of identify as what's helped us see the market change from kind of Memorial Day to the 4th of July period? It didn't appear to be lower run rates here or in Europe. So I was just curious, did we see bigger product draws into markets that are harder for us to identify? I'm thinking Africa or anywhere else. Or was it just demand picked up? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I think it was a combination. So, we certainly saw an increase in demand from the first quarter to second quarter domestically. And then we've seen a big pull into Mexico and South America that's really helped us create the inventory draws. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. I appreciate the help. Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Roger. Operator : And at this time, we have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to John Locke for closing remarks. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay, thanks, Vanessa. We appreciate everybody joining us today. Please contact our IR team if you have any additional questions. Thank you. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to the Valero Energy Corporation reports 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. My name is Vanessa, and I will be the operator for today's call. Please note that this conference is being recorded, and I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke, Vice President, Investor Relations. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO, Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering, Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions, after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me or our Investor Relations team after the call. Now, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor Provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. What I would like to do before we discuss our quarterly financial results is to talk about the hurricanes, and how proud I am of our Valero team, and the energy industry as a whole, for the way we responded to these natural disasters. Hurricane Harvey's path touched almost all of Valero's Gulf Coast refineries. It made landfall just northeast of Corpus Christi, before proceeding inland to just east of Three Rivers near Victoria. The storm then reversed course, short of reaching our headquarters in San Antonio, and moved eastward along the Texas Gulf Coast to the Houston/Beaumont/Port Arthur region, where it stalled and dumped 50 inches of rain in the span of four days, before continuing into Louisiana, and ultimately moving inland and dissipating. We shut down our Corpus Christi and Three Rivers refineries prior to Harvey's arrival, and reduced rate at our three plants in the Houston and Port Arthur area, eventually shutting down Port Arthur due to flooding. Our team worked hard to get these plants safely back up and running, and we only experienced extended delays at Three Rivers and Port Arthur. Hurricane Irma had a less direct impact on our refining operations, but our commercial team and business partners worked tirelessly to prepare for and restore the supply chain as soon as possible. While our operations have returned to normal, we recognize that people and communities affected by the storm are still recovering, particularly those along the southern Gulf Coast and in the Houston and Port Arthur areas. In response, Valero provided financial assistance, meals, water, shelter, fuel, and other support to employees and their affected communities during the storm and the recovery. One of the things that I was most encouraged by, was the display of the American spirit and our determination to help each other during these times of need. From the efforts of the dedicated employees fighting back the onslaught of torrential rain and rising flood waters, to all those Gulf Coast residents who banded together to rescue their neighbors and help with recovery and cleanup, it was a defining moment. An event like this shows the efficiency of the supply chain in the refining and energy sector which, frankly, is not fully appreciated on a day-to-day basis. To think that the epicenter of the refining industry on the Gulf Coast could take a direct hit from a Category 4 hurricane and keep supply disruptions as short lived as they were was impressive. I applaud our employees, our local, state and federal government officials, and all of our business partners who worked closely with us on the front lines to return the supply of our fuels to affected communities. Now, despite the hurricane impacts, we're pleased to report another good quarter of results for the company, which John will share with you shortly. Last quarter, I mentioned that we were extending our participation in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program to more of our facilities. I'm happy to report that our St. Charles and Memphis refineries were awarded STAR status by OSHA, distinguishing Valero as a refining company with the most OSHA VPP STAR sites. These are noteworthy achievements for Valero that demonstrate our focus and commitment to safety and reliability. Moving on to the markets, overall, we're pleased to see margins improving compared to last year. This improvement is primarily due to continued strong domestic and export product demand, as well as ample supplies of crude, notwithstanding the impact of the OPEC cuts on the medium and heavy sour discounts. Our system's flexibility allowed us to shift our feedstock diet to maximize domestic sweet crudes and capture wider discounts versus Brent. We continue to adhere to our disciplined capital allocation strategy, and also made progress on our growth investments. We expect to complete the Diamond Pipeline and Wilmington cogen projects within the next two months, and we're eager to see the incremental earnings contribution from these projects beginning in 2018. Construction also continues on the Diamond Green Diesel expansion and the Houston alkylation unit, and we recently announced the Central Texas pipeline and Pasadena marine terminal projects. Lastly, with regard to returns to stockholders, we returned $600 million through dividends and stock buybacks in the third quarter. This results in a 58% pay out of adjusted cash flow in operating activities year-to-date. So we're well-positioned to exceed our target range of 40% to 50% for the year. So with that, John, I will hand the call back to you. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you, Joe. For the third quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $841 million, or $1.91 per share compared to $613 million or $1.33 per share, in the third quarter of 2016. Third quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $571 million or $1.24 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany our release. Operating income for the refining segment in the third quarter of 2017 was $1.4 billion, compared to $934 million for the third quarter of 2016, which has been revised retrospectively to reflect the VLP segment. The increase from 2016 is attributed primarily to higher gasoline and distillate margins, and wider discounts for domestic sweet crudes relative to Brent crude, partly offset by higher premiums for residual feedstocks, and narrower discounts for medium and heavy sour crudes versus Brent. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 33,000 barrels per day higher than the third quarter of 2016, despite Hurricane Harvey related impacts. Throughput capacity utilization was 92% for the third quarter of 2017. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.71 per barrel were $0.17 per barrel higher than the third quarter of 2016, mostly due to higher energy costs in the third quarter of 2017. The ethanol segment generated $82 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2017, compared to $106 million in the third quarter of 2016. The decrease from 2016 was primarily due to lower margins, resulting from higher corn and lower distillers grain prices. Operating income for the VLP segment in the third quarter of 2017 was $69 million, compared to $56 million in the third quarter of 2016. The increase from 2016 was mainly due to contributions from the Meraux and Three Rivers terminals and the Red River pipeline which were acquired in September 2016 and January 2017, respectively. For the third quarter of 2017, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $229 million, and net interest expense was $114 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $497 million, and the effective tax rate was 30% in the third quarter of 2017. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $8.5 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.2 billion. Of which, $116 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 24%. At the end of September, we had $5.1 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $720 million was available for only VLP. We generated $1 billion of net cash from operating activities in the third quarter. Excluding the negative impact from a working capital increase of $315 million, cash generated was approximately $1.4 billion. With regard to investing activities, we made $565 million of growth and sustaining capital investments, of which $73 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. Moving to financing activities, we returned $600 million to our stockholders in the third quarter. $309 million was paid as dividends, and the balance was used to purchase 4.2 million shares of Valero common stock. As of September 30, we had approximately $1.6 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to expect capital investments for 2017 to be $2.7 billion, with approximately $1.6 billion allocated for sustaining the business, and $1.1 billion for growth. Included in the total are turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.65 million to 1.7 million barrels per day. U.S. Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day. U.S. West Coast at 265,000 to 285,000 barrels per day. And North Atlantic at 465,000 to 485,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $3.90 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation for the third quarter to be around $215 million, and net interest expense should be around $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $495 million. Lastly, we expect RIN expense for the year to be between $800 million and $900 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : And thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Joe, I guess let's dive in on everybody's kind of favorite refining, non-refining topic of RINs here. Obviously, some news has flowed through, both positive and negative, in the last time we talked. And I'm just curious, if we think about there's the RIN expense number, and then there's obviously some magnitude of recovery you're able to achieve. Can you give us any guidance on kind of how that flows back through, what you've been able to do to mitigate the expense, and then maybe what you can do forward? And let's assume there isn't going to be a meaningful policy change in the next 12 months. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: All right. Well, fair enough. The number that we would share on the actual RIN cost is the $800 million to $900 million. So I won't speculate on how it affects the marketing volumes and so on. But what I will tell you is, I think you can see it from the release. We're continuing to invest in assets that allow us to blend more and to export more. So we've got a very strong focus on logistics and on the wholesale market expansion. Now, relative to this policy situation, Roger, this RFS fight is far from over. As you'd expect, those that are enjoying this windfall are aggressively defending their positions and we have a counter view. Why don't I let Jason just give you some insights into our perspective on what's occurred, and then maybe where we go. Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Yeah, this is Jason. You all probably saw this letter Administrator Pruitt sent to these Midwestern senators, here in the last week about potential changes to the RFS that the EPA was looking at. In the letter, he said they decided they weren't going to move the point of obligations. They weren't going to lower the biodiesel volumes under the notice they were looking at, and they weren't going to grant export RINs, which is another idea they were looking at. Of course, we are disappointed in how this went down since it looks like political pressure resulted in short circuiting the policy review process. Now, that's just not good government. It's one thing to have a full balanced review of a proposal and decide it's not the right thing for the country, and it's another to be bullied and abandoning the analysis midstream, which is what it looks to us what happened this time. Still the White House, the EPA and Congress have all acknowledged that high RIN prices are a problem for the refiners. This is not the way the program is supposed to work. So, they're going to continue to get pressure until we get the situation addressed. We're going to continue to pursue our legal, regulatory, and legislative options, as are others, and we're going to keep up the fight. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. I guess maybe changing tact just a little bit. Other big issue, if you look out there is a pretty big difference in some of the light crude pricing, particularly thinking WTI, Midland or Cushing, relative to Gulf Coast prices. Can you give us an idea of how you are able to take advantage of that along the Gulf Coast, or maybe sort of a net crude pricing you are able to achieve through some of your marketing and pipeline access? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Roger, this is Gary. I guess, we've raised our capacity to run light sweet crude. So, we're now about 1.6 million barrels a day of light sweet crude processing capability, with the addition of the toppers in Corpus and Houston. In the Mid-Continent itself, we have 300,000 barrels of refining capacity between Ardmore and McKee, and the Diamond Pipeline, which will start up in December. Then puts Memphis with competitive access to that Midland Cushing market as well, which gives us about 500,000 barrels a day of equivalent Mid-Continent refining capacity. In addition that, we've worked very hard to secure logistics to give us competitive access to Midland and Corpus, and also competitive access to Midland and Cushing at our Houston refineries. And we've also added Line 9, which gives us exposure to that Brent TIR. So, a lot of this work that we've done on logistics over the past several years, we feel like puts us in great position to be able to take advantage of that light sweet, sweet differential. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from are Spiro Dounis with UBS Securities. Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, I just want to start off here. Valero has been a strong steward of capital over the last few years, and it just seems like the market is really starting to recognize your tight belt on spending and strong capital return. But I can't help but notice the large cash balance, low debt levels, strong currency and share price now. It just screams like maybe you should be investing here. So, just wondering, do you think like you are reaching the point where a pivot to maybe more spending makes sense, whether it be refining midstream, or expansion up or down the value chain? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I mean, Spiro, that's a good question. I think you understand the way we look at the use of capital. And we do have a strong cash position. We do have a strong balance sheet. Acquisitions are very opportunistic, as you well know. And we look at everything. To have an effective acquisition for Valero, it's got to be one that there's synergy involved in. And so, that's one of the primary considerations. We have a great portfolio of assets today. So, we're not compelled to do something just because of where we find ourselves. And then we always evaluate the returns that we could achieve with an acquisition or a growth project with that of buying back our shares. And, frankly, we still feel that we're undervalued at the price we're at today. So that competition for the use of what we would deem to be the discretionary cash flow, remains. So, I think you'll see us continue to look at opportunities as they present themselves. I think that you can expect that capital projects will continue to percolate up, and if the returns are there for those projects, we're going to do them. But I mean, nominally, our capital budget is going to be in this, $2.7 billion to $3 billion range. That's just what we feel that we can execute effectively. And if, for some reason, we find some very interesting projects that would increase that number going forward, we've told you guys that we'll make our case with you on why it's a good idea. Anyway, I think what you should expect is a bit more of the same going forward. Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC : Fair enough. Fair enough. And then maybe just general comments around the market here. I think you've got refined products supply lower than it's been in a while, and as you head into winter time here, I don't think we've seen distillate this low in years. And I guess, historically, that kind of what's led to a ramp up in gasoline production too early in the spring. So maybe just as you look into 2018, the setup right now from an inventory standpoint, is it the surprise you? Are we looking at things being better than what you expected maybe earlier this year? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, I think even pre-hurricane, you saw typically during that time period, you see some pretty good builds in distillate and distillate inventories were flat or even falling even before you had the hurricane effect. So, then when you had the supply disruption, it's definitely put us in a very good position in terms of inventory heading into the winter, the heating oil season, with much cold weather at all, I think we're in for a very strong distillate season. And then I think the point you made is accurate, the last several years, distillate hasn't been strong enough to really force refineries into the max distillate mode, and it's kind of created a gasoline build heading into driving season. But this year, it looks like with the strength in distillate, refineries will operate in a max diesel mode, which will help avoid the gasoline build and should be supportive of the gasoline crack next year. Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC : Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, guys. Good morning, everybody. I've got \u2013 I'll take my full quota of two, if I may. Joe, the RIN question from earlier, I wonder if I could just add a bit of follow-up to that. What are your options to mitigate your RIN exposure? I'm thinking exports, retail, other things you can do, if this is going to drag on a bit more, because it looks like the RIN guidance, the cost guidance has ticked up a little bit from what you had previously. So I'm just wondering what your response will be now that that line of potential resolution appears to have stalled for now? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, no, Doug, that's a great question. And I think if you look at the projects that we've announced, okay. You look at the pipeline that will take products into the market area, we're going to own a terminal, it'll allow us to blend. We're aggressively expanding our wholesale marketing business. And then the terminal at Houston that we've announced with Magellan is going to allow us to export more product. We don't have our heads in the sand on this, by any stretch of the imagination, and we will continue to develop projects which allow us to deal with this issue. Again, though, Doug that being said, I think this fight is far from over. There's a clear realization, as Jason stated, not only at the White House and in Congress, but also with the regulators, that the RFS as it is structured today is broken. And it's not achieving the objectives of the legislation when it was implemented. And so there will be changes, and we'll continue to deal with it strategically, with the things we can control, and we'll continue to deal with it legislatively and from a regulatory front, to try to come up with some type of a reasonable solution to this. But we are doing what we can, Doug, to try to mitigate this expense. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I will wait to hear what you've to say on that on a future date. My follow-up is really, I guess, you kind of snuck this one out at a third-party conference, resetting the payout ratio to cash flow, and I really got to commend you guys for doing that in terms of the transparency, but my question is, basically, to get the full benefit of that, one would imagine that it resets your dividend yield, to some extent, that's already happened. But now that you're where your share price is trading, you've obviously been very cognizant about when to do buybacks, and what's really at the back of my question is, assuming we get a corporate tax reduction, one would imagine that your corporate cash flow is going to take another step higher through the cycle, what is your current thinking on the buyback versus dividend split as you go forward? And with this reset in the target, are we likely to see greater emphasis on dividend growth going forward now? I'll leave it there. Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Doug. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. On the reset of the target, I do not think that really affects our absolute dollar payout, but going forward, we're just going to provide it from a \u2013 with a different metric, we'll provide the guidance versus the different metric. You know, in regard to the dividend, our current plan is to review the dividend for increases annually, and to pay a dividend at the high end of our peer group range. Regarding share repurchases, they will be funded from our excess cash flow. So as we generate excess cash flow, we'll compare the repurchase with our alternative uses of cash, and if the repurchases is the best use then we'll repurchase some more shares. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I don't want to take up my quota here maybe, just an observation, your yield is now trading in line with ExxonMobil, just to put it in context which one would suspect that dividend growth gets rewarded in the relative yield of the share price, I guess, is what I'm saying. Just an observation, but I appreciate your answer and, yeah, I like the moves. Thanks a lot. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBS Capital Markets. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, everyone. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Brad. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Joe, morning. You've obviously announced this new Mexico terminal sort of partnership, can you talk through sort of what having that terminal gives you that you didn't have before, as it relates to selling into Mexico? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey, Brad, this is Gary. We have secured a long-term deal that gives us access to deepwater marine terminal in Veracruz, Mexico. From there, we can supply inland terminals in Puebla and Mexico City. So we expect that to be in operation sometime in the first quarter of 2019. In addition to that, we continue to ramp up our cross-border volume to supply the market. And we're also exploring other opportunities to supply to some of the other major population centers. At this time, we're not ready to communicate any of those opportunities. In addition to all the work going on in logistics, we are also engaged with a number of retailers and distributors regarding wholesale volume to supply both branded and unbranded volumes to them. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: So, Brad, I mean there's really two benefits, right? Number one, we sell barrels into Mexico today. This provides us with a footprint and the opportunity to capture additional margin on those barrels. And then it provides the opportunity to grow. It's a market where consumption is growing. Same is true with other parts of Latin America. And that's why we continue to look to those also. And then, of course, you get the other benefit. You have a RIN related benefit associated with securing those markets and exporting more into them. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That's great color, guys. Thanks. And I guess maybe sticking with Gary, just on the Venezuela front. Obviously, you guys are big buyers of Venezuelan crude. I've heard a lot of anecdotes recently about quality declines there, and just general difficulty as it comes to payments. Any color you can give there about how you guys are thinking about Venezuela as a source going forward would be great. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Sure, our volumes from Venezuela have been fairly consistent. We certainly see the struggles that they have. Some of that shows up in the load windows. It's difficult to get the load windows, but we've been getting the volume, and we have seen some degradation in quality, but the commercial terms that we have on our contracts with Venezuela have price deducts that go along with those qualities. So we really haven't seen any problems as of yet. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks all. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey, Paul. Are you there? Operator : It seems that he has dropped. I will move on to the next question. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Joe, two questions, maybe the first one will be for Gary, actually, for the Diamond Pipeline, when is that going to start up, and when the linefill going to be? What are the tariffs that we're talking about on there? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. So Diamond Pipeline, we'll be doing linefill in November and we expect the pipeline to be in operation in December. To kind of get an idea of the economics today, we supply Memphis from the Gulf, and it's really an LLS plus pipeline tariff. When Diamond is in service, it will be Cushing or Midland TI plus the Diamond tariff. So it really is that WTI to LLS spread that you would look at. Today that spread is around $6.30. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So Gary, should I interpret what you say is that the tariff will be about the same as that from the Gulf Coast up to Memphis today? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: No, There's a little difference in the tariffs, but it's not too significant. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And that when you're getting the oil from Cushing on the WTI (29:51) the Gulf Coast, are we going to see any yield difference or any things that we need to take into consideration in addition to the LLS, WTI spread? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, we'll have a number of grades that the \u2013 one of the reasons we like Diamond is it gives us access to a number of different crude grades and certainly, depending on what crude grades are economic at the time, there can be a yield shift associated with the crudes. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But that's not in your base economic? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: No, it's not. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. A second one, Joe, on the IMO 2020, does Valero have any plan or expect to launch refining CapEx projects associated with that to shift your yield? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Why don't I let Lane and Gary weigh in on this. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Paul, this is Lane. So we obviously are looking at that and we have a view. Our existing assets will clearly benefit from that regulatory change, and we have several big projects that are in our gating process. We're not in a position to talk about them publicly, but we definitely understand that'll change the market not only for fuel oil, but we believe that the replacement fuel will be diesel. So, you'll see a fairly positive economics from that sort of resid to diesel spread. So, yes, we are looking at projects to take advantage of that. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Is there any timeline link that you guys may come to a FID decision, or any kind of timeline you can share? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes, we will get to some FID decisions in the first half of next year. Maybe even as early as the first quarter of next year. We just got to go through our gating process and get the engineering done. And so, it'll be sometime next year when we would provide a little more clarity to everyone as to what we're deciding on and what we're going to invest in. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And would those be in the, say, $1 billion, $1.5 billion kind of project? Or will it be much smaller? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: All very excellent questions, but I think I've probably said about as much as I can. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Paul, that was number three, okay? Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: We love talking to you. We'll get out there with it soon enough though. And Lane answered it properly. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, hi. Good morning. I suppose I'll ask one more question a slightly different way there on the back of Paul's question which is, this range of CapEx that you've generally talked about, this kind of 2.5, I guess it's $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion type of range. Would any of these projects be big enough that it would influence that, or do you still think that you're generally going to operate within that range over the next few years? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: No, I don't think we're ready at this point in time to tell you that we're going to jump above that range. And the projects are material, but it goes into the discipline around selecting the ones with the best rates of return that position us best to grow in the future. And so, that's our focus. Projects take several years to construct. And so, even if it's a $1.5 billion project, you're talking $500 million, $600 million a year. So, I don't think you should expect that you're going to find us jumping to $3.5 billion to $4 billion of CapEx. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then, certainly, I can appreciate all of your comments about the efforts on the Gulf Coast. I thought I'd just ask about where Valero is at in terms of, as we entered the fourth quarter, were there any residual effects anywhere in your system? I guess, I'm thinking maybe Port Arthur, or would you say you are fully back up and running by the start of the quarter? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Phil, this is Lane. So Port Arthur would have been the refinery that had the biggest lingering effect going into the fourth quarter, but our operations are back to normal as of now, so. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then last question for Joe. Joe, you've talked about this $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of project EBITDA that's going to be coming over the next few years. $300 million to $400 million of that's in execution phase. So, can you talk \u2013 Diamond is coming, Wilmington is coming, Diamond Green Diesel, how much should we expect in 2018 uplift, run rate basis? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. Why don't John give you some insight there. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Phil, so we've got Diamond Pipeline and Wilmington cogen that's coming up. We have given that slide 13 in our deck, so you can have a longer term view of expected EBITDA. We really don't break it down by year, so we don't have specific guidance on those two that you can expect next year. But you can kind of triangulate on the IRR thresholds that we've given in the slide deck, and use the base cost for those two projects to get a ballpark, depending on your price assumption. But what we have done in the past, and you can see in the slides on the toppers, was do a make good after there's some time where they operate, and we can kind of see what they are contributing. And I would think, for larger projects, we would continue to do that. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, would the run rate of the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion generally be fairly linear over this next five years, more broadly? John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, we don't have guidance on if it's lumpy or smooth, but as the projects come online, we'll look at it and talk about them a little bit. That's really all we can say. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning. Question for you. I was hoping to clarify on this VLP drop of $508 million. Can you clarify how much of that is going to be financed in the form of units versus cash? Basically trying to figure out how much cash is going to actually land on the balance sheet in 4Q? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, hey, Blake. This is Joe. Donna is going to give an answer to this. Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, so, the net cash inflow to VLO for that should be a little north of $400 million. There will be some unit take-backs, but it'll be relatively small and less than $50 million. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. And then, Gary, back on the previous question on shifting toward maximum distillate yield. I don't believe you stated this, but I was looking at your 3Q levels, and it looks like you were running about 38% distillate yield. I'm just curious, is that kind of the upper end of what you think the system can do or, I guess, how much flex do you have there? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: We generally say we have ability to swing about 5% of our yield slate. I would say, for the third quarter, we weren't in a max distillate mode for a good portion of the quarter. So, I think that's kind of the amount of flexibility you will see in the yields. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: And you think that's indicative of kind of industry? So, in other words, there may be another 2% or 3% or so ability to kind of flex more toward distillate going forward? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I would assume most people are similar to us. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Blake. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, team. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Neil. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: The first question was around the product export market. I just want your guys' perspective in terms of where ultimately the barrels are going, and the outlook for product exports as we roll into 2018 here? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: This is Gary. The third quarter, we did 88,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports, and we did 251,000 barrels a day of diesel exports. I think, especially on the diesel, you definitely saw some hurricane impacts. Prior to the hurricane, we were over 300,000 barrels a day of diesel exports. And then, certainly, with the hurricane, those volumes dropped. November, you know with November trade, we saw wide open arbs to go both to South America and to Europe. December trade, it looks like certainly a big pull again to Latin America. For the first few days of December trade, the arb Europe has been closed, but our traders expect it to open up. So we don't really see that there will be much of a material difference in export demand. In fact, we expect it to grow, as we see growth in South America. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I appreciate. And then the follow up, Gary, just on Brent TI. So you talked about how the system is switching to maximize lights, but do you have any views in terms of what's driving it this wide? It seems like LLS is very firm here. Houston pricing is actually relatively firm. It seems like there's a congestion or bottleneck around Cushing, but any color, as folks who are in the market in terms of what's driving the differential as wide as it is, and then just kind of how you are thinking about that spread going into 2018 as well. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, so, I think what you're seeing in Brent TI is really a combination of factors. It's strength in Brent and weakness in TI. So, the strength in Brent, you've seen a pull from Asia of North Sea barrels, and you've seen good refining margins in Europe, and so it's pushed the Brent contract into backwardation. And then on TI, you've had weakness, and some of that was driven from the hurricanes. You had decreased demand for TI with refining capacity down. And then the hurricanes also hindered our ability to export the crude. Following that period, now you've had a period where you have some Mid-Continent refineries and turnarounds. It looked like, at the peak, 400,000 to 500,000 barrels of refining capacity that's down, and so it begun to stress the logistics a little bit. So the MarketLink line and the Seaway line are both under proration, and so it's really then caused this weakness in TI. So, certainly, it'll improve some as Mid-Continent refining capacity comes back online. But as we continue to seek production growth, I think, you'll see that pipeline tariffs are meaningful again, and we would expect to see a little bit wider Brent TI through next year. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks guys. I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Chi. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Interesting development on Capline last week. Can you talk about the company's interest in possibly locking up line space on a potential reversal of that line, into St. James and Meraux and how are you thinking in general about the long-term mix of Canadian heavies into your Gulf Coast system? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Chi, this is Gary. It's really difficult for us to be able to comment because at this stage, we're not sure what's going to feed a Capline reversal. They said 300,000 barrels a day. We're not sure what feeds it. In general, though, we have connectivity into Memphis through Capline, so a reversal gives us more optionality at Memphis. And then I think if it is Canadian heavy, it gives us more access to Canadian heavy at our St. Charles refinery, which is a positive as well. But at this stage, it's just too early for us to really comment on anything we would do with that. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Well, does the Capline reversal change your support at all for Keystone XL moving in? I mean, you can get barrels into Patoka off Keystone. And how are you thinking about that? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, we're still supportive of Keystone XL. To us, it's the most efficient way to bring the barrels in. But we'll see what happens with that and then what happens with Capline. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. And on Latin American heavies, you talk about Venezuela, but certainly there's the declining production throughout that region. How do you think that plays out longer term on availability of Latin American heavy into your region and how does that influence Maya differential longer term? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, so I think you see some decline in South America but we see Canadian heavies continuing to ramp up, and so I think some of the lost barrels that you have from South America will be replaced by additional Canadian heavies. We certainly see that while the OPEC cuts are in place, that the quality differentials can be narrower. But when you get the OPEC barrels, you'll see wider differentials, and then as you move closer to this IMO 2020 date, we think that the quality differentials will be very wide during that period of time. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And maybe just one general question here. Joe, you talked about the hurricane impacts and supply chain efficiencies in your remarks, but is there any way you guys can get more fuel into Puerto Rico to help those people out? By all accounts, there's still a shortage of everything and it just seems like we need a private sector to step in and take a lead here to help out the situation there. Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Chi, that's a really nice thought. I mean, we have provided financial support into Puerto Rico, as well as Mexico after the earthquakes. And then, of course, as a result of the hurricanes here. And from a fuel supply source, Gary. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, we certainly can look at it. I can't say that we've had any calls for fuel, but I'll look into it, Chi. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: But we sure wouldn't hold it back. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: No. Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yeah, well, thanks for those thoughts. Appreciate it. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Jenkins with Raymond James. Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess maybe a couple on midstream from me, so last quarter we talked about M&A versus organic growth and, Joe, I appreciate your response to an earlier question. And you mentioned how much you prefer maybe the organic side given control of development and certainly seen that with investment or the announcements you've made in September. But I guess, I'm curious with the difficulties playing out in midstream stocks lately, and maybe the relative strength of VLP if maybe you see things looking better for M&A. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, I mean, look, what we've seen \u2013 when we participated in the M&A market around, let's just say gathering systems, seems like they're still at pretty lofty multiples, okay? So then you get into, is it better to try to buy something like that or is it better to go ahead and do the development yourself? So obviously, we've seen plenty of opportunity to strengthen our system, both for Valero and for VLP by doing the organic projects. But, Rich, is there anything you'd want to add to this? Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.: It's basically what you said, the assets, the transactions that we see are trading north of 20-time multiples and we've got a good inventory of organic projects. And we've got the EBITDA upstairs, the dropdowns. So acquisitions are part of the growth strategy, but right now we've got a lot of good stuff at much more attractive multiples. But we do look at all this stuff. Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, appreciate that, guys. And then maybe thinking on the financing plan for the two midstream JVs announced in September, do you think we could view it more like Diamond where we build it at VLO and drop into VLP, or is there a thought to get VLP involved sooner? And I'll leave it there. Thanks guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, and Donna may want to speak to this. But I mean, I would say that generally our ultimate goal here as VLP grows is to be able to allow it to be able to do its projects and its acquisitions on its own. Today, Valero still has absolutely no problem providing what \u2013 I won't call it financial support, but being on point for taking the asset and adding it to the drop inventory. Anything you'd add? Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.: No, I mean, right, so as soon as VLP can get to that size and scale to take this on, to take that negative cash impact on itself, we're certainly looking forward to doing it that way. Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Understood. Thanks, everyone. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Justin. Operator : And our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Maybe just a couple of quick ones. On run rates, your run rate guidance, in terms of volume throughput into 4Q is relatively in line with our expectations, but I think there's been some talk of deferrals of turnaround activity and maintenance activity into earlier next year to take advantage of the opportunity. I mean, are you seeing any of that across your portfolio or as you look broadly across the industry, do you have expectations for turnaround activity, I guess deferrals now or what it means for next year's maintenance period in February and March? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, Ryan, I'll start with the last question. We don't really give forward views on where we're going to be in the first half or even next year on our turnaround and not really on the industry. What I will say is that we deferred our McKee turnaround in the Mid-Continent for about two weeks to help get in the better contractor situation and supply situation, and so that was really just a two-week delay. We did move out a catalyst change in our LCO hydrocracker at Houston into next year. And that's pretty much the extent of our deferrals. We didn't have a lot of turnaround activity in the Gulf Coast going on or the Mid-Continent for that matter going on in the fourth quarter of this year. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you. And then maybe just one more quick one. In third quarter, I believe your feedstock was, I think you ran about 52% sweet. You were at 48% sweet last quarter. Prior to the start-up of Diamond, is there any additional flex in the mix to run additional sweet and get closer to the 1.6 million barrels of capacity or is that about max? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, if you look at the way we ran in the third quarter out of that 1.6 million barrels a day of capacity, we utilized about 85% of that. In the fourth quarter, certainly some of the underutilized capacity that we had was the result of the hurricane, so that capacity is back online. But with the heavy Canadian discounted to Houston TI barrel by 15%, economics are really pushing us towards the heavy at some of our plants, and then light sweet after that. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Ryan. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Faisel. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Two questions. First, the decision to take back a small number of units in the VLP transaction, was that a function of the current market conditions for MLPs or was it just a function of you guys have $5 billion of cash in the balance sheet and you don't need to take back the cash? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: The decision to take back some of those shares was largely to mitigate some of our tax exposure on the deal. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, okay, got you. And then just, I guess, following up on that. The current cash balance of over $5 billion, no matter how much stock you buy back and how much you increase the dividend, the balance still remains. So I just want to understand your philosophy around that. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: That's a good thing. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. Faisel, I mean, that's a good question. I take it your question is what are we going to do with all the cash. We're going to continue on the path we're on, and as I said earlier, we think our shares are undervalued. So the capital allocation framework that we've put in place has worked very well for us. We do \u2013 Mike mentioned we look at the dividend. I don't think we're at the top on where we're going to have dividend payouts going forward. And then we, again, a significant transaction, we chew up some of the cash. So again, we've told you in the past, our objective is not to hoard cash and just sit here with a ton of cash on the balance sheet. We're going to put it to work and we'll do it through the context of the capital allocation framework. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And when you say that an acquisition could chip some of the cash away, is it you've tried \u2013 you've looked for stuff and you just can't make it work or is it just the timing is not right? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, even with a lot of cash, it doesn't make sense to overpay for something. And when we \u2013 we have a very disciplined approach to looking at acquisitions. And as Rich stated, on the logistics side, 20 times multiples seem to be a little bit rich when we can do organic growth projects around logistics at much more attractive economics. Granted, the run rate is longer, the lead time is longer, but the result is much, much better for our owners than it would be if we overpaid for something. So patience isn't something maybe that we're all blessed with, but we're trying to do so and to continue to drive growth, but do it in a reasonable way. Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Joe. Appreciate the comments. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. The latest drop looks to be a bit of a lower multiple than historical. Is that driven more by perhaps higher maintenance CapEx on the assets, or the higher cash component? Is that an issue? And do you see multiples starting to stair step down for ensuing (51:49) drops relative to what you've done in the prior years? Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.: So the combined multiple for the most recent drop is not out of line from our prior drops. It's in that 8.5 time to 9.5 time multiple, and so I wouldn't attribute any higher maintenance or any capital associated with these assets. They're high quality assets. They're \u2013 again, remember, we solve for a IRR pre-tax for these dropdowns, and the multiple just kind of rolls out. So we're in that 12% to 13% pre-tax IRR on these drop downs, but there's nothing funny going on with the maintenance or CapEx associated. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I'm sorry. I may have just misunderstood the press release. Is the combined EBITDA $84 million? Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.: No, it's $60 million. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Oh, okay. I apologize. Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: No, problem, Craig. Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Craig. Operator : And thank you. I see no further questions in queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Locke for closing remarks. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. We appreciate you joining us today. Please contact me or the IR team if you have any additional questions. Thank you. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]  And I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. John Locke. Sir, you may begin. John Locke : Good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on the website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing those tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I\u2019d like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under Federal Securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Well 2017 was certainly a tale of two halves. In the first half of the year, we saw a gradual but steady improvement in margins from the low levels of 2016. The return of global economic growth created strong product demand and, on the supply side, our flexibility allowed us to optimize our system away from the OPEC supply constraint in crudes to capture more margin available on Canadian and domestic crude supply. In fact, we processed a record 1.4 million barrels per day of light crude during the fourth quarter. In the second half of the year, catastrophic weather-related events accelerated the decline in industry product inventories to below five-year averages, brought national attention to the complexity and inefficiency of the U.S. fuel supply chain and renewed appreciation for the critical role that products play in the lives of families and communities. In December, to the delight of many, our nation\u2019s lawmakers passed unprecedented tax reform. We believe tax reform further strengthens the competitive position of the U.S. refining industry versus our global competition through greater tax efficiency and increased earnings power and cash flow generation. We were glad to see this positive step change for American manufacturing businesses and for American families. I\u2019d also like to recognize Valero\u2019s tax accounting and legal teams, who dedicated significant time and effort over the recent months and during the holidays to analyze and account for the requirements of the tax reform. Now looking ahead, we expect a significant reduction in our taxes and effective tax rate versus pretax reform levels. And Valero\u2019s net cash provided by operating activities should also benefit significantly. That being said, you should expect us to remain committed to our capital allocation framework, which prioritizes maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings and nondiscretionary spending to sustain the business and pay our dividends. Incremental discretionary cash flow resulting from tax reform would need to compete with other discretionary uses, including growth investments, M&A, and cash returns. Turning to Valero business, in 2017, we set new operational performance records for safety, reliability, and environmental stewardship. Our accomplishments in these areas exemplify Valero's commitment to premier operations and are key drivers that enable us to deliver more stable earnings. Also, in 2017, we invested $2.4 billion to sustain and grow the business. The Diamond Pipeline in the Wilmington cogeneration unit both started up in November and are running well. The Diamond Pipeline connects Cushing to Memphis and has improved our Memphis refinery's crude supply flexibility, providing a cost advantage versus crude delivered on cap line. The cogeneration unit is helping reduce Wilmington's operating expenses, while also increasing the reliability of its power and steam supplies. Construction on the capacity expansion of the Diamond Green diesel plant in the new Houston alkylation unit remains on track. We expect to complete these projects in the third quarter of 2018 and the first half of 2019, respectively. Our logistics investments in Central Texas and along the Houston Ship Channel are also progressing. Estimated start-ups are in mid-2019 for the Central Texas pipelines and terminals and then early 2020 for the Pasadena Terminal. We also expect to break ground soon on a new 25,000 barrels per day alkylation unit at the St. Charles refinery. This project was recently approved by our Board of Directors. The estimated total cost is $400 million with the start-up scheduled for the second half of 2020. Regarding cash returns to stockholders, we paid out 63% of our 2017 adjusted net cash provided by operating activities, which exceeded our target annual payout range of 40% to 50%. Last week, our Board approved a 14% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.80 per share, or $3.20 annually, further demonstrating our commitment to our investors. In closing, with days of supply for refined light product inventories near five-year lows and continued global economic growth, we expect good demand in domestic and export markets and healthy margins this year. Given our advantaged position as a low-cost manufacturer and premier operator, with flexibility to process a wide range of feedstocks and reliably supply quality fuels to consumers, we are optimistic about 2018. So, with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you John Locke : Thank you, Joe. For the fourth quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.4 billion, or $5.42 per share, compared to $367 million, or $0.81 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $509 million, or $1.16 per share. For 2017, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $4.1 billion, or $9.16 per share, compared to $2.3 billion, or $4.94 per share in 2016. 2017 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.2 billion, or $4.96 per share, compared to $1.7 billion, or $3.72 per share in 2016.  2017 adjusted results exclude an income tax benefit of $1.9 billion from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, while the 2016 adjusted results exclude several items reflected in the financial tables that accompany this release. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to those financial tables.  Operating income for the Refining segment in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $982 million, compared to $645 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding $17 million of expenses primarily related to ongoing repairs at certain of our US Gulf Coast refineries to address damage resulting from Hurricane Harvey, adjusted operating income for fourth quarter 2017 was $999 million. The increase from 2016 is attributed primarily to higher gasoline and distillate margins in most regions and wider discounts for domestic sweet crudes relative to Brent Crude, which were partially offset by narrower discounts for medium and heavy-sour crudes versus Brent and higher premiums for residual feedstocks. Refining throughput volumes averaged 3 million barrels per day, which was 156,000 barrels per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Throughput capacity utilization was 96% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.55 per barrel were $0.19 per barrel lower than the fourth quarter of 2016, mostly due to higher throughput in the fourth quarter of 2017.  The Ethanol segment generated $37 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $126 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease from 2016 was primarily due to lower margins resulting from lower ethanol prices. Operating income for the VLP segment in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $80 million, compared to $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase from 2016 was mainly due to contributions from the Red River Pipeline, which was acquired in January 2017, and the Port Arthur terminal assets and Parkway Pipeline, which were acquired in November of 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, general and administrative expenses were $238 million and net interest expense was $114 million. General and administrative expenses for 2017 were higher than 2016 mainly due to reserve adjustments and a fee for terminating the agreement to acquire certain terminals in northern California owned by Claims All American pipeline LP. Depreciation and amortization expense was $490 million and the effective tax, rate excluding the income tax benefit related to tax reform, was 30% in the fourth quarter of 2017.  With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $8.9 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.9 billion, of which $42 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 23%. At the end of December, we had $5 billion of available liquidity excluding cash, of which $340 million was available for only VLP.  We generated $1.7 billion of net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter. Excluding the favorable impact from a working capital decrease of $800 million, cash generated was approximately $900 million. With regard to investing activities, we made $641 million of growth and sustaining capital investments of which $142 million was for turnarounds and catalyst.  For 2017, we invested $2.4 billion of which $1.3 billion was for sustaining, and $1.1 billion was for growth. Our sustaining capital expenditures were $300 million lower than guidance primarily due to lower turnaround costs and hurricane related delays on certain projects. Moving to financing activities, we returned $727 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter $421 million was for the purchase of 5 million shares of Valero common stock and $306 million was paid as dividends. As of December 31, we had approximately $1.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, including the $2.5 billion of additional repurchase authority approved last week by our board, we have approximately $3.7 billion available for stock buybacks going forward.  We expect capital investments for 2018 to be $2.7 billion with about $1.7 billion allocated to sustaining the business, and $1 billion to growth. Included in this total are the turnarounds, catalyst, and joint venture investments. From modeling our first quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall to the following ranges; U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.65 million to 1.7 million barrels per day; U.S. mid-continent at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day; US West Coast at 250,000 to 270,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4 per barrel. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For 2018, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $800 million. The annual effective tax rate is estimated at 22%. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $115 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $500 million. And lastly, we expect RINs expense for the year to be between $750 million and $850 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Yeah, thank you. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : And congrats on another good quarter there. Joe Gorder : Thank you. Roger Read : I guess could we talk a little bit here, kind of two main things, crude difs, which have been bouncing around quite a bit lately and then your general access to heavy barrels. Given that if I remember correctly, you don't have quite as much pipeline access to a Canadian barrel which means rail\u2019s probably beneficial for you here. And then the further declines in Venezuelan production and what that\u2019s meant along the Gulf Coast for heavy access. Gary Simmons : Hey, Roger, this is Gary. Yeah, we\u2019ve seen difs move quite a bit. I'll start with Venezuela. Although production has been declining in Venezuela, our volumes have remained fairly constant versus our term contracts. We attribute this to the fact that although production is declining, refinery utilization is down in Venezuela and so it's kind of keeping exports available to us. On the crude dif side, we\u2019ve seen some pretty good swings. Obviously, the Western Canadian market is very discounted. WCS and Hardisty this morning is $34 under Brent. And then I think some of the turnaround activity and cold weather in the Gulf has caused the medium sour market at least in the U.S. Gulf Coast a week in some with asking operating close to 580 off of Brent. So, seeing pretty good quality discounts. It doesn't seem to be quite keeping with either the Western Canadian or the medium sour values that we're seeing in the Gulf today. In terms of access, we have good pipeline access really for our Houston area refineries where we don't have as good access as to St. Charles. St. Charles has a lot of capability to process Canadian barrels but we don't have a good way to get it there. And so, we are starting some barge operations from our Hartford terminal where we\u2019ll barge some heavy Canadian into St. Charles which will start in February. Roger Read : And on the rail side, are you seeing the kind of balking from the rails in the US that we\u2019ve seen out of some of the Canadian rail companies? Thinking of the term contracts here. Gary Simmons : Yeah, so what we're really seeing is just that there's not the availability of locomotives in order to move the trains. So real wide arb and great economics to ship crude by rail, but you don't have the power to move the trains. Some of that is the trains have been in grain service and so we see some things that we think could open up some more movements of crude by rail. We're planning to ramp up our volumes through our Lucas terminal to Port Arthur, but so far, it\u2019s been very limited. Roger Read : Okay. Great. Thank you. Gary Simmons : Thanks, Roger. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Doug Terreson : Good morning, everybody. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson : I wanted to get your updated views on the likely market impact of some of the new environmental regulations that are set for the next few years which seem pretty meaningful to me, meaning between Tier 3 sulfur and IMO 2020, my questions whether you feel the US and global refining industries are making adequate enough investments to satisfy the new rules. And then second, how margins for the key products such as the octane sources, fuel oils and crude oil spreads are going to vary. And finally, how Valero\u2019s positioning for these changes. So, there's really three parts. Is the industry ready? Two, what happens to spreads? And, three, how you feel Valero is positioned for these new regulations? Lane Riggs : So, hey, Doug. It\u2019s Lane. Actually, I\u2019m going to start with your last one first. Doug Terreson : Okay. Lane Riggs : Valero is very, very well positioned for certainly IMO. We have a lot of coking capacity and a lot of resid destruction, so we have a lot of pre-investment for that regulation change. And, secondly on that point, the interesting thing about this regulation change is it\u2019s trying to add grassroots capacity in this space of resid destruction. It\u2019s very expensive. So, I think you\u2019ll see the industry do what it can to debottleneck existing units in terms of laying out a lot of capital for the big grassroots unit. That\u2019ll remain to be seen. But it is expensive as compared to some of the other profit units. And with respect to Tier 3, it\u2019s in our strategic view. Tier 3 is going to destroy a lot of octane. Where we are versus the industry, we think we\u2019re better positioned. We\u2019re only going to -- we\u2019re going to spend -- our total spend in this space is $470 million is where we think we are today. We\u2019ve still got about $200 million in front of us. We\u2019ve spent about \u2013 the rest of it is behind us still, but we feel like we\u2019re in a really good position with respect to Tier 3 as well. Doug Terreson : Okay. And you guys want to just make a couple of points on IMO 2020? Or should we wait till we get closer, or? Lane Riggs : Well, in terms of likelihood, or? Doug Terreson : Well, not so much the likelihood. I mean, it feels like it is going to happen, but what do you think it\u2019s that meaningful? And what the key market implications are? Do you have a view there too? Lane Riggs : I\u2019m sorry. So yes. So, I started there. I think absolutely, the fact that we are a heavy coking refinery and resid destruction. Like I said, we are very well positioned for. And that regulation is going to cost 3% to get very displaced in the world. Doug Terreson : Sure. Lane Riggs : I think everyone is trying to figure out exactly how our industry and the shipping industry is going to try to solve this issue, but it will definitely widen as you don\u2019t run 3% and you probably reuse fuels that are a sub 2 distillate. You\u2019re going to see that driver, which is the driver for coking and other resid destruction between resid and diesel widen out. And I think that\u2019s the market impact. Gary, you want to add anything on that? Gary Simmons : No, I think that\u2019s\u2026 Doug Terreson : Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Joe Gorder : Thank you, Doug. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : Joe, maybe just one to clarify. When you guys are saying that the adjust operating cash flow 40% to 50%, how do you define as just operating cash flow? And also, that if in the event the operating cash flow, however way that you decide, is much better than you expected, should we assume the incremental cash will end up that coming to the shareholder, so you will end up that exit that range? Or that it would be used for other purpose like the debt reduction or maybe increasing the organic CapEx? Joe Gorder : You bet. Mike Ciskowski : Yes, Paul. This is Mike on that. How do we define that? Its net cash provided by operating activities on our cash flow statement, and then we back out the working capital impact. Paul Cheng : Okay. Lane Riggs : And then the second part of the question was on, assuming we have additional free cash flow, what are we going to do with it? Gary Simmons : Right. I mean, as Joe talked about in his opening comments, we\u2019re still going to pay out the 40% to 50% as our target, and this increase in discretionary cash flow will just compete with the nondiscretionary. Lane Riggs : Paul, we put in place several years ago that capital allocation framework, and we\u2019ve adhered to it. And I think perhaps the best forecaster for what we\u2019re going to do going forward is our history. We\u2019ll retain enough cash to be sure that we\u2019ve got the liquidity in the business to do the things we want to do. And to the extent that we end up with surplus cash, I think it\u2019s a fair bet that we\u2019re not going to sit on it. So, again, I think history probably speaks well to what we would probably do going forward. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent in that now for some time. Paul Cheng : Okay. My second question is, is Diamond at full capacity right now? And that if we\u2019re looking at that, what is the incremental margin to Memphis? And comparing to, say, in the fourth quarter, how much is Diamond that you are running? And also, that whether you can give the same number on 9 to Quebec City in the fourth quarter? And what you expect in the first quarter? Lane Riggs : Well, you're a magician. Paul Cheng : We try. Gary Simmons : You want to go ahead? Lane Riggs : Yeah. Gary Simmons : I take the first of those four questions. Lane Riggs : The Diamond Pipeline started up kind of late-ish November. We had a very good start-up, and the line has run extremely well since coming online. December was our first full month of operation, and in December you're really looking at in terms of the economic benefit is that spread between WTI and LLS. In December during our first month of operation, that spread was $5.33 a barrel. January, it remained wide. So, in January, that spread between WTI and LOS averaged $4.18 a barrel. So that kind of gives you an idea of the economic impact that Diamond is having on our system today. Line 9 similar with the wide Brent TIR. We're seeing very good economics through line 9 as well. So, I don't have exactly where that spread was in December and January, but on a prompt basis, line 9 barrel beats an alternative by about $1.20 a barrel. Paul Cheng : But, Gary, do you have that throughput warning that you're shipping from line 9 into Quebec City in the fourth quarter and what you expect in the first quarter? Gary Simmons : So, we don't give guidance on that. We are utilizing our full capacity that we have available to us. Paul Cheng : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate : Joe, I wonder if I can touch on the cash distribution. Obviously, the reset towards cash flow is really giving a lot of clarity to the market, and I think you've been awarded for that. But it does mean that you're buying back shares at pretty much the all-time high in stock price whereas the tax cut obviously resets what are the margin is the low point for your cash flow at the bottom of whatever we think the cycle is now. So, I guess what I'm really trying to get to is how much is too much of a buyback in terms of do you have a limit as to where you would slow down the buyback and skew back towards a more sustainable dividend? Obviously, you've already done that. I'm just wondering how much further you think that balance has to go? And I've got a follow up, please. Joe Gorder : That's a fair question. Mike, do you want to take a crack at this? Mike Ciskowski : Yeah, we have increased as we did just recently our dividend. So that will take up a bigger piece of our 40% to 50% of the target. Now, as our taxes is reduced through tax reform, this amount of available cash flow will increase, and it will -- we'll continue to evaluate that through our capital allocation process as Joe talked about. And it will compete with growth investments and M&A and cash returns. Joe Gorder : Doug, when you think about it, I mean, and this has been a consistent question that we received for several years. Are we buying back shares at 50? Is it too high? Are we buying back shares at 60? Is that too high? And here we are we find ourselves kind of in the mid-90s and is that too high. Frankly, I think our view would be that we remain undervalued, and the paradigm on independent refining is shifting. We are much more focused certainly Valero is on producing free cash flow and maintaining capital discipline around the use of funds. And to the extent that we continue to throw off significant amounts of free cash flow, we're going to have the opportunity to continue to buy back our shares and create higher lows and higher highs in the stock price. So, if you ask me personally, if I think we're overvalued today, I would say the answer is no. And do I think there is upside in the stock price, I'd say yes. And as a result, I think that you should expect that we're going to continue to balance out our payout with repurchases. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the answer. I know it's not an easy one to answer. But I guess we also view that you're kind of shifted to be on S&P 500 yield stock, and I think the dividend for what it's worth probably gets rewarded. But that is our take. Anyway, I appreciate you taking the question. My follow-up is we just had the marathon call before you, and Gary made some really interesting comments I thought about the prospects of getting a RIN resolution by the spring. RIN costs for both diesel and biofuel and ethanol have both come down, it seems. I'm just wondering if you could share your thoughts. Do you share that kind of optimism on a timeline, and if so, what's your best guess on how it plays out from here? Joe Gorder : That's a good question. Doug, Jason Fraser is here, and he runs policy and strategic planning. He's been obviously neck-deep in this particular issue, as have I. And we'll let him share some insights on that. Jason Fraser : Yeah, hi. This is Jason. Things have definitely heated up and received an increased focus here in the past few months, especially with the PDS situation. That dramatically showed how badly the RFS reform is needed. So, let's help shed some light on it. We also do have the two efforts going within the Senate now with Senator Cruz trying to get the Midwest senators to sit down and discuss a near term solution for higher RIN prices, and a solution that would also benefit all producers. We also have Senator Cloridon who has been working very hard and over a long period of time with stakeholders and other senators to try to come up with long-term legislative reform.  So, I didn't hear his comments, so I don't know about his specific Timeline, but there does seem to be more urgency and visibility and effort around this area in the past couple of months. So, we're more optimistic than we have been. Things are looking better. Doug Leggate : Jason, do you think that's - do you think, Jason, that's the reason why RIN costs have really come off a bit in the last couple months? Or is that more seasonal? Joe Gorder : Gary may have more of a view on the market, but that's got to be something effecting it. There's a risk and there is also the EPS has kind of signaled that they're looking at the smaller refiner exceptions, and there's been a lot of discussion of that. If they were to grant those, that could end, not reallocate them to other obligated parties, which is what we think they would do. They would not redistribute that mandate. That would have a negative effect on RIN prices too. So, there are several things floating around. But, Gary, I don't know if Gary has a view beyond that. Gary Simmons : No, I see it the same way. I think any time you read something in the press on potential regulatory changes, you see people that are hoarding RINs, start dumping them in the market figuring that they may be hoarding RINs that aren't worth much in the future. Doug Leggate : Appreciate the answers, guys. And, Gary, I guess, Joe, we'll see you and Gary in New York in a couple of weeks\u2019 time. So, thanks for your time. Joe Gorder : Thank you, Doug. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with UBS. Your line is now open. Spiro Dounis : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just was hoping for comments on the M&A environment for refining assets, specifically here. I think there were a few assets on the block last year and 2016, and it seems like a lot of them got pulled just due to really bid-ask spreads between buyers and sellers. Curious if you're seeing that as still the case? And does your renewed optimism on the refining outlook and tax reform change any of the calculus on valuation for you? Mike Ciskowski : Okay. Yeah, this is Mike. Tax reform does change the economics a little bit on the M&A. We would have the ability to deduct a purchase price of the PP&E in year one. And so, we are in the process of updating our analysis on various potential targets. Joe Gorder : But I don't know of anything in the marketplace today that is really for sale, or that's of interest. So, and you're right. I think the bid-ask spreads not only on refining assets, but on logistics assets also, it's been pretty broad. And as you guys know, we tend to take a look at everything that is out in the market, and then we have a target list of things that we particularly track that we'd be interested in. And it just hasn't come together in a way that has allowed us to execute something that we would be pleased with. So, we'll continue to watch it, but there's just nothing there right now. Spiro Dounis : Got it. Got it. And then just on Mexico, I was wondering if you could update us on the progress of the project there? How it's progressing? And maybe along that line I believe that project was kind of a stepping stone for you into Latin America, and so I guess when do you think you would be able to expand on that position? Rich Lashway : This is Rich here. The facilities are in the progress of acquiring the land for the inland terminals, and their crews should be handed over to who is going to be doing the construction for us here in early February. We expect that all of the facilities would be up and running in the first quarter of 2019. That's kind of on the operational side. Maybe Gary wants to share a little bit on the marketing side. Gary Simmons : Yeah, so I think for us you'll see the ramp-up in penetration into the wholesale market after the terminal comes on. And, yes, we are looking at a lot of different opportunities in Mexico and South America. And we don't really have anything to communicate on that at this time. Spiro Dounis : Understood. Appreciate the color. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC. Your line is now open. Brad Heffern : Good morning, everyone. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Brad. Brad Heffern : Just a question on the new Alki project and the old Alki project, I guess. I mean, so now your two marquee CapEx projects are both Alki, and a lot of your peers have been more focused on the distillate side of the barrel. So, what\u2019s the thesis there? Is this the Tier 3 octane destruction, like you talked about? Or is it just octane demand increasing over time? What makes you pursue that side of things? Lane Riggs : Okay. So, Brent, this is Lane. So, you hit up on the first part of it. We\u2019re optimistic about the requirements in the industry to meet octane for gasoline, and it\u2019s obviously two things are happening there. One is tier 3 is destroying octane. Two, the autos, their trajectory is to require more octane that helps them with their emissions compliance. The other part of that is we\u2019re just, we have a view that NGLs are going to be long, and that\u2019s all a function of the shell play that\u2019s out there. You have all these export facilities, so even as a floor you\u2019re going to have NGL exports to the world. That\u2019s a little different position. So, at the end of the day, it really is sort of a butane to high octane gasoline spread that we\u2019re bullish on. And we think both these projects fit into that strategic view. Brad Heffern : And then our position on diesel, Lane? Gary? Gary Simmons : Well, the way I feel, with diesel, we\u2019ve have made big investments to make diesel. We\u2019ve built two big hydrocrackers, if you remember. And we sort of \u2013 and that was the similar view. It was our NG. It was basically our gas to liquids viewpoint, cheap natural gas a function of shell play making diesel, which is really the world fuel. We\u2019ve invested a lot of money in that area, and so we aren\u2019t really \u2013 going forward, that\u2019s not really what we\u2019re focusing. We\u2019re not focusing on trying to make more diesel unless it\u2019s your construction. Brad Heffern : Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then shifting to California, it\u2019s seeming more likely that the QMD out there if they don\u2019t ban hydrofluoric acid there\u2019s going to be a lot of mitigation procedures required. How are you guys thinking about the potential CapEx spend at Wilmington? And how likely you are to pursue that as an avenue? Mike Ciskowski : Well, we absolutely are. We feel pretty good that all stakeholders are working out there to find the right viable solution for how to mitigate HF in that area. And we are working with the South Coast to get there. And we obviously, depending on how that all works out, we either will or won\u2019t make the right investment, the total investment to meet that to comply. But we\u2019re very optimistic that everybody involved will get to the right place. Brad Heffern : Okay. Thanks all. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is now open. Blake Fernandez : Hey, guys. Good morning. Sticking on the West Coast theme, the margins really collapsed into the second half of the quarter, and maybe this is a question for Gary, but I\u2019m just curious if you have any thoughts on what was driving that. It seemed relative to the rest of the country. It was significantly weaker. I know Torrance was back up and running, but any other thoughts on that? Joe Gorder : Yes, Blake. I think historically you see that weakness in the West Coast in the fourth quarter. This was a little more severe than what we generally see. I think you touched on some of it. Refinery utilization was high. You were in high RVT season, so you had butane kind of swelling the gasoline pool. And then a little bit softer demand with some of the weather issues on the West Coast. I think all that drove to the weakness that you\u2019ve seen. Moving forward, we have a little bit of turnaround activity going on. And then already in Los Angeles, we switched to summer grade gasoline. The Bay will go to summer grade in another couple of weeks, which will help slow supply into the market and start to bring inventories back into balance. Blake Fernandez : Great. Okay. Thanks. And then this may be a question for Mike, but on the tax reform, obviously given that you have some European operations, I was just curious given the $5 billion of cash, should we be thinking about any impacts as far as repatriation and any benefits on that? Joe Gorder : Yes. We do have some cash, both in Canada and the UK, and we could bring that back if we need to. But our cash position here in the U.S. is adequate, and so we don\u2019t need to bring it back at this time. Blake Fernandez : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Justin Jenkins with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Justin Jenkins : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess, Joe, I\u2019m sorry to beat a dead horse here as I think you\u2019ve been pretty clear about capital allocation, but I\u2019m curious if the lower tax rate affects anything as it relates to strategy for VLP, whether it\u2019s drop-downs or the mix of growth spending? Any thoughts here? Lane Riggs : Mike, you or, Rich, you want to talk to it? Or Donna? Joe Gorder : Yes, go ahead. Or on the drop-down, I mean, are you \u2013 I guess it remains to be seen how that \u2013 the tax reform, obviously, it just happened in December, and how that\u2019s going to affect the drop-down activity. The multiples are market-related, and so we just don\u2019t know for sure how tax reform will affect those multiples. Lane Riggs : Well, Mike, and then if you\u2019re doing a drop-down, you\u2019ve got a related-party transaction. And is the treatment on that different than an acquisition from a third party? Donna Titzman : If you\u2019re talking about full extension? Lane Riggs : Yes. Donna Titzman : Yes. So normally from a drop perspective, you need expenses would not be allowed because Valero and VLP are related parties. In regards to third-party acquisitions, VLP would likely not elect that because it does create some significant fluctuations from year to year in the allocation or calculation of remedial income to the public unit holders. So, bonus depreciation has been available for many years and yet, generally, MLPs do not \u2013 have not chosen to take that. I\u2019m not sure if that answers your question, but. Justin Jenkins : No, that\u2019s perfect. I appreciate that. And then maybe just shifting gears here, following up on Roger\u2019s question on access to the Canadian crude, can you talk about the pipeline projects that are in the queue? I\u2019m thinking along the lines of Keystone XL. And then how that might fit into VLO\u2019s overall strategy? Lane Riggs : Yes, so obviously we were big backers of Keystone XL and believe it\u2019s a great project as it kind of brings that heavy Western Canadian oil to the high complexity U.S. Gulf Coast refining system, and direct access to our Port Arthur refinery, so we\u2019re excited that that project\u2019s moving forward, and it will certainly improve our access to the growing production in Western Canada. Justin Jenkins : Perfect. Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll leave it there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Low with Redburn. Your line is now open. Peter Low : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two, please. The first is just on your West Coast operations. Do you see any synergies there between those refineries and the rest of the portfolio? And would you ever consider in the future to just exit that region? And then, secondly, just can you provide an update on your proposed doubling of capacity of Diamond Green Diesel? I\u2019d be interested to understand what Valero\u2019s primary motivation is with DGD? Is it the returns the project makes on its own right? Or rather that it can help mitigate your own biofuel blending costs? Thanks. Lane Riggs : All right. Peter. Well on the West Coast, I mean, there\u2019s some synergies, but largely limited synergies I would say between the West Coast and the rest of the Valero system. That being said, it\u2019s a good operation. We have good management and it is a great option on strong West Coast margins when we experience them. So, it\u2019s part of our portfolio, it cash flows, and so we don\u2019t have any interest to divest ourselves of it. Now, as far as DGD, Martin, do you want to\u2026 Lane Riggs : Yes, on Diamond Green, we have a project underway to go from 160 million gallons a year to 275 million gallons a year. That will start up in the third quarter. We\u2019ve also talked about a second expansion from 275 to 550. That final investment decision will be made in 2018 and it will stand on its own rights. We\u2019ve looked at that as the JV, and we look at the cash that that throws off and decide what we\u2019re going to do. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ll decide there. Peter Low : Thanks. Lane Riggs : Thanks, Peter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Phil Gresh : Yes. Good morning. Just a clarification on the tax reform; you gave the 22% effective rate. Was curious if there was additional savings you\u2019d expect from the bonus depreciation benefits, et cetera, from a cash basis? Whether a percentage basis or $1.00 basis? How you think about it? Joe Gorder : Okay. Yeah, on the reform. What we did was we pro-formed our 2017 results, and we had $3.2 billion of pretax income. We wanted to determine the change in our tax provision as well as the cash taxes, so we assumed that all available capital in 2017 was available for full expensing.  So, in regard to our income statement, the tax provision would be lower by approximately $230 million or $0.50 per share. On the cash side, our cash taxes, our U.S. cash taxes would decrease by approximately $400 million based on those assumptions. And then when you include the repatriation tax to transition to the Territorial system, the savings would be $350 million. Phil Gresh : Okay. So just to clarify. If we're looking at your CFO year-over-year, it would be the $350 million number. Joe Gorder : That would be correct. Phil Gresh : Okay. Great. Thanks. Second question is just on the OpEx. In the fourth quarter, you came in well below your expectations, and then in the first quarter your guidance is quite a bit higher. I mean, is that just simply nat gas cost and throughput? Or anything else that would stick out in terms of why you were so much better in the fourth quarter and the slip in 1Q?  It's Philip Lane. Primarily the difference between our turnaround activity from fourth to first quarter. Phil Gresh : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Paul Sankey : Good morning, all. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Paul. Paul Sankey : Back to the dead horse, I'm afraid, Joe. I'm just wondering if you can revisit the possibility of paying down debts. I know there's possibly the argument that it would lower your cost of capital and keep your multiple expanding, which it seems to be doing. And I guess that follows into the second part of my question, which is to where do you think we are relative to mid-cycle. I kind of think that's the answer on whether or not you should be thinking about doing more debt paydown and maybe less buyback. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Okay, Paul. So, you want to start with the second part of this first? Lane Riggs : Yeah, so I think, in terms of where we are relative to mid-cycle. When you start the year 30 million barrels below on distillate inventory, the distillate market looks very strong. And I think where we have been relative to mid-cycle, we've been below mid-cycle largely because the diesel cracks have been softer. I think you'll see significant strengthening in the diesel cracks, and you'll begin to pull above mid-cycle margins as we move through the year. Joe Gorder : And, Mike? Do you want to talk about debt? Mike Ciskowski : I guess on the debt we're at 23 percent debt-to-cap which is the low end of our range. And so, we don't have a lot of maturities upcoming. None so far in 2018. And so, I guess I just really hadn't thought much about paying debt down at this time. Paul Sankey : That's very clear, guys. Can I just go back to the mid-cycle? Sorry, were you saying that you think we're above mid-cycle right now? Joe Gorder : I think we have been below mid-cycle, but you'll start to transition to a period where we'll be above mid-cycle moving forward. Paul Sankey : Yeah, okay. As I said, it's kind of a follow up. Thanks very much, guys. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line Your line is now open. Joe Gorder : Benny, are you there? Benny Wong : Hi, guys. Sorry about that. Just figuring out how to use the phone still, I guess. Hi, guys. Hi, Joe. Joe Gorder : Hey. Benny Wong : Quick question for you. I guess this is more on the regulatory front, so this might be for Jason here. Just in regards to the CAFE standards that are coming up to going through the mid-term review. I think you're expected to have an outcome in April. Just wondering if there is any thoughts of anything you guys are looking for coming out of that? And if you see any efforts - if there are any efforts to roll back efficiencies, would that be held up if California doesn't want to get on side? Jason Fraser : Okay. This is Jason. We're of course happy that Trump has reopened that midterm evaluation. The EPA I think is going to meet that April 1st deadline. The administrator is very firm on meeting these obligations. So, we think there is obligation to lay in it. We understand they've been having productive conversations with Memphis and California. Everyone would prefer to have one national program. All those certainly prefer that. And I think the EPA's trying to work with what they can. We did see -- it looked like the majority of the autos had used credits from past years to meet the EPA standard for 2016. So that tells you that this is something that definitely needs to be looked at, these ever-increasing numbers. If we're starting to have trouble at 2016, I believe the EPA said that they would have enough credits to keep themselves open until 2021. So, we're hoping this process will end with some levelling off of the standards as a reasonable number, but the market allows you to sell cars that people actually want and is sustainable. Joe Gorder : Well, it's encouraging that they're allowing the midterm review to be completed. I mean, the previous administration aborted the process kind of in mid-stream and the fact that you're reassessing it, it shows that the autos are doing a good job of communicating their situation to the EPA and the other regulatory bodies. So, it will be interesting to see what happens. And this conversation on CAFE dovetails into the conversation around octane and the comments that Blake made earlier. So, it's an issue that needs to be resolved, and it needs to be resolved in a reasonable way unless we're going to start dictating to US consumers what it is that they can buy. Benny Wong : Great. Appreciate the color. And just in regards to the Appalachian unit, just wondering how much did the new tax environment impact that decision, if any? And if there's any projects in your portfolio that maybe weren't that attractive before that may be a little more interesting now in the new environment? Joe Gorder : So, the octane, it wasn't like it was on the fence with respect to our hurdle rates. Again, we use hurdle rates primarily as a way to focus the organization on - we first start with a strategic view and then we look at these projects in the context of our strategic view, and we use these hurdle rates to kind of get us to ensure that we at least minimize our commodity risk involved. So that's the long answer to say, no, the tax regulation didn't change how we were going to think about the Appalachian unit. And that same answer sort of pertains to how we view strategic investment in general. So, it remains to be seen. I'm not - I think, again, we've said time and time again we'll use our free cash flow to go through our asset allocation model and we'll just see how it all works out. Benny Wong : Great. Thanks, guys. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Benny. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Good morning, team. Joe Gorder : Hi, Neil. Neil Mehta : Hey, Joe. A question - and again, I asked you this a couple weeks ago but I'm still trying to get my head around it. I'm trying to figure out what the new normal is for Brent WTI. Now, obviously it's a fluid number and we'll blow through it on the way up and the way down, but we try to frame these things in terms of transportation economics usually. So how do you guys think about, when you think about the outcomes for like a normalized Brent WTI spread, what are the lags from an economic standpoint that kind of frame what you guys think of as a new normal? Gary Simmons : Hey, Neil. This is Gary. The way we look at it is that with incremental production coming online in the Permian and in the Cushing region, you're beginning to push the logistics assets getting to the Gulf. And so, you're really looking at a spot or walk up tariff which, today, is $3.00 to $3.50 to get to the Gulf. And then a Cushing barrel, or a DSW barrel, when it gets to the Gulf generally has about $1.00 quality differential. So that moves you from this $3.00 to $4.00, $4.50 and then you have about another $0.50 to get it on the water. So, we kind of viewed it anywhere in this $4.50 to $5.00 range is kind of what we believe is a sustainable Brent TI spread. Neil Mehta : Yeah, we were getting to a similar outcome. One question we had was around just once you get to the water, are there any limitations around crude export capacity or constraints just logistically? Just curious as people who are doing it whether you see any, especially if the US continues to grow at this pace over the next couple of years, do we run into a wall at some point? Joe Gorder : Well, we may at some point. I don't think we feel like the logistics are limiting today. What you do see, even with the ARP where it is today, you start to see people charge higher and higher premiums for dock access. So today that $0.50 number I quoted is more like $0.90 cents if you want to get to the water as people see the wide ARPs. Neil Mehta : Thanks, guys. Joe Gorder : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Chi Chow : Thanks. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi, Chi. Chi Chow : Hi. Regarding product export, it looks like you guys are still going pretty strong in the fourth quarter there. But do you see any risk ahead out of the Gulf Coast? For instance, do you expect the market to change at all with reports of PMX really progressing on sorting out its own operations? Gary Simmons : Chi, this is Gary. I don't think we see anything that's significantly different in terms of Mexico or South America. One, we think it's going to take PMX longer to get the improvement in refinery utilization than the numbers that they're quoting but then you're also seeing good demand growth. So even if refinery utilization improves, we think that demand growth will outweigh that improvement refinery utilization and we'll still see strong export demand into those regions. Chi Chow : Okay. Great. Thanks, Gary. And then on the Mexico strategy, a couple questions. What's the term on the agreements you have with IEnova on the three terminals and also for Fairmax on the rail services? Joe Gorder : It's 20 years on the Fairmax and it's less than that on the IEnova so it's half that. We have the option to extend these contracts. Chi Chow : Okay. Great. And do you see any risk to the momentum on energy reform down there on what might transpire from the upcoming presidential election? Joe Gorder : Yeah, I mean, we're watching it pretty carefully. We don't know any better than anybody else what might be the potential outcome of their election. I did read, though, this morning that there hasn't been a direct statement by the opposition party that they would undo the reforms and if there was an attempt to try to do that, it would be very difficult to execute. So, Jason, do you have any other color on that? Jason Fraser : That's right, Joe. The elections are coming up July 1. It is a big election in Mexico. The concern you see voiced most is about Mr. Lopez Obrador's views on energy reforms, the policies in favor of them. And we have always been told it's very, very hard to undo these now that they're in place. It's basically does change their constitution. And we think people - and there was a lot of short-term pain when this first started getting rolled out, but we are confident people will figure out this is really the best long-term interest of the Mexican economy that he's going to prevail. Chi Chow : Do you think Lopez's comments are just campaign rhetoric or do they actually believe some of the statements he's put out there? Jason Fraser : Gee, we don't know. Joe Gorder : It's hard to tell. Jason Fraser : We don't know. Chi Chow : Okay. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Chi. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kristina Kazarian with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kristina Kazarian : Hi, guys. Joe Gorder : Morning. Kristina Kazarian : A number of the pipeline companies have talked about building pipes from Permian to Corpus. Could you maybe talk about your thoughts about potentially committing to long-term capacity on a pipe like this given your refining footprint now in the Gulf Coast and maybe even potentially partnering with one of those companies to take an ownership stake in one of those pipes and how you think about something like that? Joe Gorder : Sure. Kristina, this is Rich. Currently, there's a lot of open season projects going on right now Epic and, Buckeye and Magellan have got projects going on from the Permian to Corpus or to Houston. We don't have any binding commitments with anybody. I mean you know us we're always looking at logistics opportunities that can reduce our secondary cost or provide third-party revenues, but it's interesting. But we're not committed to anything. Kristina Kazarian : Okay. And does that mean lack of interest at this point or just haven't decided on since there are so many options? Joe Gorder : There's a lot of options, and we're just - we're looking at them. The good news is, right, that's just going to mean there's more crude coming into Corpus for the Corpus refinery. So that's always a good thing when there's excess pipeline capacity coming into the markets where we can grow our refining capacity. Jason Fraser : Well, there's not a lack of interest on our part. Joe Gorder : Right. Jason Fraser : I mean, you just evaluate your options against the other options and what benefit it brings to not only DLP but also to Valero Energy, so we'll continue to look at them. But I think Rich's point is we're looking at them, but we haven't made any commitments today. Kristina Kazarian : Okay. And then a longer term one maybe on the other side of some of the questions you guys asked earlier around M&A, with a lot more capital in the refining space, do you think there is chance that you see other bidders out there in the market that might make you guys think about potentially considering selling some noncore assets, if you were to get increased interest across the space? Jason Fraser : Well, we don\u2019t have any noncore assets. Okay? So that\u2019s the first part of that. I would say you may see more M&A activity as a result of this, but we also talked earlier about bid-ask spreads being very high. I would suspect that it wouldn\u2019t take long for a seller to figure out that he could extract a premium, based on everyone\u2019s new situation under tax reform. And so, the prices will adjust. So, we can probably work ourselves into a thesis that said there\u2019s going to be a lot more activity, but buyers and sellers are both aware of the same facts, and so I don\u2019t know that a whole lot\u2019s going to change at the end of the day. Kristina Kazarian : All right. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ryan Todd : Good. Thanks, guys. Maybe a couple quick specific ones. Can you share your thoughts on what you think the status is of the biofuel tax credit extension? Whether you made any assumption on its inclusion or exclusion in your numbers? And whether it would offer upside to the $350 million pro forma or theoretical tax savings for 2017? Joe Gorder : Jason, you or Martin want to talk about it? Jason Fraser : Yes. He\u2019s just saying it would create upside. Are we going to get it? And would it create upside. Gary Simmons : Yeah, I mean, we do think the legislation that would bring the blended tax credit out has just been called up and delayed in the government funding immigration situation. We do expect it to be passed retroactive for 2017 and extended through 2018. At the end of the day, it's just got caught up in all the Washington drama right now. We don't think it's going to get changed to a producer\u2019s tax credit. That may be something that\u2019s revisited going forward, but everybody involved seems to see with everything going on. They just need to try to keep the current wall and get that passed for these two years and look at talking about subsequently changing it on out into 2019. So, we think it's going to happen. It's just a question of when. Ryan Todd : And then its value to us? Joe Gorder : It\u2019s of significant value to us for the JV. It\u2019s $1.00 a gallon retroactive, right? So, it\u2019s $160 million. So, it\u2019s significant. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thanks. And then maybe one other specific one. There\u2019s been quite a bit of recent weakness in fuel oil spreads, particularly on the high sulfur fuel oil spreads recently even above and beyond what I guess we would expect seasonally. Can you speak to the way you think the drivers is of that? Is it a function of fundamentals? Is it a front-running of the IMO trade? Or too early for that? Or any thoughts around that? And then your potential to potentially capitalize on lower feed stock costs? Joe Gorder : Yes, I think it\u2019s probably too early for any of the IMO impact to be seen in the market. I think what you\u2019re seeing, though, is globally countries are beginning to put in infrastructure to able to import LNG, and then they ban the burning of high sulfur fuel for power generation. And so, you\u2019ve seen that transpire in a couple countries, and as those countries roll off and stop consuming fuel, you see weakness in the markets. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen recently happen in the market. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thanks. And is this something you can capitalize on within the portfolio? Or relatively insignificant in the scheme of things? Joe Gorder : No, it very much is. High sulfur fuel oil has a significant input, impact on the heavy sour crude prices. And so as high sulfur fuel gets discounted, we generally see wider quality discounts which benefit us greatly. Ryan Todd : Okay. Great. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude Q&A for today. I\u2019d like to return the call to Mr. John Locke for any closing remarks. John Locke : Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call. If you have any additional questions or didn\u2019t get a chance to ask, please just give us a call at the Investor Relations team. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2018 Valero Energy Corp. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. John Locke. Sir, you may begin. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning. Welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We started the year with bullish fundamentals, healthy product demand and days of supply for total light products below the five-year range. However, as the quarter progressed, winter storms, fog along the Gulf Coast and strong refinery utilization delayed seasonal product draws, creating some margin headwinds. But despite these challenges, Valero performed well and delivered solid financial results. As you know, we've been investing growth capital in logistics projects. An excellent example of this is the Diamond Pipeline, which is running well and enabling us to capture additional margin into our refining system. We increased pipeline throughput during the quarter, which provided our Memphis refinery with greater access to Cushing and Midland crudes that are cost advantage versus LLS. We made additional investments in logistics to further reduce secondary costs and increase margin capture. We acquired the SemLogistics Milford Haven fuel storage facility in Wales. We also entered into a joint ownership agreement with Sunrise Pipeline LLC, a new pipeline connecting Midland and Wichita Falls, Texas. Construction also continues on the Central Texas pipelines and terminals and the Pasadena products terminal. We expect these investments to improve flexibility in product and feedstock supply in our refineries when completed in 2019 and 2020. Turning to our refining investments. Work remains on track for the Diamond Green Diesel capacity expansion and the Houston and St. Charles alkylation units. These projects should start up between the third quarter of this year and 2020. In addition, our board of directors approved the construction of a 45-megawatt cogeneration plant at the Pembroke refinery. We expect to see lower operating costs and improved electricity and steam supply reliability when the project is completed in 2020. Turning to cash returns to stockholders. We paid out 57% of our first quarter adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. And we continue to target an annual payout ratio of between 40% to 50%. In closing, we remain optimistic about the margin environment for the year. Global economies are growing. Product demand is strong, particularly in Latin America. And days of supply refine light product inventories are below five-year averages. With our highly reliable and flexible refining system, we are well positioned to capture margin tailwinds arising from these positive trends. And with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you, Joe. For the first quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $469 million or $1.09 per share compared to $305 million or $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $431 million or $1 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany this release. Operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2018 was $922 million compared to $640 million for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding $170-million benefit from the retroactive Blender's Tax Credit and $10 million of expenses, primarily related to ongoing repairs at certain of our refineries to address damage resulting from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and other increment weather conditions the first quarter of 2018, operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $762 million. The increase from 2017 is attributed primarily to higher distillate margins, which were partially offset by narrower discounts for medium and heavy sour crudes versus Brent. Refinery throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 93,000 barrels per day higher than the first quarter of 2017. Throughput capacity utilization was 94% in the first quarter of 2018. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.78 per barrel were $0.09 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2017, mainly due to higher throughput in the first quarter of 2018. The ethanol segment generated $45 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $22 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 was primarily due to stronger distillers grain prices. Operating income for the VLP segment in the first quarter of 2018 was $84 million compared to $70 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 was attributed mainly to contributions from the Port Arthur terminal assets and Parkway Pipeline, which were acquired in November of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, general and administrative expenses were $238 million and net interest expense was $121 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $498 million and the effective tax rate, excluding the retroactive Blender's Tax Credit, was 22% in the first quarter of 2018. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter-end, total debt was $9 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.7 billion, of which $71 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 24%. At the end of March, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $750 million was available for only VLP. We generated $138 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter. Included in this amount is a $1.1-billion use of cash to fund working capital. Excluding working capital, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 1.2 billion. Moving to investing activities. We made $631 million of growth and sustaining capital investments, of which $448 million was for expenditures to sustain the business, including $220 million for turnaround and catalyst costs. The balance of capital invested in the quarter was for growth. With regard to financing activities. We returned $665 million to our stockholders in the first quarter. $345 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 3.5 million shares of Valero common stock. As of March 31, we have approximately $3.5 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Capital investments for 2018 are expected to total $2.7 billion with about $1.7 billion allocated to sustaining the business and $1 billion to growth. Included in the total are turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.61 million to 1.66 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 460,000 to 480,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 280,000 to 300,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 355,000 to 375,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $3.85 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of four million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For 2018, we continue to expect the annual effective tax rate to be about 22%. For the second quarter, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $180 million. Net interest expense is estimated at $120 million. And total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $520 million. Lastly, we expect RINs expense for the year to be between $500 million and $600 million, which is approximately $200 million lower than previous guidance, primarily due to lower RINs prices. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we will again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Good morning, everybody. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Hey. So, first I want to say congratulations to Mike and that I've enjoyed working with you over the years and good luck in the future, first of all. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Doug. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : You're welcome. And my question is on IMO 2020 and specifically how you guys are thinking about the type of products that are likely to be provided to the market as it seems that many fuels are still in the design phase and there's a lot of uncertainty in that area. And on marine fuel blends, how challenging the issues of compatibility, stability and availability of supply along these marine fuel networks are likely to be as the market goes through the transition in coming years? So two questions on IMO 2020. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Doug. This is Gary. I think I'll start with the latter part of it. I think you really hit the nail on the head in terms of the challenges on IMO and the fuel quality. A lot of these blends, it's about stability of the fuel. And so we're certainly doing a lot of work in that area to understand some of these blends and things that can be done to be able to produce the 0.5-way percent (13:05) spec. But because a lot of those challenges, certainly the industry today is pointing more towards a lot more ULSD in the marine bunker business and that's the reason; it's the stability of the fuel. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay, thank you. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks Doug. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Market. Your line is now open. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning everyone. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Brad. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Joe, on the repurchase front. Obviously, the stock's up almost 70% over the past year. At some point, is there a change in the calculation there where some of the cash looks more attracted to M&A or maybe to the dividend or some other use rather than the repurchase, or is it truly just a flywheel for excess capital? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: No, it's the latter. And the capital allocation framework we've used now for several years just remains in place. We'll continue to invest for growth. We will continue to maintain our commitment to the dividend. And we'll use surplus cash for share repurchases. That being said, if we saw a transaction out there that we thought was excellent and that provided synergies for the company, we wouldn't hesitate to approach it. But that's been part of the model, the framework now for several years. So I don't expect anything really to change going forward. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe, for Gary I'll ask another IMO question. Obviously, we're all consumed with all the positive potential benefits from that. Are there any offsets that you guys are thinking about, I'm particularly thinking about if industry runs (14:56) move up a lot in order to meet the distillate side of the equation, are we going to see weakness in gasoline? But any other thoughts along those lines will be helpful. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: No, I think that we're \u2013 we actually feel that IMO will be supportive of gasoline cracks as well, and the reason for that is a lot of the low-sulfur feedstocks that are going to cat crackers today to produce gasoline, you want to pull those in to make the low-sulfur marine bunker roll stack (15:23). So I think overall, IMO is very supportive to both gasoline and distillate. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks all. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning team. I just wanted to start with a big thank you to Cisko. You came into the role 15 years ago. We looked this morning, the stock is up 1,300%, over 4x the market before even looking at the dividends. We know the ride hasn't been linear, but it has been a great one and we appreciate your steady hand at the helm of a financial shift. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: So, Neal, Donna has got a high bar to jump over... Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Well, the questions I had here were all in the crude differential because you guys have unique perspective on this. And first one I'll start on the light side. So we've seen WTI Midland really widen out here in 2018, you guys have a good perspective on this, especially now with your involvement with Sunrise and with very new \u2013 a few new pipelines coming into, let's call it, the back half of 2019. There's investor concern, certainly, on the producer side that these differentials really could widen out towards trucking economics. So I want to get your perspective on what's going on in the Midland? Is there sufficient trucks to ultimately move the crude from West Texas down from to the refining centers at Corpus Christi? Are there constraints, and how does this all kind of play out? And then I have a follow-up on the heavy side. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey, Neil, this is Gary. I think when you look at kind of what's happened to the Midland market over the last six months, November we had the enterprise, the Midland-to-Sealy pipeline come on with 450,000 barrels a day of takeaway capacity. As that started up, the Midland Cushing spread came in fairly narrow and then we continue to see production ramp-up, which as the production ramped up pretty much all the pipeline capacity at either Cushing or to the Gulf Coast was again being consumed. And then in the first quarter, I think, to compound all that, you had some refinery maintenance in the Mid-Continent. And so some of the demand for some of those Midland barrels that's typically there went away and so the Midland Cushing spread really widen out. I think we see \u2013 what we see is that as refining capacity comes back on in the Mid-Continent, that Midland Cushing spread will come back in some. But as you get out later this year and early into 2019, it does look like once again production will ramp up to the point where logistics will be a limit and we'll be in for a period where that Midland Cushing spread will be relatively wide until the next pipeline project come online. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And do you have a view, Gary, in terms of how much it will cost to truck crude from West Texas down to the Gulf Cost assuming that is the marginal barrel? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: We did a little bit of that when the differential blew out several years ago, and I don't remember what the numbers are, Neil. But it's expensive to move by truck. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Great. And a follow-up question on the heavy side. We've seen this Canadian differentials tighten up here. It's going to be a big turnaround season in May and June. But production looks like it going to keep on ramping towards the end of year. So just thoughts on Western Canada? And then also LLS Maya, which has increased despite some of these Venezuela issues would be helpful. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. I'll start in Canada. Yeah, I think we saw Canadian differentials really blow out and then have since come in some. We had the Fort Hills production come online. And so increase in production you were definitely limited on the logistics to be able to clear the barrel. Some of it was the increase in production, but we also had \u2013 Keystone had a pressure restriction, which de-rated that line. And then, a lot of issues around the rail, both weather-related issues around rail and also the lack of locomotives. So then as we moved further in the quarter, we saw some seasonal maintenance being \u2013 occurring up in Western Canada, which lowered production. At the same time, Keystone was able to restore their capacity. We've seen some improvement in the rail. So those differentials have come back in some. But ultimately, I think, we view that production in Western Canada will outpace the ability to clear that barrel until one of the cross-border pipelines comes one, which is more a 2020 discussion. I think you'll see relatively wide discounts in Western Canada on those barrels. At the Maya LLS, I think when you look at Maya and the Maya formula, a lot of the components of the Maya formula contributed to Maya moving weaker. WTS moved weaker. Fuel oil moved weaker. And the Brent TI are (20:10) widening out all contributed to Maya moving weaker. And certainly, they can correct that with adjustments to the K, but what we saw in the first quarter was a lot of their demand was down due to U.S. Gulf Coast refinery maintenance. And so they were actually low in production. And within being at a position of having length I think they were reluctant to change the K. And so we saw Maya very competitively priced during the quarter. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Appreciate the insights, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Neil. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: First I want to really say congratulations to Mike, and wish you a wonderful time on the retirement. But are you sure that you're so young that you want to retire? What are you going to do with all the time? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, thanks, Paul. I think it's probably a little late for that. But yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Has been a fun ride for all this year that I was not following the sector as long as you have been in the sector, but has been a fun ride. So, thank you for all the help throughout the decades. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: You're welcome. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I guess, I have two question. First for Gary. It seems that people are talking about the IMO 2020. I'm just curious that have you guys heard anything related to the low sulfur (21:39), would that have any unexpected consequences in terms of the machine how they're going to run and all that, (21:47)? And also that have you heard any \u2013 because I heard someone talking about a cheaper new technology may be able to directly convert the high sulfur we see into the low sulfur (21:56) bunker fuel without going through the hydrocracker or the cooking technology. Wondering if you heard anything about that. So that's the first question. Second question then how much is the Midland crude you currently will be able to run in McKee and the rest of your system? And that \u2013 how much more that you think you may be able to get for the pipeline if said (22:22) you have any additional arrangement? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. I'll start. So, I think your first question was the impact that running a lower sulfur fuel may have on the ships' engines. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's correct. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: I think that we see a lot of the ships today when they get into these areas next to the shoreline are burning diesel anyway, and so they have some history on burning low sulfur fuels and I'm not aware of any negative impact that had on engine wear. The second part of that question in terms of technology to convert resid to low sulfur (22:56) I'll let Lane answer. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. I mean, I guess our view is at grassroots was pretty expensive to do. I mean somebody had to go out and try to build something like this and just some where you have to have all the infrastructure. So one of these looks a whole lot like maybe it's not a resid cracker but it's a resid hydro trigger, we have some experience with those. Their best use would be put into an existing refinery. I don't know if anybody is seriously looking at this at this time. I hear a lot talk about it, but I guess I'll leave it at that. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, you are a bit skeptical about the claim that this brand \u2013 I mean, I heard someone talking about this brand-new technology may be much cheaper, a quarter of the corresponding hydrocracking solution. So just curious that you guys have any thought on that. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. I think, what I would say is skepticism is maybe overstating it a bit. I'm just saying, no matter what, it would be pretty expensive and it would have to be a refiner that would probably have to be able to do this. And I think everybody wants to \u2013 I think people want to see the market evolve before they commit that much money, particularly to a new technology that people aren't familiar with. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Very good. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Then on your Midland question, I guess all \u2013 really our capacity to run Midland is we could run as much Midland \u2013 1.6 million barrels a day of light sweet capacity we have could be all Midland. I'm sure, what you are getting at is how much of that could we get is actually priced at Midland type values. Today, a lot of the crude we run at Ardmore and McKee is priced off of Midland. We don't divulge the number and some of the reasons for that is that pricing contracts are negotiable and up all the time, so that number flows a little bit. But we run a lot of Midland priced crude at both McKee and Ardmore. And then, we recently announced the Sunrise project, which will give us another 100,000 barrels a day of Midland priced crude that we can take into Ardmore and McKee. And in addition to that, we're certainly looking at all these pipeline projects from the Permian to the Gulf and evaluating opportunities to get more Midland priced crude, both to our Gulf Coast system and to the export refineries. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Gary, when is Sunrise is up and running will be? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: First quarter of 2019? Yeah, first quarter of 2019. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Thank you very much. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning. And Mike enjoy it. You won't have to listen to us Wall Streeters too much anymore. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Sounds great. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I might have detected a little too much enthusiasm in that response. Hey, shifting gears a little bit here, guys, crude's been running up, wholesale price has been moving up, cracks look good. First time in several years, we're looking at retail gasoline closing in on $3. What is your thought on where we might see a demand response and kind of how do you \u2013 what experience gives you maybe that confidence? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: You know Roger, I don't know that we have an exact number. We certainly haven't seen a negative reaction to the Street price yet in terms of the demand response. And our view has always been certainly where crude got to be over $100 a barrel there was certainly demand destruction that took place there. But somewhere I think between that $80 and $100 range is when you start to see some demand destruction start to take place if crude gets that high. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: It's always muted though. I mean, if you look at what's really happened and you look at type of vehicles that are being purchased today, I think Ford has announced that they're not going to make cars \u2013 so many cars anymore. And it's because of the demand for light trucks and SUVs. So Roger, from a practical standpoint, even with the higher price, it's going to be difficult for people to moderate their consumption that much based on the vehicles that they're buying today. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Absolutely. Just always good to get somebody who has got their hands a little closer to it than the rest of us. The other question I had, Latin America has been a nice area for margin growth, market share growth for you. I was just curious, Venezuela from a refining standpoint is, I guess, now finally shut down. What beyond them backing out of the market have you seen in growth? In other words, what do you think is probably a true growth rate out of Latin America that we should think about maybe more from this point forward, given that I guess you'd call it a normalized activity level from refining in Latin America from this point forward? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Roger, I don't know if I can give you an absolute number. We can get with you with John to give you what that figure is. But the way we look at it is we kind of looked at a reasonable ramp-up and refinery utilization rate, and we're confident that demand growth in the region outpaces any kind of a reasonable ramp up in refinery utilization is kind of the way we've looked at that market. But in terms of absolute growth, I'm not sure I can give you a number what we've planned on. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you so much guys for taking my question. My first question is last year Pemex did approach you for possible help with fixing their assets and offered a percentage ownership. You did decline the offer. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw in those refineries because of which you decided not to go ahead with it? And second one is I may be wrong on this, but you have a coker project at Port Arthur. Can you just add some more color about it? I'm not looking for an EBITDA guidance, but generally some specifics around the project? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. So, Manav, let's go ahead, and I'll let Lane talk a little bit about \u2013 and it's not specific just to Mexico, but it's specific to what it would take to turn around a challenged refinery, because we have tons of experience with that. So Lane, you want to share your thoughts? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. So to Joe's point, I mean really all of Latin America has some more or less exposure to the sort of having a lack of, I would say, maintenance capital. So over time their operations and their reliability have eroded, largely probably because of the flat price in crude. They can't really fund \u2013 they can't fund their operations. And so depending on how long and how deep that sort of that story goes, it takes a long time to recover. I mean, like some conversations that we've had \u2013 some of these counterparties in the past was it's at least two turnaround cycles. And you really have to \u2013 you have to stare at your management a long time. And there's a lot of work involved in this. And a lot of times, if you think about two turnaround cycles, whether that's 6 years or 10 years, that typically out \u2013 that sort of is a longer duration than a lot of the sort of the political types or certainly the \u2013 even some of the management involved in trying to get this done. So it's a very, very, very difficult thing to turn around a refining complex when it's gotten in states that many of these Latin American refineries are in. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: On coker. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Oh I'm sorry. (30:49) Port Arthur coker, we're still working with all the sort of the stakeholders in Port Arthur community along with the TCEQ (30:55) to get that permit move forward. We fully expect to get a permit sometime this year on it. Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you so much guys. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks guys. I just wanted to get your view. One of the things being proposed is making higher octane level in gasoline a standard in the U.S. and \u2013 as a potential replacement for the RFS. Just wondering if you could share your views on the merits of that proposal and any color on how it's being received by the other side, and what you think is maybe the sticking points of making it happen. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. So why don't we let Jason talk about maybe the process here a little bit. And then if Gary or Lane want to talk about what it takes, that'd be great. Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Benny, this is Jason. And you're right. That is something that's being talked about in the context of the legislative long-term reform of the RFS moving to high efficiency high octane fuel standard. And (31:59) working on this with the autos for around a year now. And the conversations have expanded recently to include the retailers in ethanol. And we do think this will be a win all around for everybody. It helped the autos by \u2013 enable them to make more efficient vehicles. So it can hit the CAFE standards easier. It'd be a win for ethanol because ethanol is an excellent low cost source of octane. So an increased demand for ethanol. And we would all benefit making internal combustion engine more competitive longer term against (32:29). So we do think it's something that needs to be looked at. Unknown Speaker : (32:35) gasoline blending to get there? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Well \u2013 so, this is Lane. From a gasoline blending perspective, clean high octane components like alkylate help in this process. They help dilute out some of the other sort of aromatic-based octane that are in the gasoline pool. And like Jason alluded to, it will require a certain amount of ethanol. I mean, the industry has gotten used to ethanol in the blends and it is a source of octane. And so that definitely is going to be a part of the blend. I think on balance, what you have to deal with is the light naphtha. Some light naphtha \u2013 assuming (33:10) are full is going to have to find its way somewhere else, whether it goes into the olefins \u2013 the olefins crackers or somewhere else, but that's a stream that we'll \u2013 that the industry will be trying to fall between high octane components to blend it off and just getting it out of the pool. Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And do you guys have any color if ethanol or the corn side is open to this or they have any opposition? Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: This is Jason, again. I think they are still trying to get their arms around it. But the initial indications from some of the larger ethanol producers are they acknowledge kind of this 95 (33:45) type of level, or I think they call it 91 AKI, which is roughly equivalent to something that makes sense for the market. Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Appreciate that. And just if \u2013 I have a follow-up, if I may. And apologies if you guys have touched on it in your prepared remarks. Just \u2013 is there an update on the status of the Texas City Refinery? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: So, hi Benny, this is Lane. No, we haven't said anything yet. So I think I've talked to you last \u2013 I don't know, the Friday of the Valero Texas Open, but where we are based on the repair of the alky, we're going to bring forward to the FEC (34:24) alky turnaround that we had scheduled at Texas City this past fall, we're just bringing it forward, we want to execute it now. Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to turn the focus to the West Coast. So, this quarter you're in the black better 1Q performance than last year. And we did have some concerns in the market about West Coast operating conditions in general for the industry earlier in 1Q. So kind of wanted to get your thoughts on outlook for the remainder of the year. Maybe, addressing where we are now versus where I think the market might have been concerned about, maybe, a month or two ago. Does it seem like a turning point from last year and a stronger starting point? So I just want to sort of get a read dynamically how we should be thinking about those for rest of the year. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes, so I think what we saw on the West Coast is certainly the inventory draw we saw this week and getting below that 30 million-barrel threshold, I think, provided a lot of support for the market. Overall, we still believe that the West Coast has long refining capacity. And so as long as all the refineries are running at high utilization rates, the market really can't absorb all the production. But when the refinery goes down, you see spikes in the market and the market becomes short. I think longer term, the things I look to that can help that market is really the opening up and deregulation in Mexico. I think you will see exports from the West Coast that will go to the west side of Mexico. And then, you'll also see is some of the cross-border sales ramp up, in markets like El Paso you will start to see some more West Coast barrels serving the Arizona market which will help bring that market back into balance. Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just a quick question on \u2013 I think we've talked about this earlier, about the medium sour availability being a little bit more difficult in the current environment. Just wanted to get your sense or longer term thoughts in addressing that where there might be sourcing there or is that something that we should just be sort of expecting intermediate terms to still be a little bit scarcer? And then maybe coming back next year. Want to get your read dynamics on the market. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. So I think there's not a problem really with availability of medium sour crude product system. It's just not priced to where we show an economic incentive to maximize those barrels. However they are, certainly, inter-related. And I think we see that medium sours will continue to price at a level where we wouldn't expect to run a high-volume medium sour crude until the OPEC production comes back online, whenever that is, if it is later this year or early next year. But I think if the OPEC production comes back online and you get that additional supply in the market, you will see those medium discounts widen and we'll bring them back into our system. Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. Thanks very much for the time. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Prashant. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Justin Jenkins with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning everybody. I guess, I will start maybe with a corollary to Roger's gasoline question but more on the diesel front. You've got inventories as low as they've been since 2014 here in the U.S. and obviously IMO on the horizon. So if prices on diesel continue to move higher as maybe we'd all expect, does that start to impact the demand equation there and maybe even the broader economy, or how should we think about that one? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. I think we see diesel demand that's very strong. And as you mentioned, 28 million barrels below where we were last year, we had good heating oil demand with little colder weather in the Northeast. And then, we're seeing very strong rack (38:11) demand. I think some it's economic growth and then a lot of it is just the increase in the upstream activity. But the big thing to us is as we started to get out of typical heating well season you could see in the stats we actually had record exports. And we're seeing just overall what appears to be an overall global short of distillate barrels available. So I think we feel like that the distillate market is going to be \u2013 remain very strong throughout this year, and then you certainly \u2013 as you alluded to, we'll start to see an IMO impact that affects us on the distillate side as well. When that starts to kick in, I'm not sure. But we certainly feel that we're in for a very good year in terms of the diesel fundamentals. Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Perfect. Appreciate that. Maybe on the midstream side. Gary, you alluded to the potential for pipeline participation towards your Gulf Coast assets. But I'm curious, Joe or even Gary, how you think about getting closer to the wellhead in the Permian to gather crude and may be control that barrel further? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. So, I think, any of these projects that come couple of reasons. One is to lower our deliver cost of crude and then also it allows us better control online, Rich Lashway and my group certainly evaluate all of them. And it's for a couple of reasons. One, is to lower our delivery cost accrued, and then also it allows us better control over the quality of the barrel that we're running in our refining system. So for those reasons, we're involved in all these processes on the new lines coming on. And certainly look to participate if it makes sense for us to do so. Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is now open. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Hey, guys. Good morning. Mike, I will certainly miss the opportunity to catch up with you over in West Texas. It's been a good run and congrats to you man. Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Blake. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : I wanted to go back. I know you've kind of addressed, Gary, some of the, I guess, the mediums and likes, but a lot of the inbound questions we've been getting from clients recently has been on where we stand with regard to maxing out light sweet processing. I think you had mentioned to me last week that you're backing out mediums and going to max light sweet and heavy, but can you say \u2013 I mean, have you fully exhausted your capability of running light sweet at this point? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Pretty much, Blake. If you look at where we were in the first quarter, we said that we ended at 1.6 million barrels a day of light sweet crude processing capacity. Although it wasn't fully utilized, a lot of the capacity that wasn't used, it was because we had maintenance going on at a couple of our refineries that backed out some of that light sweet crude processing capacity. But we pretty much \u2013 our economic signals are pointing us to maximize light sweet pretty much everywhere we can. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Okay. The second question, your utilization rates along with the industry have been pretty well above what historical norms would suggest and above expectations. And I'm just curious if you have any thoughts around, maybe, what's driving that and the sustainability of that. Is that just kind of capacity creep maybe to where the nameplate numbers are a little bit stale, or is just reliability improving, or any thoughts you have there? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: I think when I go back and look at the trend in refinery utilization, some of it is tied to the trend in running lighter crude. So as the API \u2013 average API gravity of the crude slate has gone up throughout the industry, utilization has gone up with it. So we certainly see at some of our refineries, as we run a lighter diet, it enables us to run higher rates. So with that, you would expect that as the crude quality discounts widen and the slate gets heavier, maybe there's a chance utilization falls back off if that occurs. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Got it. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey \u2013 hey, Blake, I'll just add one other thing. I think one of the things you've seen over the last few years is different than maybe historically. So there's been a call on crude capacity signals, that's pretty much been the most economic unit in the refinery. So all refiners will do everything to make sure that capacity is always well utilized, feedstocks were in front of it. You might even incur demurrage to make sure that in fact you don't lose capacity. So, I mean, that's clearly been part of what's going on with respect to the utilization, because that number is the crude unit capacity. It's not buying intermediates and other things. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Blake. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First one is just on LLS discounts to Brent. We started to see those widen out a bit here this year, starting to creep higher towards the Houston side. And I presume some of that's DAPL and Diamond and the knock on effects. But just curious how you think about LLS discounts moving towards say relative to Houston? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Phil. I think to some degree, we're starting to view LLS as somewhat of a stranded crude marker. I think especially since we exited that market. When we started at the Diamond Pipeline, there's just not a lot of liquidity around LLS anymore. And so to us, the more relevant marker to look for the U.S. Gulf Coast light sweet is that MEH (43:24) marker. And that's the one we tend to look at more heavily than LLS. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. That makes sense. The second question is just around the California refining market. I want to get your latest thoughts on Wilmington and the hydrofluoric acid phase-out discussions. I know there's a committee meeting coming up this weekend. There are some slides published in advance of that meeting, talking about potentially phasing out HFA altogether, which I know would be a fairly costly endeavor. So I just want to get your viewpoint on this HFA phase out, particularly given the cost relative to the size of the refinery. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes. This is Lane. Hey. We just really continue to work with the community and the SCAQMD out there and then the other stakeholders really to arrive at what we think will ultimately be a reasonable solution. That's sort of what we've been stating in all the calls and all the conferences and that still what we believe. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So just to clarify, I mean, you wouldn't at this point say a phase out of HFA would be a nonstarter for you guys? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Say that again? Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : The idea that HFA would be phased out for sulfuric or some other solution, is that a non-starter from a cost perspective? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: It, well \u2013 it would absolutely \u2013 we're building an alkylation unit at our Houston refinery and at our St. Charles. And so you're talking about something on the order of $0.5 billion. If in fact we build the sulfuric acid and then that would be in California, so it would be probably even more. So it'll be a very, very, very expensive endeavor, if there was a short fuse on a phase-out in the West Coast. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Hey, guys. This is Clay (45:20) on for Doug. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of things have been touched here. So I just want to get your thoughts on Latin America. Obviously, the underperformance in that refining system has played a big role in creating the opportunity to ramp U.S. product exports. Just want to know what the prognosis is today, and if there are any upside risk to crude runs that you guys are watching out for. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: I don't think we see anything that causes us a pause for what we're doing in Latin America. We still see very good product demand pools (45:50) both for gasoline and distillate. I don't think we see anything on the horizon that's going to change that. Unknown Speaker : All right. Thanks guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Maybe a follow-up question. You addressed your view on overall kind of Canadian heavy and heavy differentials earlier. But can you talk about within your system and how much Canadian heavy are you able to run right now? What are the \u2013 I realize it's going to be difficult until the cross-border pipelines potentially in 2020, but are there any \u2013 is there any possibility of you being able to increase your heavy crude runs over the next couple years? And maybe are you seeing any impacts from falling Venezuelan volumes or have you still had a strong heavy availability in the Gulf? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. So in the quarter, we ran about 180,000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian, Ryan, and it's not really a limit in our system. It's more of an economic optimization. So we could run a lot more heavy Canadian if the economic signals pointed us in that direction. But it would be at the expense of some of the other Latin American grades, be it Venezuelan or Maya. Some of those grades we would push out if the Canadian was more economic. Follow-up, I guess, in Venezuela, we've certainly seen some issues with production and issues around logistics. But for the most part, the volumes we got for Venezuela in the first quarter were consistent with what our historical volumes have been. And we continue to see good value for those barrels versus our other heavy sour alternatives. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And maybe one follow-up on \u2013 it feels like we've talked about Latin America a lot today. But there is \u2013 Petrobras is obviously looking for partners into (47:51) some opening up of the markets there and partnerships in some of the refineries down there. Do you view that as a similar situation of what you're describing earlier with Pemex, or how do you view the potential opportunities out of the Brazilian market? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, this is Joe. I mean, we'll take a look. I think it's too early for us to answer your question as specifically as you asked it though. I mean, we just don't know yet. So I mean, just like many others I'm sure we'll just take a look and see what the opportunity looks like and see what we can do with it. And then, we'll let you know more about it later. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Joe. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning everyone. Maybe to circle back. I think it was Lane's comment, talking about how the crude tower has pretty much been the most economical part of the refinery today. So just looking at your Gulf Coast system, you've run about 1.44 (48:53) of crude, but you produce 1.84 (48:57) of products, even after the recent crude topper projects at Corpus and Houston. Is there any thought to adding more crude distillation capacity on the Gulf Coast? And what kind of economics are you seeing on those recent topper projects? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, this is Lane, again. The issue you have \u2013 there's a limit to how much you can run crude because at some point \u2013 or even build it out. When we put our two crude toppers on, we sized them such that they would match our downstream capability, particularly in diesel hydrotreating, so we wouldn't have to go out and try to market something that didn't meet the ULSD spec. And so I think when many people look at a crude unit project, they're going to have to \u2013 there's other units involved. We were \u2013 and the reason we were able to do that is because we were buying a number of intermediate feedstocks in lieu of crude. So that set the size. For us to go up a lot more in that space, we would have to invest in diesel hydrotreating and gasoline hydrotreating. What was the second part of your question? Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: What kind of returns are you seeing on the Corpus and Houston toppers? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: (50:13) can give you the specifics, they have been great projects. They've exceeded our funding decisions with respect to IRR. So They've been great projects for us. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. Seems like it. Second question is on product exports. So you reported 271,000 barrels per day of product exports. I think that was down quite a bit year-over-year. Was that due to higher ethanol blends in Brazil this year? And can you also provide a split between how much was gasoline and how much was diesel? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes. So we start with that. We did 73,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports and our diesel exports were 163,000 barrels a day. The year-over-year numbers are down fairly significantly, and there's a number of reasons for that. Joe alluded to weather issues in the Gulf, especially a lot of fog that prohibited us from exporting during the quarter. Also we had some refinery maintenance that limited production. But the biggest thing was really probably more the strength of the U.S. market. So we have the ability to put barrels on the water and for us during the quarter we actually saw a lot better value to take those barrels we're putting on the water to the Florida market, for instance, rather than the export market. So a lot of our dock capacity was consumed taking barrels like to the Florida market, waterborne markets in the U.S. rather than the export market. I don't think it's any indication of lack of demand it was just \u2013 we always view that as an economic optimization and we had better netbacks to send to other markets. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Craig. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I understand there is not really a governor or upper limit on share price as far as buyback considerations. But is there an upper limit of the cash holdings that could impact targeted payouts if attractive M&A really doesn't materialize over the next two to three years? And as a follow-up to that, can you opine on what you might see long-term in terms of industry consolidation in midstream versus refining? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay, Mike, do you want to do the first one? Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I mean, we continue to evaluate the cash flow uses and the allocation of the surplus cash flow. That has not changed. We continue to allocate it per capital allocation framework. Right now, our payout ratio is 40% to 50%. If cash were built significantly over the next several quarters, surely, we would have to look at that to see whether we need to adjust that payout ratio in absence of any type of M&A opportunity. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay, and Craig, on the second part of your question, it was the consolidation, whether it would be in refining or MLPs? Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: And which might come earlier, right. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, okay, this is purely an opinion, right. And I open it up to any members of the team if they want to comment also. But I just don't think there's going to be a significant amount of opportunity for consolidation on the refining side of the business from Valero's perspective, because we really like our portfolio today. We have an excellent portfolio. I mean, there's things that we could bolt onto it that would be nice to have. But as far as creating \u2013 needing to do a transaction to create a lot more critical mass, that's just not something that we need to do today. So opportunistically, we look at everything, but practically speaking, we don't feel we need to do anything. Now, could there be more consolidation? Sure. I think people are always looking for different ways to grow their businesses. And certainly, if you can create synergy by combining, it makes a lot of sense to do that. In the MLP space, I don't know. Rich, do you have a view? Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.: I would say that it would be a challenge to think of consolidation right now in the \u2013 the MLP market is everybody's kind of reassessing the access to the equity capital market. So it doesn't seem like that there would be a momentum for that to happen right now to let equity capital markets kind of gets figured out. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. I mean, that all makes sense. It just sounds like eventually the payout ratio is going to have to rise over time. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Oh yeah, well, the ratio might rise, but probably the target is going to stay somewhat consistent. You know the volatility that we historically had in this business, which we have done our best as a team to try to strip. And so you always want to be careful with the dividend and be sure that once you put it in place, that is our commitment to our owners and we're going to be sure we do everything we can to sustain that dividend. And so Mike \u2013 we don't have a particular targeted number because Mike and Donna always look at the forecasted cash, what the balances look like going forward. And we've told the market for several years now we're not going to hoard cash and we haven't. And so I think, Craig, you should just assume that if we find ourselves sitting on a pot full of cash that we're going to return it. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the thoughts. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's Q&A session. And I'd like to return the call to Mr. John Locke for any closing remarks. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Well, thanks, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Feel free to give the IR team a call if you have any additional questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Valero Energy Corporation's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. John Locke. Sir, you may begin. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning. Welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel and several other members of Valero's Senior Management team. If you've not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Now I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release which, in summary, says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. During the second quarter, we operated well and delivered solid financial results despite having turnarounds in our Gulf Coast and North Atlantic regions. We processed near record volumes of light sweet crude and we maximized heavy sour crude runs in our refineries as discounts widened to levels we haven't seen since 2014. We were positioned to take advantage of these discounts more fully due to our logistics investments including the Diamond Pipeline which enabled our Memphis refinery to capture additional margin from running WTI instead of LLS. And with relatively wide discounts for WTI versus Brent, our commitment on Enbridge Line 9B also provided meaningful margin benefits. Looking ahead, work continues to move forward as planned on the Central Texas pipelines and terminals and the Pasadena products terminal with completion expected in 2019 and 2020. We expect the Sunrise Pipeline expansion to start-up in early 2019 which will provide our Mid-Continent region with even greater access to cost advantage Permian crude. Turning to our refining investments, the Diamond Green Diesel capacity expansion is nearing completion and start-up is scheduled in August. Construction is also progressing on the Houston and St. Charles alkylation units and the Pembroke cogeneration plant. We expect these projects to be completed in 2019 and 2020. With regard to cash returns to stockholders, we paid out 51% of our year-to-date adjusted net cash provided by operating activities and we continue to target an annual payout ratio between 40% to 50%. Looking ahead, we continue to have an optimistic outlook for the balance of the year. Global economic activity remains healthy and product demand is strong domestically and internationally. Gasoline and distillate export volumes are steady. Days of supply of light products remain below five-year averages despite recent high industry refinery utilization rates. And while crude discounts have narrowed recently, the oil market remains well supplied and we expect differentials to widen again as the industry enters turnaround season. And with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you, Joe. For the second quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $845 million, or $1.96 per share, compared to $548 million, or $1.23 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Second quarter 2018 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $928 million, or $2.15 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany this release. Operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of 2018 was $1.4 billion compared to $945 million for the second quarter of 2017. Excluding $21 million of other operating expenses primarily related to costs associated with the fire at the Texas City Refinery in April, adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2018 was $463 million higher compared to the second quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 is mostly attributed to higher distillate margins and wider discounts for sour and domestic sweet crudes versus Brent, partly offset by lower gasoline margins. Refining throughput volumes in the second quarter of 2018 averaged 2.9 million barrels per day and throughput capacity utilization was 93%. Throughput volumes were 121,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter of 2017 due to maintenance in the U.S. Gulf Coast and North Atlantic regions. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.67 per barrel were $0.11 per barrel higher than the second quarter of 2017, mainly due to lower throughput in the second quarter of 2018. The ethanol segment generated $43 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $31 million in the second quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 was primarily due to higher distiller grains prices and stronger production volumes in the second quarter of 2018. Operating income for the VLP segment in the second quarter of 2018 was $83 million compared to $71 million in the second quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 was mostly attributed to contributions from the Port Arthur terminal assets and Parkway Pipeline, which were acquired in November of 2017. For the second quarter of 2018, general and administrative expenses were $248 million and net interest expense was $124 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $523 million and the effective tax rate was 22%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter-end, total debt was $9.1 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $4.5 billion, of which $100 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 24%. At the end of June, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $750 million was available for only VLP. We generated $2.1 billion of cash from operating activities in the second quarter. Included in this amount is $581 million benefit from working capital. Excluding working capital, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion. Moving to capital investments, which excludes acquisitions, we made $718 million of growth and sustaining investment in the second quarter. Included in the $510 million of sustaining expenditures was $270 million for turnaround and catalyst costs. The balance of capital invested in the quarter was for growth. With regard to financing activities, we returned $672 million to our stockholders in the second quarter. $345 million was paid as dividends, with the balance used to purchase 2.8 million shares of Valero common stock. As of June 30, we had approximately $3.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We completed a $750 million public debt offering in May, and in June we repaid $750 million of senior notes due in 2019. We continue to expect 2018 capital investments to total $2.7 billion, with about $1.7 billion allocated to sustaining the business and $1 billion to growth. Included in the total are turnarounds, catalysts, and joint venture investments. Now for modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.73 million to 1.78 million barrels per day, U.S. Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 270,000 to 290,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 445,000 to 465,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be approximately $4 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For 2018, we continue to expect the annual effective tax rate to be about 22%. For the third quarter, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $215 million. Net interest expense is estimated at $110 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $515 million. Lastly, we continue to expect RINs expense for the year to between $500 million and $600 million. That concludes our opening remarks. And before we open the call to questions, we would again respectfully request that our callers adhere to the protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits, as this will help us ensure all callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. How are you all? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I guess let's dive into the big question that's out there. Q2 was great. Q3 a year ago was really good. Q3 this year maybe doesn't look like it's starting off quite as strong, but if you can kind of walk us through maybe, Joe, how you see the market structure here as we look to the back half of the year. Maybe thoughts on turnarounds within the industry, where we are in terms of demand trends and then where you see, call it, crude access at this point given some of the issues out of nearby OPEC countries. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. Roger, that's great. We'll let Gary go ahead and take a whack at these. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Roger, I think you know on the diesel side, much like Joe commented in his opening remarks, demand remains very strong both domestically and to the export markets. Domestically, we're seeing about 125,000 barrels a day of demand growth. So despite the fact that we've had record high refinery utilization and distillate production that's above the five-year average range, we really haven't been able to replenish diesel inventories to pre-hurricane type levels. So we continue to see very low diesel inventories, very strong export demand and very strong domestic demand. So moving forward into the third quarter, I think you see some production fall off as we get into turnaround season and refineries come down for turnarounds. And then, of course, as you get later in the year, you'd expect to see some improvement in demand as heating oil season kicks in with some colder weather. So, to me, I think diesel should even be stronger in the prompt market, but when you look at the fundamentals, I think we're in for a very strong diesel year. On the gasoline side, again, gasoline demand looks good domestically and into the export markets. Here with the record-high refinery utilization and increase in gasoline production, gasoline production increases are outpacing the increases in demand a little bit, so we've been able to replenish gasoline inventories to kind of a pre-hurricane type level. As we move forward in the gasoline markets, like diesel, I think you'll see production fall off some with turnaround season. But assuming you don't have some interruption in supply like we saw last year with the hurricanes, I would expect gasoline to follow more seasonal trends, and once you get through driving season through Labor Day and demand falls off a little bit, you'll see gasoline cracks weaken as we get into the fourth quarter. On your crude question, we continue to see good availability in crudes despite declining production in Venezuela. We continue to get above our contract levels there. Seeing good supply from Canada. North American growth continues to exceed expectations and then we're starting to see more OPEC volume make its way to the United States as well. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So no problem on the crude side then? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: No. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Then just a quick follow-up. Guidance on cash OpEx if I understood was $4 a barrel. You've consistently done much better than $4 a barrel. So my question is simply, is there something going on expense wise? Or is this just closer to budget and if you perform better you come in lower on a per-barrel basis? John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. Roger, this is John. We take a view, right, as of a point in time and sometimes that changes over time. I think as you look at that number probably today, maybe there's \u2013 it's come off a little bit from there, but that is what the number is at the time we take the forecast. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So no major changes or anything that's changing sequentially, just part of the budgetary approach? John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Right. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. My question is; you recently made some acquisitions in Peru on the biodiesel side. I'm just trying to understand if you could give us some more color on that acquisition? And would the earnings of that new segment or whatever acquisition you have made go through in the refining segment or the ethanol business? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Good question. Rich, do you want to? Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, you bet. I'll answer this. So just to be clear, the acquisition here was not a renewable diesel acquisition. There's an idol renewable diesel plant there but it's been out of service for several years. This was really a wholesale marketing and terminal acquisition. We acquired two terminals that have in excess of 1.2 million barrels of storage, two truck racks, two offshore mooring facilities to offload product. So this is really set up to bring product into the country and not a renewable diesel play. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, it fits into our overall approach to securing shorts essentially in different international markets. We've got the activities that are taking place with Mexico, we've got now Peru, we've got other facilities that we're into today and we're looking at. But we've talked about being more involved in having access to the supply chain from the refineries out, and this acquisition just fits right into that. Essentially what we bought was a business, an operating business, and not a particular asset. So we feel pretty good about it, we also believe it's going to allow us to expand the business around that. We've got a team on the ground, obviously, right now working this, and their focus is, okay, we've got a strong market in Peru, where else are we going to take barrels that pass through this terminal. Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you so much, guys, for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I think this maybe is for Lane. Valero has continued to, seems like performing better and better in your refining operations. You've been consistently that I think outperform your throughput guidance even when you have some unplanned outages and all that, and that also seems like while you guys clearly are the leader here but the industry also doing better. Lane, when we're looking at fundamentally, is it good reason other than, say, the pricing is good so everyone trying to run hot. Is there any other reason why that we've been despite more environmental standard, one would think that more stringent standards would make it more difficult for the industry to maintain a high run rate. Is there anything fundamental has shift? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Paul, this is Lane. Could you repeat that last couple of sentences, please. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Well, I'm just trying to understand that, is it just because the commodity pricing is attractive so everyone is trying to run hotter, which is understandable. But other than that, is there anything fundamentally that make the industry be able to run their system much better than in the past? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: I think, generally, the industry has experienced through, whether it's through our shared understanding of via some things like Solomon, what good looks like and everybody's on their own individual journeys on how to get better in these spaces. And it's clearly been our focus to do that and we've improved our operation a great deal over the past 10 years, and we think we'll continue to improve. There's always room for improvement. But it's a focus to be safe and reliable, and obviously, environmentally compliant and all those things lend themselves to being a much more reliable operation. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Do you think that we have much more room to push on a sustainable basis to be better than what we have seen? I mean, it has been quite remarkable how well the industry has done. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. I'm not going to speak for the industry. I'll speak for Valero. Our real focus is to continue to minimize unplanned outages, and in particular to try to find ways to minimize our downtime, our turnaround downtime over an entire cycle, and make sure that our spend rates during that time is the right amount to achieve that. And that's really where we, in terms of going forward, that's where we see the most of our opportunity. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So you don't think that you max out yet? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: No. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Final one for me, Texas City, can you give us an update, the fire, when that is going to be back to normal operation? And also do you give any color about, I think previously talking about the coker investment? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: So, on the SCC question, the Texas City, the SCCs came back from current outlook, back to normal operation. The alkylation unit, we currently believe will sort of be mechanically restored at the end of August, so we'll resume full operation in the alky in early September. With respect to the coker, we're just still working through the permitting process with all the stakeholders. We have to ultimately have an operating permit, a construction and operating permit to go forward, and really even to get in the position to make the final FID decision. I mean, and that's just the way our gating process works, so that's where we are. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Pleasure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Morning, Joe. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning, Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Joe, you clearly are throwing off a great deal of cash, and obviously, we continue to admire the discipline at which you're returning cash to shareholders. So my question is kind of two-edged on that topic. And it is, why is 40% to 50% the right number? And given the substantial EBITDA you still hold at the parent company level, what's your latest thoughts on drop-down timing from an MLP standpoint? And I've got a macro follow-up, please. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Doug, good questions. Donna, you want to talk about the payout ratio. Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.: Sure. On the capital allocation perspective, we just believe that 40% to 50% is the right balance between returning to the shareholder via cash in the dividend and share buybacks, but also preserving some cash back at the parent to reinvest in the company, that being in the form of sustaining capital, but also growth opportunities and acquisition opportunities. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So just to be clear, I guess, on the MLP question, if you did do some additional drop-downs, what would be the priority for the use of that cash? And, I guess, what I'm really getting at is the balance between the dividend and the buyback, do you see that changing at some point? Because, obviously, a lot of your rerating has been driven by, I think anyway, the move towards being more of a yield stock within the S&P. I'm just wondering if you can see a little bit more of a pivot back towards the dividend away from the buyback. And I do still have a micro follow-up, please. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. No, Doug. I mean, good question. On the drop-downs, I mean, the reality is that Valero receiving cash back via drop-downs, just hasn't materialize the way we all expected it to, and that's because the capital markets just aren't there for MLP equities today. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: I think MLP debt is okay. But, essentially, the way it's working out is Valero is the financier for VLP. And so as far as the cash perspective goes, there is no windfall of cash to be achieved for Valero by dropping down assets to VLP. It's the way the market is today. Will the market be this way in six months? I don't know, okay, but that's the way it is today. So there's not a big windfall of cash, I would say, to be had because of a drop-down opportunity. We continue to look at the balance between the share repurchases and the dividend. And our basic view is let's get the dividend up to where we're paying out towards the high-end of the peer group, so that we're competitive there. And then, we use the share repurchases as a flywheel. The 40% to 50% range we give you is essentially our target. And to the extent that free cash flows exceed our expectations, we've used that flywheel than to go ahead and repurchase additional shares. And I think we're very comfortable with that and that's probably what we'll continue to do going forward. But rest assured that the dividend is something we talk about regularly. We are absolutely 100% committed to it. And whenever we make changes to it, we want to be sure that we're able to deal with it in good times and in bad times. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I appreciate the extended answer and, obviously, the arbitrage has closed some. So hopefully a quick follow up, Joe. I just wanted to close out the micro comments. It's an IMO question, I'm afraid, but there's obviously a great deal of uncertainty on how this is going to play out. And I just wanted to get your updated perspectives because it seems that bunker fuel associations and others around the world are starting to talk about what the real challenges are going to be of meeting the 1/1/20 date and particularly the pivot back towards scrubber options amongst other things. The example that's been cited is that delay of the water ballast rules that was pushed out two years because the industry was not ready. And I'm just curious if you've got a perspective as to how confident you are that things are going to transpire as optimistically, let's say, as some in the market are currently talking about. I'll leave it there. Thanks Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Doug, that's good, and we'll let Jason talk a little bit about IMO. Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, we've seen the same thing you have with a lot of discussion about how practical (25:19) implemented, whether the timeline's right. But at least our view now is we expect it to be implemented and enforced internationally according to there's timeline they put out without any big disruptions. The definitely hadn't made any indications to backing off at this time and if anything, they're working to put in place more effective enforcement mechanisms, like looking at whether you lose your insurance if you don't, it you violate the provisions or also potentially prohibiting vessels without scrubbers from transporting the higher sulfur material. But it is a big change. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Exxon Mobil, Jason, suggests that it might not be a bad idea to be the last man standing from a high sulfur fuel oil standpoint. Do you concur with that? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Gary, would you like to mention that one? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I don't know. We don't make a lot of high sulfur fuel oil and I don't really see it that way. I think you're going to see a lot of people, as you get closer to 2020, to liquidate what inventory of high sulfur fuel oil that they have. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Hi, good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning, Phil. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. The first question is just thinking ahead here with all the growth in U.S. light sweet crude production coming and, obviously, we have the Permian bottlenecks but those will be resolved, so all those barrels are going to be pointing towards the U.S. Gulf Coast and probably on the Houston side where you have a prime position. So how do you think about how that plays out? What might happen to discounts in the Gulf Coast and the export capabilities of the system today and where they're going? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Phil, this is Gary. I think, overall, it looks like most people are focused to tie a pipeline project with the dock project which allows the barrels to get to the water. I think you'll still have an advantage by being able to buy the barrels inland and buy the barrels on the Gulf Coast before they make their way to the water. But it looks like people are investing in logistics all the way to the water, not just to the Gulf. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So do you have a specific long-term view on like a Brent, Houston spread and what's reasonable based on transport? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. So I think we look at it, did it cost anywhere from $0.50 to $2 to get the barrel on the water and then you have some transit cost to get the barrel actually to a market. And so that puts MEH to Brent spread somewhere in the $2 to $2.50 type range. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. And then just a little bit of a follow-up to a prior question just on the heavy side. We have seen some tightening of, like, the LLS \u2013 Maya, LLS, Mars spread. So I'm just curious how you see that playing out for the rest of the year. You made the comments about the Middle East barrels coming back. So do you see a re-widening of that spread as we move into, call it, the fourth quarter? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: So I think I'll start with the heavy sour. So far, the Maya formula has really been impacted by the widespread in Brent/TI and the volatility in that Brent/TI spread. I think where we could get some relief on the heavy sour discounts is our view is as you move into the third and fourth quarter and you some turnaround activity in the Mid-Continent, you'll see some Cushing inventory begin to build which will allow the Brent/TI spread to widen out. And as that does, the Maya formula would again be impacted. And so you could see the heavy sour discounts widen out some. Overall, I think to get big relief and see significant discounts in medium or heavy, you do need to get the OPEC production back on and so how fast the OPEC production ramps up will certainly have a big impact on those quality discounts. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Anything specifically on the mediums? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: No, I don't, today, you look in pretty much all the crude grades are trading at their quality-adjusted breakeven values. And so I think that holds until you see the OPEC barrels come back to the Gulf and then you could see those discounts widen back out. Today, at least the barrels we're taking from OPEC, the Saudi barrels that we're taking are going to the West Coast and so we haven't seen an incentive to reintroduce those barrels into the Gulf. But as they make their way back to the Gulf, then I think you start to see the medium sours widen back out. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning, Matt. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Maybe to stick on this heavy sour theme, I think, Joe, in your opening comments, you talked about how you maximized heavy sour crude runs in the quarter. If I look at the data, your Gulf Coast system ran approximately 36% heavy plus resid in Q2. And then if we look way, way back to 2006, you ran approximately 51% heavy crude plus resid. I appreciate the system make-up has changed a little bit with Aruba and the crude toppers, but if you saw an environment with wider heavy dips over the next couple years, could you run more incremental heavies through your Gulf Coast system? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey, Matt. This is Lane. So I think one of the things you mentioned accurately is our portfolio is a little bit different than it used to be. In particular, we have the two topping units that run sweet and then also because of the clear margin that we've had on crude, like what Gary alluded to the answer in the last question was that you sort of have all the grades are on a quality basis equivalent. So it's really just been max crude rate. And so to the extent that refinery gets leveraged from that particular crude diet, it will maximize it. If you had us work \u2013 heavy sour was very, very disconnected and that was clearly the winner way over the other two, then we would run more heavy, we just may not run as much crude. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Sounds good. And then also want to circle back to the comment on how Line 9B from Enbridge provided some margin upside, just keeping in mind that Qu\u00e9bec had the big turnaround in the quarter. If you look at the EIA data, it seems to indicate that somebody is shipping WCS on Line 9B and then tankering it down and selling it to the Gulf Coast refineries. Is that a source of upside for Valero here? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: It would be, but we didn't ship any heavy, and actually shipping heavy for us would be an issue because mainline, the Enbridge mainline is prorated and so actually being able to nominate heavy and ship it through Line 9B would be very difficult for us to do. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Morning, Craig. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Just wanted to expand on Doug's cash question and I think Donna's comment that you appropriately want to retain some powder dry for potential acquisitions and obviously growth projects. But the growth projects have been pretty stable, maybe about $1 billion annually, and think that you all have commented in the past the M&A market is not especially cheap. And cash flow certainly looked to be increasing second half over first on sequentially lower maintenance CapEx, prospects for improving cracks and then, of course, there's the outlook for IMO 2020 coming up. So my question is, is there a logical limit, an absolute limit to the size of the cash build as you kind of think of sticking to this 40% to 50% payout ratio over time? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: So historically \u2013 and I'll let Donna tail onto this however she would like \u2013 but historically we have said that we were going to stick to our capital allocation framework, which we have for four years now and we'll continue to do it going forward. But a component of that really has been the commitment also to not build significant cash positions. And if you look at it, I would tell you \u2013 and, John, you can tell me I'm wrong, but we've been between $4 billion and $5 billion of cash now for a number of quarters in a row. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: We set the target of 40% to 50% on the payout ratio. We've consistently raised the dividend. So our commitment to the shareholders on an absolute basis has gone up, and we'll continue to look at that going forward. But we're going to stick to this. We're not going to continue \u2013 we're not going to allow ourselves to run the cash balances way up. We think it's fair to our investors that if we are building cash, we're going to deploy it. And when it makes sense to deploy it to them versus investing it in projects within the business, we're going to do that. Now, Lane and the team continue to develop projects. We executed on some acquisitions this quarter, which chewed up some cash. So, it's not all committed to share repurchases. We are using it to continue to grow the earnings capability of the business. But I think we're generally comfortable with the way we've been allocating it thus far. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I guess my question is \u2013 and I understand the cash balance has been relatively under control in recent quarters. But, I guess, if there's a break out as many people kind of envisioned for the industry in coming quarters in the next couple of years, how you might respond to that? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well \u2013 and I think that our expectation would be that over the next bunch of quarters, we are going to see \u2013 and certainly as we get closer to 2020, we should see significant increases in our free cash flow as a result to the IMO 2020, and we're going to maintain our commitment to our capital allocation framework through that process. Now, does that mean higher dividends? Could well be. Does it mean additional share repurchases? Could well be. We don't want to abort our disciplined process to executing capital projects. Okay? Lane and the team have done an outstanding job over the last several years of really getting their arms around this and being sure that we knew what the project was going to cost and what we expected the returns to be before we made the commitments to it. To the extent you try to accelerate that, you potentially degrade that process and we really would prefer not to do that. So, if we have an abundance of cash, acquisitions may look better. Share repurchases will still be certainly probably a big part of our use of cash and potential dividend increases. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. I appreciate the color. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Low with Redburn. Your line is now open. Peter Low - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning, Peter. Peter Low - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: I have one on the Texas City outage. I think in the release, you kind of break out the exceptional expense. But what was actually kind of the impact on earnings in terms of kind of the lost opportunity from that outage during the quarter? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi. This is Lane. So, our lost opportunity due to the outage during the second quarter was $150 million. Peter Low - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: Okay. That's great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey. Just one quick follow-up here. So, you have a couple of projects around expanding your alkylation capacity, and I was hoping you could just provide an update on where you stand regarding the EBITDA contribution potential from those projects. It looks like octane spreads have widened a little bit year-over-year, although we're nowhere near where we were, say, back in 2015. So, in general, do you expect that Tier 3 would reduce octane supply and maybe rising fuel economy standards would increase octane demand? Just any comments on that would be great. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi. So, Matt, this is Lane. You sort of answered the question, I believe. The Houston alky, we're still going to start-up in the first half of next year. Our strategic view on that is is that octane will get more valuable as we go forward via Tier 3 destroying octane and then, obviously, the fuel economy standards. And then, really, this increasing wide arbitrage between NGL and gasoline, or transportation fuel. So we still feel good about those. Our FID EBITDA at the time was $105 million. We're not going to \u2013 that's the number. We're not going to provide any other color with respect to sort of a forward market or even a prompt market view on that. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's Q&A session and I'd like to return the call to Mr. John Locke for any closing remarks. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Sandra. Look, we appreciate everybody joining us today and please contact me, the IR team, if you have additional questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 Valero Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. John Locke. Sir, you may begin. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Good morning. And welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you've not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, its says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We had solid safety and operational performance in the third quarter. Refinery utilization exceeded 99% and we set a new record for light sweet crude processing as discounts relative to Brent remained very attractive. We also delivered strong financial results outperforming the third quarter of last year despite a margin environment that was generally less favorable. Our use of the Diamond Pipeline and Enbridge Line 9B again contributed meaningfully to the performance of our Memphis and Quebec City Refineries, as these pipelines provided access to discounted Cushing and Canadian sweet crudes respectively. We look forward to the startup of the Sunrise Pipeline expansion, which is scheduled for November 1. This pipeline will add another 100,000 barrels per day of Permian pricing exposure to our Mid-Continent refineries and displays an equal volume of less competitively priced crude. We continued to deliver on our commitments to grow Valero's earnings capability through growth investments and acquisitions, while delivering returns to stockholders. The Diamond Green Diesel expansion was completed in August, bringing the current renewable diesel production capacity to 16,500 barrels per day. Development continues on a project to add a parallel facility and further expand the production capacity to a total of 44,000 barrels per day. A final investment decision is expected before year end. In September, our board of directors approved a project to construct a 55,000 barrel per day coker and a sulfur recovery unit at the Port Arthur refinery for a total cost of $975 million. Upon completion in 2022, the refinery will have two parallel crude vacuum coker trains. The additional coker capacity is expected to improve turnaround efficiency and provide margin benefits from increased heavy solid crude processing capability and reduce intermediate feedstock purchases. Earlier this month, we agreed to acquire three ethanol plants from Green Plains with a total nameplate capacity of 280 million gallons per year at a cost of $300 million, plus working capital estimated at $28 million. These plants utilize ICM and Delta-T technologies that are located in the corn belt, enabling us to transfer best practices from our existing portfolio and capture commercial and operational synergies. We expect to fund this acquisition with cash and anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and possible FTC review. Construction of the Central Texas pipelines and terminals and the Pasadena products terminal remains on track and work continues to progress on the Houston and St. Charles alkylation units and the Pembroke cogeneration plant. These projects are scheduled for completion in 2019 and 2020. Moving to Valero Energy Partners, we announced last week the execution of a definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common units of VLP at a price of $42.25 per unit. The transaction is expected to close as soon as possible after meeting customary closing conditions. Given the paradigm shift underway in MLP markets, Valero evaluated a range of options before the partnership and Valero concluded that a merger would provide the best outcome for Valero shareholders and VLP unit holders. This transaction offers compelling benefits for Valero shareholders in terms of cash flow synergies in a simplified structure. At the same time, the merger addresses MLP investor sentiment that has shifted away from favoring the high distribution growth, an equity funded drop-down model to a model that favors slower distribution growth and self-funded organic growth. The merger also offers a premium to VLP's average trading prices and immediate conversion of VLP's equity to cash. Now, turning to cash returns to stockholders. We paid out 55% of our year-to-date adjusted net cash provided by operating activities and we continue to target an annual payout ratio of between 40% to 50% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. As we look forward to the fourth quarter and into 2019, we remain optimistic. Global economic activity continues to grow at a reasonable pace. In the U.S., unemployment rates are at record lows. Domestic and international product demand is strong. Gasoline export volumes are expected to increase seasonally, while distillate export should moderate as winter demand picks up in the northern hemisphere. Despite margins incentivizing maximum distillate production at relatively high industry utilization, days of supply for distillate remain near five-year lows. And with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you, Joe. For the third quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $856 million, or $2.01 per share, compared to $841 million or $1.91 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Operating income for the refining segment in the third quarter of 2018 was $1.3 billion compared to $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2017. The $90 million decrease is mainly attributed to lower gasoline and secondary products margins, partially offset by wider discounts for sour and sweet crude oils versus Brent. Refining throughput volumes in the third quarter of 2018 averaged 3.1 million barrels per day and throughput capacity utilization was 99%. Throughput volumes were 207,000 barrels per day higher than the third quarter of 2017 when the operations of five of our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries were impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.67 per barrel were $0.08 per barrel lower than third quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher throughput in the third quarter of 2018. The ethanol segment generated $21 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $82 million in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease of $61 million was mainly due to lower ethanol prices in the third quarter of 2018. Operating income for the VLP segment in the third quarter of 2018 was $90 million compared to $69 million in the third quarter of 2017. The increase of $21 million was mostly attributed to contributions from the Port Arthur terminal assets and Parkway Pipeline which were acquired by VLP in November of 2017. For the third quarter of 2018, general and administrative expenses were $209 million and net interest expense was $111 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $517 million and the effective tax rate was 24%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $9.1 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $3.6 billion, of which $128 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion of cash was 24%. At the end of September, we had $5.3 billion of available liquidity excluding cash of which $750 million was available for only VLP. We generated $496 million of cash from operating activities in the third quarter. Included in this amount is $729 million use of cash to fund working capital. Excluding working capital, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.2 billion. Moving to capital investments, which excludes acquisitions, we made $604 million of growth and sustaining investments in the third quarter. Sustaining investments of $435 million include $171 million of turnaround and catalyst costs. The balance of capital invested in the quarter was for growth. With regard to financing activities, we returned $775 million to our stockholders in the third quarter. $341 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 3.8 million shares of Valero common stock. As of September 30, we had approximately $2.8 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to expect 2018 capital investments to total $2.7 billion with about $1.7 billion allocated to sustaining the business and $1 billion to growth. Included in this total are turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.76 million to 1.81 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 265,000 to 285,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 480,000 to 500,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $3.80 per barrel. Excluding the acquisition of the three ethanol plants from Green Plains, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4.1 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For 2018, we expect the annual effective tax rate to be about 23%. For the fourth quarter, we expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $220 million, net interest expense is estimated at $110 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $525 million. Lastly, given recent declines in ethanol and biodiesel RIN costs, we are reducing expected RIN's expense for the year to between $450 million and $550 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that our callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, and nice quarter as usual. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Joe, if we could, one thing you didn't talk about in the overview, but is certainly very topical here, the IMO 2020 thought process. So, story comes out, administration doesn't like it, no surprise there. But the IMOs meeting this week. Can you talk about maybe what we're seeing, and what your expectations are, how that fits together? And if there is any change in how you're looking at the potential impact about this time next year into early 2020? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hello Roger, good question. We'll let Jason speak a little bit about that. Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Hey, Roger, this is Jason. I'm sure many of you all have been following that meeting you just referenced. The Marine Environmental Protection Committee's meeting is going on all week in London. And I'm sure you all have experienced the same as we have, it's a closed meeting, so information trickles out in drips and drabs at different times, but this is what we've gleaned from it, from what we've been able to ascertain. Looks like there's been two very positive developments come out of the committee so far. Looks like the carriage ban will go into effect on its original proposed date of March 1, 2020. There was a proposal I believe by Bangladesh to delay it, that was defeated. And it will be officially voted on either today or tomorrow, to lock it in. So, we think that's a very big deal since it gives the port states a powerful tool to help them force the new specs. You don't have to prove the ship burn non-compliant fuel, they just have to look and see \u2013 just having it in the fuel tank on board is a breach of the regulation but unless the ship has a scrubber. That's going to help a lot with maintaining compliance. The second bit of good news relate to this experience building phase proposal that's caused quite a bit of commotion and that's what was referred to in that Wall Street Journal article. Now, exactly how this proposal would work was never really clear to us. The proponents themselves actually took the step of issuing a clarifying statement, saying it wouldn't delay or phase into spec change. Nevertheless, there was a lot of worry that this might be a path at least of potential delay or watering down of the standards. So, there was a lot of debate on it at the meeting and the report we got yesterday was that the committee reached an agreement at the end of the day that the proposal will be limited to data collection and analysis and cover nothing else. So, there'd be nothing about a phase-in or initially relaxed enforcement. So our main take away so far is that the committee seems to remain firm in its commitment to fully implement the spec change on January 1, 2020, and then make sure the right enforcement tools are available. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Second unrelated question, you've got two acquisitions coming at you this quarter, the ethanol and the VLP deal. How should we think about the 40% to 50% payout of cash flow in terms of dividends and share repos relative to the commitments in this particular period with the acquisitions or do we think about the acquisitions as a balance sheet event and the CFFO is the normal process? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Roger, that's another good question. And we've been very consistent in our messaging, in our execution around our capital allocation framework. And really what we're talking about here is the discretionary uses. There is no consideration of affecting our maintenance CapEx, or turnarounds or the dividend in a negative way. So, this really is focused on the discretionary uses and if you look at what we've done, we've got really good growth projects. The Diamond Pipeline is performing very well. We've got the coker project, which has significant returns, it's under development. We got the (17:19) Central Texas pipeline and many more really good growth projects that are underway. If you look at it from an acquisition perspective, which is another component of the discretionary piece, we got the ethanol plants which Martin can talk about here in a bit, but we were able to buy ethanol plants in a down market. And when we're looking at acquisitions, that's always what we're trying to do. And then on the repurchases, we've got the payout ratio which is overriding, but we've been very ratable in our acquisition of our shares and we're focused on buying this. So, what I would say here is that you should expect that our behavior to remain consistent going forward with what we've done in the past. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Awesome. Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay, buddy. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Paul. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I have to apologize that first question is somewhat similar to what Roger just asked on the IMO, but I want to focus that, Jason, you guys have a lot of contact in DC and in the White House and all. Yeah, I know Joe then met with President Trump for a number of times. Can you give us some insight that what exactly the White House trying to do? Or what is the proposal they have in mind in terms of slow down, the rollout? I mean, what kind of mechanism or what kind of program that they have in place or what that they are thinking? Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Sure. And I don't think they've come to a conclusion yet. And one thing we shouldn't do is read too much into this one story with an anonymous source from the administration as being a statement of their policy. From our discussions, we don't think the administration has reached or formed conclusions yet. They all understand the economic impact of the potential changes, but there is nothing yet. Now the word was, they were supporting that experienced building phase and in that context or it seemed to be that it would lead to some type of delay or lax enforcement upfront, but looks like that was very clearly shut down within the committee. Importantly, we were told the U.S. delegation actually supported this conclusion of basically morphing that proposal into something that only dealt with data-gathering. So I think it's an ongoing discussion. They don't have a firm commitment yet or firm position yet and they're just trying to understand the situation. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Jason, just curious that in the conversations you have with the White House staff, does any occasion come out as a nuclear option saying that U.S. could even drop out from the ECA destination. Can the President have the authority that just use executive order to get out if he want to? Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: It is pretty complicated. I don't think they're having discussions a lot about that yet, anything that extreme. And we've tried to understand this is very complicated, this international kind of treaty law. And I can tell you what we've been able to glean, although we're definitely not experts on it. It sounds like he could pull out or the U.S. could pull out of the entire treaty, the MARPOL treaty or the entire Annex. He doesn't have the option to just pull out of the IMO 2020 sulfur regulation. And that would take 12 months notice and there is no certainty around whether the Senate would have to approve that or go along with it. But the point is, if he pulled out of the entirety of Annex VI, which is the narrowest thing you could deal with, that covers all of the international marine, air pollution requirements. So, the ramifications would go way beyond the IMO sulfur, the 2020 regulations. So, it wouldn't be taken lightly by the administration and it would have ramifications way beyond that spec. So, I think it would take a lot of thinking and see if they want to do that. Even if you did pull out of the treaty, the other complication is a lot of the requirements and regulations or provisions of the treaty have been incorporated into separate federal statutes. So, even if the President withdrew from the treaty, the statutes can't be changed except by an act of Congress. So they would still be in place. So, it's a very long and messy process to go down that road. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. And my second question that maybe is for either Gary or Lane. Maya, seems like it's being \u2013 it's priced very expensive, do you find that is attractive for you to run it now? Or that you can have other alternative you would be able to find this far more attractive, are you running it at all? And then maybe as a final, after the roll in of the VLP, will the reporting format of the companies be changed that you just roll everything into refining and no longer report VLP or logistic result on a separate item? Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Paul. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, Paul, thank you. Maya question, certainly the volatility between Brent and WTI in the Midland Cushing spread along with fuel getting strengthened has wreaked havoc on the Maya formula and so we would certainly say that Maya is not priced competitively in the market today. We had several conversations with PMI. I think they are well aware that their barrels are not been priced competitively into the U.S. Gulf Coast and they will make adjustments as we move forward. I also think that Maya is not really as relevant of a marker for heavy sour crude as it used to be. Certainly in our system, the only heavy sour barrels that we buy that are priced off the Maya formula are the barrels that we get from Mexico. The remainder of the barrels are not priced off of Maya. Today, Canadian heavy barrel and the U.S. Gulf Coast has $8 to $10 advantage over Maya. So, we still see a good incentive to push heavy sour crudes into our refining systems but I would agree, Maya is not priced competitively today. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: And then I guess the next question was, Paul your fourth, was relative to... Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.: The segment reporting question. Yeah. So we assume a process of evaluating the segment reporting going forward once VLP is no longer publicly listed. We don't have anything to share with you at this moment but that is something that we're looking at. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay, buddy. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Good morning, everybody. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi, Doug. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : I wanted to get your views on market fundamentals and specifically, while distillate demand and inventories appear pretty positive, the converse seems to be true for gasoline, although net exports for both seem to be pointed in the right direction. So, my question regards really demand trends in the domestic and the regional market that you guys are involved in for these two products. And also whether you sense that price has allocated demand somewhat in North America and Latin America in recent months, whether we are seeing some demand destruction of any sort. So, just kind of an overview on gasoline and distillate please? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Sure. This is Gary. I think, basically demand is kind of where we'd expected it to be going into this year. You've had a little bit of demand growth compared to last year, about 1%. The real surprise, especially on the gasoline side is just very high refinery utilization, so. And year-to-date, we've averaged 93% refinery utilization, 2.6% higher than where we were last year. With that increase in refinery utilization, gasoline production is up about 2% over where it was last year. And even though you've had an increase in demand you've had about 2 to 1 increase in production over demand, and it's caused a surplus in the inventory build. As we move into the fourth quarter, I think you've seen gasoline cracks get very weak. Some of that is typically as you move out of driving season, you see weaker demand for gasoline. And then you also have the potential to even slow the gasoline production further as you move out into RVP transition and get butane into the pool. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: I think, there are a few bullish signs in the gasoline market, inventory has actually grown in the last couple of weeks and a lot of that is due to what you alluded to, we've seen very good gasoline exports. In the last three weeks in a row, we've averaged about 1 million barrels a day of gasoline being exported. In our system, we're seeing very strong South American demand. Of course, in South America they're moving in. So, there's summer driving season, which has been supportive of the gasoline crack. And when you look at gasoline inventory on a days of supply basis and you take those exports into account, we are about the five-year average range on a parent days of supply. On the supply side, it looks like we could be getting some help as well. In the last set of hydro data I've looked at, it looks like Northwest Europe hydroskimming margins have turned negative. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Conversion \u2013 even conversion refinery economics are about breakeven. In the U.S., we're seeing very tight margins on reformers and cat crackers. And even in the U.S., the hydroskimming refinery, if you don't have an advantage crude supply those economics are getting challenged as well. So I think you'll see some gasoline come off the market. In fact, in the last week of BOE stats, you did see gasoline drop fairly significantly. Gasoline yield drop fairly significantly. And then I think, you're starting to see some indications of some run cuts in the industry as well, the Brent curve move from backwardation to Contango, it's may be an indication that you're getting some run cuts that are starting to pressure down the front part of that Brent curve. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay. Can you spend just a second on distillate as well? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. So distillate I think if you look at where distillate inventories look both on an absolute basis and certainly on a days of supply basis, we're very low. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: We really just haven't been able to replenish distillate inventories since the hurricane last year. We continue to see very good export demand for distillate as well as domestic demand. And certainly in the Atlantic Basin as you're moving into heating oil season, we would expect demand to be very strong for distillate. Then again on the distillate side, I think, if you do get some hydroskimming refineries and some refinery run cuts that will even be more supportive of the distillate market as well, because you'll take some of the distillate production offline as well. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Sure. Thanks a lot guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Joe, I'm sorry my first one is an IMO question as well. So I wonder if I could take advantage of Jason being on the line. Jason, the situation as it relates to I think Paul's question earlier about the White House and so on. Our understanding is that it's really the enforcement is really done to member states. Do you have any thoughts on what the signaling from the U.S. whether they pulled out or not, does it really come down to the penalties or the enforcement mechanism which could ultimately be eased if \u2013 as one method of a kind of work around. I'm just trying to think about how the rule making evolves over the next 12 months? And any thoughts you might have on that would be appreciated? Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. No, you're right. That's the key component and historically the U.S. has been one of the most zealous enforcers of MARPOL through the Coast Guard and the EPA. And think about how shipping works and like I said all shipping within the U.S. is already covered by the tighter sulfur spec, which we seem to be fine with the 0.1% in the ECA. The only other shipping that's involved is stuff going to and from the U.S., and if the U.S. didn't want to enforce it especially now that we have the Carriage rule in place, the flag state would have authorities to enforce it and wherever that ships, the other end of the voyage, right, where it's coming to and from, that port state would also be able to enforce it, and has the Carriage rule to help it. So, you'd say even if the U.S. chose not to enforce, which would be very uncharacteristic of us, there should still be a lot of mechanisms in place to do it. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. A lot of moving parts, we'll see how it plays out. But I guess, my second question is also kind of related, if I may, and it really gets to the Doug Terreson's question about the gasoline market. It's maybe one for Gary, but whoever wants to chime in, our understanding is that there's a broad consensus, Europe \u2013 let's face it, this is the best thing to happen to European refineries in 20 years. There was an expectation utilization is going to go up at the same time as a lot of U.S. light sweet crude is going to make its way to European markets at the end of next year. How do you see that impacting the Atlantic Basin gasoline market and related to IMO, if I may, is it a kind of an offset, which is to swing the cat feed into the bunker fuel market, there is a viable solution to perhaps resolving some of the potential tightness in the distillate side? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Doug. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I think the way you characterize it is very similar to the way we see it. I think, it looks like for the next several months, certainly fourth quarter through first quarter gasoline market is going to remain weak. And certainly as European refiners run more the U.S. light sweet crude, you have the potential to put more gasoline on the market. And it's really when you start getting into the fourth quarter and people start to reacting to change for IMO and you pull some of the VGOs out of the cat to get them into the bunker market, the gasoline balances start to tighten back up along with some demand growth. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So does that cap the upside risk on potential diesel margin spike as it relates to IMO demand? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: I don't really know that it spikes. No, I don't really know that I understand what you're asking, Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So the perception is that diesel margin spike on the back of swing from away from high sulfur fuel oil into marine diesel. But if we're cutting back cat feed on weak gasoline markets, doesn't that solve part of the problem? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. I think, most of the forecast that we think says that that will happen, but it will help make up for the shortfall in the marine bunker and the high sulfur fuel being pulled out of the market. Combination of that with ULSD going to the marine market as well. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. A lot of moving parts. Thanks, fellows, appreciate the answers. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Thanks, guys. I was wondering, if you could share some thoughts around your CapEx plans next year. Now with the logistics business rolled up and the coker spend particularly on the growth side, and how that looks between your business segments? And if you may longer term just any thoughts around that allocation split? How that will evolve with the new business structure? John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey, Benny, this is John. We really don't have our capital guidance out there yet for 2019. If you look at what we've done here in the last couple of years, it's been sort of in this 50/50 allocation logistics and refining. I mean we've gotten projects set out there obviously, that's part of the bigger strategic plan, but we only have guidance on this year. Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey guys, sorry. I don't have an IMO question. My question is more on the very strong performance on the North Atlantic side. I just wanted to understand was it both the assets equally contributing? Or was it (33:31) capturing the European cracks really well, or was it also the Qu\u00e9bec city benefiting from the light-light spread? Any color you can provide on the very strong results on the North Atlantic region? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey, Manav, this is Lane. So really what you saw in our North Atlantic strong crack attainment was our exposure to this wide Brent TIR and really it's our line 9 reversal that we invested in. We only had access to sort of the distressed Canadian crudes coming out of that region of the world. So that was really what drove us not only to have exposure to the price of those crudes, but also to run a little bit more rate as a result of that. Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And one follow-up sir. E15 was recently announced by President Trump and there were some concerns that it might eat up into a small portion of the gasoline demand, but I know you guys have very strong views that it's not going to be as material as people think. There are lot of challenges to E15, so if you could give some color on that also please? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Sure. I'll let Jason talk to you a minute about that. Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. You're right. Back in October 11, the White House announced they were going to direct the EPA to start a rule making to get the E15 RVP waiver in place for next summer. And this is something ethanol guys have been fighting for a long time. It's been at the top of their list. We don't think it's going to be a sudden big increase in ethanol penetration. But first of all, there are lots of reasons E15 hadn't taken off already. Not just \u2013 it's not just related to this RVP waiver. Retailers have concerns about equipment compatibility. There's risk to engines that aren't warranted for the fuel, who's liable for it if you have an issue. Questions about consumer demand. But \u2013 and there's only about 1% of the stations in the U.S. have E15 now about 1,400 stations. And when you figure out what will it take to offer E15, there's varying questions, basically you have to spend some money, and you have to spend a lot of money or little money kind of depending on the configuration of your station. But there's going to have to be some capital spend. And that brings us to the legality of this rule. Now, there is a big debate about whether the EPA has the authority to grant this RVP waiver for E15, like some people think they do and then a lot of people also think that it's going to have to be done by Congress because the RVP waiver for E10 is actually included in the RFS statute itself. So, one thing is certain is whenever the EPA rule goes final, there's going to be a bunch of people suing, a lot of lawsuits challenging EPA's authority to do this. And this is going to take a couple of years for that to work its way through the courts before you get a final answer. So, now put yourself into shoes of one of these retailers who's got to spend money to able to offer E15. Now, you're going to spend money with the risk of having stranded capital because in a couple years, the court may void it. So, I think that's going to be \u2013 have some type of a chilling effect on the capital rollout, which will keep things \u2013 keep the rollout from being very aggressive, along with just the general problems with E15 we've talked about a lot. Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you guys. This was very insightful. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You bet. Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Just wanted to circle back on the pad on the Atlantic Basin. Part of that \u2013 I appreciate the color on what the strength there was. I wanted to just sort of drill down on the product side. You're able to get your distillate yield up, gasoline volumes down, obviously optimizing through the dynamics there, but just wanted to get an understanding if there's anything on the product pricing side or moves you have been able to do in that market that they're also helping to realize margin there? And then how to think about that on a go-forward basis versus broader regional dynamics? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Lane again. I think, the only other comment I would make is that our Qu\u00e9bec refinery, the way we have that refinery configured, it makes a \u2013 have a very high distillate yield for the kind of crude that it runs. The only time you get into a market where the gasoline crack is depressed in relation to the heat crack that refinery will perform very, very well. And as we all know, I mean, the heat crack has sort of being outperforming the gas crack here of late. So when you think about that as a base going forward, that's really one of the big drivers for that performance in that area is Qu\u00e9bec's distillate yields. Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And I guess my follow-up also not an IMO question, but wanted to ask is how the Western Canadian heavy and short, near-term and then maybe looking to 2019 plans, just to getting more WCS down into the Gulf Coast if it was Lake Charles. I was \u2013 we've been hearing a lot about rail and incremental transport volumes. So I just wanted to see if you have any color there or an update on what we can expect. I'm thinking about this also longer-term with respect to the Port Arthur coker decision? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. This is Gary. I think, in the short term, really you're going to depend on rail to clear the production in Western Canada. And I think you'll continue to see that market constrain. We're certainly ramping up our rail volume some. We did about 30,000 barrels a day in the third quarter. We expect to get that up to 40,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter. And then it looks like there's some additional rail being dedicated to that market early next year. But I think before you see a meaningful shift in the Western Canadian differentials, you're going to have to have one of the pipeline projects done. And it looks like, the first opportunity for that would be the Line 3 Replacement Enbridge project, which looks like the earliest that would happen would be late next year. Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much gentlemen. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Joe, I was wondering if you could just spend a minute walking through the rationale for buying in VLP versus potentially doing something with the IDRs or other options that are available to you. And then additionally, you mentioned in your prepared comments that there will be some cash flow synergies and so I was wondering if you could give some sort of quantification of that? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. You bet. I'll take the first part and I'll let Donna take the second part. But if you go back to the original plan with VLP, we've used the MLP structure and its lower cost to capital to develop projects that supported Valero's core business. And whenever we did a project at VLP or at Valero for subsequent drop to VLP, it was always with a, does it benefit Valero and help integration into supply chain going forward. So that was where we started. Okay. We got it out there. We have this great base of logistics assets that we could drop down and opportunities enable us to provide the MLP investor with a clear line of sight to ratable growth. We had a sub 3% yield on VLP's equity and we were executing as promised. Then the MLP markets appetite changed significantly from a drop-down driven high-growth sponsored MLP equity to a self-funded low growth model with corporate and governance rights. And the cost of capital was also higher than that at VLO. So we looked at this for a year or more. We're very patient. We watched carefully for any catalyst change that would support a shift back to our original design and we saw none. So we looked at every available option. We agreed that the best outcome for both Valero Energy and the VLP owners was the buy-in. VLP unitholders get a premium to the average trading in the market and VLO stockholders get an accretive transaction. So it was a win-win, which are very hard to find and it's dealt with a problem we've got or that we had, which was that we had an entity out there that we needed to retain control over and we weren't able to grow it. So, Donna, do you to take the second piece? Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.: Yes. In regard to the other option that we've... Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.: \u2013 we've looked at so a lot of talks in the market had been about eliminating the IDRs, you know, unfortunately that doesn't solve the underlying issue of being able to fund growth because you still wouldn't have access to the equity market. Some other options that we've seen MLP's chose are converting to C corps. As Joe mentioned these assets are key to us, and maintaining control over them is absolutely key to support a lot of our primary refineries and we didn't want to put the MLP into a structure that jeopardize Valero maintaining control over those assets. So we looked at a lot of different options as Joe indicated. We took our time doing so. We have spent the last year also looking at all of this \u2013 all of the options at whether or not we really thought the MLP equity market would recover at anytime soon and we kept coming back to buying in was the best solution for both the unitholders and the shareholders of Valero. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You know, Brad, it's interesting in that every solution that one might consider is unique to their individual circumstances. And somebody else might choose to do it differently. VLP was small enough and it afforded us this opportunity. If it was huge, we probably wouldn't have had the opportunity to do something like this or we would've had to do it differently. So anyway we think we made the right decision and the timing was such that we were able to execute it now we decided to go ahead and do it. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then any quantification of the synergy benefit? Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.: They're coming from a lot of different places. Obviously the leakage fund \u2013 unitholder \u2013 public unitholder distribution is a large piece of that. The public company cost is another piece of that. And just the simplified structure cuts a lot of administrative costs out of the equation. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Appreciate the thorough answer. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Low with Redburn. Your line is now open. Peter Low - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one is just on the \u2013 hi, the first one is just from the ethanol acquisition. Can you give us a more color on the strategic rationale behind that? And perhaps whether you'd look to do more deals in the biofuel space in the future? And the second was just a quick one. In the release, you talk about a $700 million working capital build. Is that simply the impact of rising oil prices? So should we expect it to unwind in future quarters? Thanks. Martin Parrish - Valero Energy Corp.: Sure. On the ethanol, this is Martin. We take a long-term view at this. And if you step back and look at ethanol, it's going to be in the gasoline pool for a long time, right, and it's a core part of our strategy. So the opportunity came up to buy three quality plants. So we took it. We see corn ethanol as the most competitive octane source in the world. We expect ethanol demand to grow globally. If you look at exports, they are up about 30% year-on-year for the last three years. Exports will be 10% of production this year and you also see domestic production has been growing at about 3.6% a year, this year that growth is going to slow to something 1%, 1.5%, so that big increase in production is slowing down. So we think things are going to start improving on the supply demand balance and with that we will get some margin improvements. So it was just, we're always looking at acquisitions, our last one was in 2014 for ethanol and it just became an opportunity to us, but looked good and we took it. On the future, we will continue to look in this space and then the other thing we're obviously looking at in the biofuels is what Joe mentioned, a decision on the Diamond Green Diesel too, that will be coming up before the end of the year and that's it. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: And then Peter you were asking about working capital? Peter Low - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: That's right. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: What was your question again, sorry, just repeat it? Peter Low - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: It was, there's is quite a big build in the quarter, about $700 million. I was just wondering, was that simply an effect of rising oil prices, so should we expect that kind of unwinds over the next few quarters? Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.: That was a combination of some volume and some price impact and there should be a fair portion of that that will reverse itself. Peter Low - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: That's great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning team. First question I had was around Port Arthur and the decision around sanctioning the coker project. Can you talk a little bit about the economics of it? How should we think about it either on an IRR basis or incremental EBITDA for the capital that you're spending there? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi Neil, this is Lane. So, really the benefits are twofold. One is the feedstock flexibility, there was an earlier caller that asked the question around our view of Canadian heavy sour in the Gulf Coast, and we certainly had a longer term view there was going to be considerable amount of heavy sour in the Gulf Coast and in addition to that just our overall sort of how that fits into our optimization of our Gulf Coast. We'd like to benefit from the feedstock flexibility. And secondly, it's turnaround efficiencies. This is a two \u2013 today, this is almost a two train refiner with the exception of a big coker. So anytime we're taking certain units offline to do turnarounds, there is a lot of synergies and having this additional to essentially finally separate this refinery into two separate trains and build and execute turnarounds in a more efficient manner. With respect to EBITDA, I'd characterize that we think the EBITDA is around $325 million using mid-cycle prices and I am going to preface it by saying that mid-cycle doesn't include IMO. So we've always been \u2013 we've been pretty vocal saying this is not really an IMO project. This is very much about optimizing our system. Obviously, if our outlook is to make $325 million in our mid-cycle case, then it's got a lot of upside in an IMO 2020 universe. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I appreciate that Lane. And the follow-up is just on the Brent/WTI differentials. There is two parts to this question. One is, how do you see that evolving over the next six months to a year with the spread obviously at a very wide level and arguably beyond transportation economics, but then again with the potential for Cushing to build in the intermediate term? And then the second is that you guys have done a good job of whether it's through the Sunrise Pipeline or through the Diamond Pipeline actually getting access to those light barrels. So, can you just talk about how you are evolving the system to capture those inland discounts? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey Neil, this is Gary. I think we see with the start up of the Sunrise Pipeline and then production increasing around Cushing, you will have more barrels beginning to make their way to the Cushing hub. Certainly, as PADD 2 turnarounds wind down, you'll get some demand back, but most forecast I see shows that Cushing continues to build through next year and I think you really have to get to the point of late next year when some of the large Midland Permian to the Gulf Coast projects come on that allow Permian production to clear to the Gulf and some of the barrels that are currently going to Cushing get pulled away before you see Cushing start to draw again. Yes, and back to our system, Sunrise and Diamond and then Line 9 have all increased our access to certainly the Midland and Cushing barrels, which has been a significant uplift for us. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks team. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Hi, good morning everyone. For the IMO, to make it simple for the IMO question, what's your current assumption for the number of barrels a day that are going to be affected here when we get to 2020? I just wanted to sort of simplify the whole question? Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, I don't know that we have an absolute number that we give. There is roughly 3.5 million barrels a day of Marine Bunker being consumed and our view is a majority of that has to switch to the 0.5 spec. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Yes. And essentially although you said the coker project is not IMO related, I guess you're expecting essentially the IMO change to go through at considerable scale basically? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey Paul, this is Lane. We do believe IMO will go ahead. I think that's our view. But we didn't fund or we didn't do this project because of IMO 2020. We see a lot of upside. We see a lot of upside on that. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Right. So, is it then based on a heavy light spread assumption, can you talk a little bit about the midcycle that you referenced as being the rationale for the investment? And I have one follow-up which was just, given the VLP takeback, could you keep going and actually buy MLPs now? Is that a thought? Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: I'd say Midcycle is just the way we define it. Midcycle is sort of the average \u2013 the last average of the last 10 years sort of pricing scenario, so we're trying to capture a full-blown refining cycle absent sort of what we consider to be major dislocations primarily I would say in the domestic crude market, for example, when we had the Brent/WTI blow out a few years ago out to 30, we throw that out and what we consider to be a midcycle. So that's how we price it. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Sure. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: All right, Paul. Paul, you got a follow-up for Lane or... Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : No, I was going to ask about this idea that maybe you keep going and buying some MLPs? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well, I mean, we've always had that opportunity quite honestly, right. We could have done it in VLO and then subsequently drop the assets to VLP. We'll continue to look at them. But here again I think our general view of the space is that we need logistics assets that provide better access for crude and feedstocks into the refinery and more access to markets with products moving out. And to the extent that there is an opportunity out there that scratches those, one of those two itches or both, I think we will really look hard at it. Otherwise, I don't think that \u2013 it's certainly not what I would say a specific point of focus where we're looking at and saying, gee whiz, we need to go now and roll up MLPs. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Understood. Thank you, Joe. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You bet. Take care, Paul. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Hi Craig. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Could you all walk through the timelines for the buildout of contracted and acquired assets in Mexico and Peru? Maybe elaborate on the potential export implications both on volume and margin? And Joe relating to your last comment, could you opine on the opportunity for additional Latin American infrastructure opportunities post the Peru investment? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: As far as timeline... Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: As far as timeline, we acquired the terminal, it's operational. There is a second terminal... Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: That's Peru. Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.: That's Peru, I'm sorry. And there is a second terminal in the northern part of Peru that we are in the process of reactivating and that should be first quarter of next year. So we'll have over 1 million barrels of receipt facility in Peru. And in Mexico, the Veracruz terminal, which is about 2.1 million barrels of storage should be in service the end of this year, early first quarter of 2020 and then the inland terminals which combine between Puebla and Mexico City should be the end of 2020 (sic) [2019], first quarter of 2021 (sic) [2020]. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. So that's that. And then Craig, we do continue to look for opportunities to put a stake in the ground internationally. Gary, do you or Rich have any other comments on that? Okay. No? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: No. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. So we'll continue to look \u2013 I think really part of my focus right now and the team's focus is, okay, we've got the terminal in Peru and we bought an entire business. So Gary is running \u2013 not only we got the terminaling operation, but we've got a marketing business that was associated with that. And it takes a while to get your arms around things and to be sure that we're maximizing the value of it. So we're looking at that as a potential stake in the ground to allow us to do more on the western coastline of South America. And then I think we'll look for opportunities to continue to try to move to the eastern coastline down the road, but no specific plans right now. Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Hi, good morning. Just a couple of clarifying questions or follow-ups. First one would be, obviously between the ethanol plants and the growth opportunities in VLP, you've had a string of announcements recently. I think one of the questions that's been out there is just can you \u2013 with the organic pieces of this can you fund this all within the construct of your existing capital budget framework? And I know you don't want to give specific 2019 guidance, I guess yet, but just trying to clarify that key point? And then Joe just generally, I mean do you feel like there are other opportunities out there that you're looking at? Or you just happen to have a string of things that just kind of came up recently? Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Well. So, we're not deviating from the capital allocation framework. And yes, to answer your question even though we haven't provided guidance for 2019. I think we generally provided ranges that we thought were with our capital ranges and we're not deviating from that. So that's not going to change. I would say that the timing of these opportunities \u2013 acquisitions are always opportunistic. And so Martin and his team did a good thorough evaluation with Rich's team on the ethanol plants and we had a willing seller. And so we had an opportunity to buy at numbers that were very attractive relative to deals we've looked at over the last couple of years. The VLP buy-in, it was just timely for us to do that. Again, we were patient. I mean it could have happened in June, right, but we wanted to wait and see if the market changed. When we finally concluded that we had a basically a broken equity out there and this VLP wasn't going to do for VLO what we expected it to do, it's time to move on and get out of it. And that's exactly what we did. So it is more coincidental that these things happened at the same time and certainly a sign of things to come. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Fair enough. Just a second question is just on the throughput guidance for the fourth quarter. Yeah, I think you're assuming at the midpoint may be 96%, 97% type utilizations. I guess, I'm just a little surprised by that because of the commentary around some parts of the world needing to do run cuts. So I guess, obviously, Valero is a low cost refiner. So perhaps it's less impactful for you guys. So I was just wondering how you think about your throughput guidance in the context of the pretty weak gasoline cracks that are out there right now? R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.: So, Phil, this is Lane. I think when you think about throughput, it's primarily feedstock and crude, right. So at this time, we think our assets are pretty competitive and so our outlook is not that unchanged minus whatever turnaround activity we have in a particular region. Gary's comments earlier around where margins are, are predominantly we see a weak North Western Europe hydroskimming margins and Mediterranean hydroskimming margins. And then we are starting to see sort of breakeven economics on conversion units in the entire Atlantic Basin. So we'll just see how that affects our \u2013 in reality, what our throughput is, but at the time we gave this guidance that was kind of how we saw the universe for the next three months. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for all the added color guys. Two quick follow-ups if I could. Obviously there's been some questions on capital allocation. I realize you're not deviating from your historical approach and also, we're not in a position to provide 2019 CapEx guidance. But just curious how views around leverage are influenced by the recent developments, it seems like obviously organic investments, acquisitions provide some opportunity for capital deployment. The share price has obviously pulled back and you've talked about opportunistic buys historically. So can you just remind us or revisit views around sort of consolidated leverage? Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah. So our target for leverage is between 28% to 30% and we're at the lower \u2013 at 24% to the lower half of that. We have a large cash balance today to fund a lot of the things that we're talking about as well as some borrowing capability. Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC : Okay. So, no change in that, feel comfortable with it. Okay. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: No. Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC : Also following up on the E15 question, appreciate the market views. They're really helpful. But I'm just curious how a potential approval of the President's proposal might impact your own ethanol operations if at all. And then also any views around additional ethanol acquisitions. I think Joe in your prepared remarks you had noted federal review of the Green Plains plant acquisition as a condition. So I'm just wondering if there's any market concentration issues at any point that you think you might run into. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Martin Parrish - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, this is Martin. I would say on the E15, it really doesn't impact our ethanol production thought process any, go along with what Jason said on that. It's going to be slow and very measured penetration into the market here in the United States. So it really doesn't impact how we're looking at things. As far as future acquisitions, we keep looking at them. I mean the largest producers are still only 11%, 12% of the market space in the United States. So it's probably not an issue. Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for the added color, guys. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Your line is now open. Jason Gabelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hey guys. How's it going? If I could ask two quick ones. Firstly, just on cash from ops. It looks like in addition to the working capital drag there was an additional $200 million of cash drag that was unexplained in the press release. I was wondering if you could provide any commentary around that? And then secondly just on gasoline demand growth. I know you referenced 1% growth kind of year-to-date, but it seems like that growth has been moderating a bit over the past couple of months. Are you seeing a similar trend? Thanks. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: You want to take the second one first? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Hey, Jason. Yeah, let's take the second one first. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Gasoline. Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Okay. Yeah, so on gasoline demand, I'd tell you that the only real visibility we had to that is through our wholesale channel. Quarter-over-quarter our volumes were up 5%. So our wholesale volumes grew at better than the demand growth. We did see slight reduction in volume from the second quarter to third quarter only about 1%, but we really attributed to that. It looked like most of where we lost demand was in the Southeast and was storm related. Jason Gabelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.: And on the question about the remaining cash usage, we made a contribution to our pension plan in September, about $100 million and the rest of it is just a lot of miscellaneous items. Jason Gabelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Great. Thanks a lot. Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Coming back to Prashant's question on WCS, you mentioned that we should expect a small near-term increase in rail volumes. I was wondering have you made any pipeline commitments on the future pipes, like L3R, KXL, or the transbound expansion? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, this is Gary. No, we don't have any pipeline commitments, but we do have some arrangements with producers where we would buy barrels in the Gulf when those pipelines are done. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then on the West Coast, we saw a pretty expensive ANS barrels in Q3 and then I think today, we're back to a premium versus Brent. Any color on what's going on with ANS? Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.: Yeah, I think that the West Coast market was actually the most impacted by some of the volume slowdown from the Middle East. Some of the Saudi barrels and Kuwaiti barrels that went out to the West Coast kind of took pressure off the ANS. So, as we see the Saudi volumes ramp back up and more of those barrels making their way to the West Coast, I think it takes some of the pressure off of the ANS. Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's Q&A session and I'd like to return the call to Mr. John Locke for any closing remarks. John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.: Thanks Andre and thanks everybody for calling in this morning. If you have any additional questions, please contact the IR team. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Homer Bhullar : Good morning. And welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you've not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it\u2019s says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the Company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that we completed another good quarter where we ran our business well and delivered solid financial results. Throughout the quarter, we maintained our unrelenting focus on operations excellence, which enabled us to operate safely and reliably in an environmentally responsible manner. We also delivered on our commitment to invest in growth projects and acquisitions that increased Valero's earnings capability while maintaining solid returns to our stockholders. In 2018, we matched 2017 record for process safety performance, and we continue to outperform the industry on our personal injury rates. Logistics investments we made over the last several years are contributing significantly to earnings. Our investments in Line 9B, the Diamond Pipeline and the Sunrise Pipeline expansion increased our system\u2019s flexibility, allowing us to take advantage of the opportunities available in the fourth quarter of 2018. In fact, we set a record for total light crude runs at 1.5 million barrels per day and a record for North American light crude processed at over 1.3 million barrels per day. We also continued to maximize products exports into higher netback markets in Latin America. Turning to capital allocation. We continue to execute according to our disciplined framework. Our projects and execution remain on track. Construction is scheduled to finish on the Houston alkylation unit in the second quarter. And the Central Texas pipelines and terminals are expected to be completed in mid-2019. In November, the Board of Directors of Valero and Darling Ingredients, approved an expansion of the Diamond Green Diesel plant to 675 million gallons per year of renewable diesel production and the construction of a renewable naphtha finishing facility. With respect to cash returns to stockholders in 2018, we paid out 54% of our annual adjusted net cash provided by operating activities, exceeding our target annual payout range of 40% to 50%. Our solid financial position and a favorable outlook for our business enabled us to further demonstrate our commitment to our investors, as last week, our Board approved a 12.5% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.90 per share or $3.60 annually. Lastly, earlier in January, we closed the acquisition of Valero Energy Partners. This transaction was immediately accretive and it's greatly simplified our structure. While Valero will no longer have a publicly traded midstream business, VLP\u2019s assets and ongoing logistics investments at Valero will continue to enhance our feedstock and product flexibility. Now, as we look ahead, we remain committed to our capital allocation framework. There has been no change in our capital discipline strategy, which prioritizes our investment grade ratings, sustaining investments and paying our dividends. We expect our annual CapEx for both 2019 and 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion, in line with where it's been over the last several years. And you should expect incremental discretionary cash flow to continue to compete with other discretionary uses, including cash returns, growth investments and M&A. In closing, with a growing economy, a year-over-year increase in vehicle miles traveled, and low fuel prices, we\u2019re encouraged for 2019. We expect good demand in domestic and exports markets this year. Despite seasonal weakness in the gasoline market, days of supply for distillate inventories remained below the five-year average. Expected incremental diesel demand and discounts for sour feedstocks associated with the impending global fuel oil sulfur reduction also give us a reason to remain optimistic. We believe that our system\u2019s flexibility to process a wide range of feedstocks and reliably supply quality fuels as evidenced by our fourth quarter 2018 results, positions Valero well for whatever opportunity the market presents to us. So, with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thank you, Joe. For the fourth quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $952 million or $2.24 per share compared to $2.4 billion or $5.42 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2018 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $900 million or $2.12 per share, compared to $509 million for $1.16 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. For 2018, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $3.1 billion or $7.29 per share, compared to $4.1 billion or $9.16 per share in 2017. 2018 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $3.2 billion or $7.37 per share, compared to $2.2 billion or $4.96 per share in 2017. The 2018 adjusted results exclude several items reflected in the financial tables that accompany this release, while the 2017 adjusted results exclude an income tax benefit of $1.9 billion from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For reconciliations of actual to adjust amounts, please refer to those financial tables. Operating income for the refining segment in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $1.5 billion, compared to $971 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 was mainly attributed to wider discounts for North American sweet crude and certain sour crudes relative to Brent, partly offset by weaker gasoline margins. Refining throughput volumes averaged 3 million barrels per day, which was in line with the fourth quarter of 2017. Throughput capacity utilization was 96% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.92 per barrel were $0.34 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2017, mostly due to higher natural gas costs in the fourth quarter of 2018. The ethanol segment generated $27 million operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $37 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease from 2017 was primarily due to lower margins, resulting from lower ethanol prices. Operating income for the VLP segment in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $88 million, compared to $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 was mainly due to contributions from the Port Arthur terminal assets and Parkway Pipeline, which were acquired in November 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2018, general and administrative expenses were $230 million and net interest expense was $114 million. General and administrative expenses for 2018 of $925 million were higher than 2017, mainly due to adjustments to our environmental liabilities. For the fourth quarter of 2018, depreciation and amortization expense was $531 million. And income tax expense, which includes certain income tax benefits, as reflected in the accompanying earnings release tables, was $205 million. Excluding these benefits, the effective tax rate was 21%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter-end, total debt was $9.1 billion, and cash and cash equivalents was $3 billion. Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 24% At the end of December, we had $4.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. We generated $1.7 billion of net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter. Excluding the unfavorable impact from a working capital decrease of approximately $120 million, net cash generated was $1.8 billion. With regard to investing activities, we made $771 million of growth and sustaining capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2018, of which $254 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. For 2018, we invested $2.7 billion of which approximately $1.9 billion was for sustaining and $800 million was for growth. Moving to financing activities. We returned $965 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter, $627 million was for the purchase of 7.7 million shares of Valero common stock and $338 million was paid as dividends. As of December 31st, we had approximately $2.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We expect capital investments for 2019 to be approximately $2.5 billion, with approximately 60% allocated to sustaining the business and approximately 40% to growth. Included in the total, our turnarounds, catalyst and joint venture investments. For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.67 million to 1.72 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 265,000 to 285,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 475,000 to 495,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.05 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.42 per gallon, which includes $0.06 for gallon for noncash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. For 2019, we expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $840 million. The annual effective tax rate is estimated at 23%. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $110 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $550 million. Lastly, we expect RIN\u2019s expense for the year to be between $400 million and $500 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Blake Fernandez with Simmons Energy. Your line is open. Blake Fernandez : Good morning, guys. Congrats on the stellar results. I appreciate the outlook for two years on CapEx. I think, there was some perception maybe with the project sanction last year that there would be upward pressure, and we're actually seeing a $200 million decrease year-over-year, and that sustained into 2020. Can you talk a little bit about where maybe some of that defilation has coming from, whether it's the growth component or sustaining or turnarounds? Lane Riggs : This is Lane. I wouldn't call it deflation, I would call that we had a -- we had a lot of sustaining capital with respect to Tier 3 and plus the reliability project at our Corpus Christi refinery in 2018. Our run rate is like what we've said is normally about $1.5 billion to sustain our assets. We had a little bit more than that in this past year. And there's obviously timing involved and all that. Whether our turnarounds get a little bit lumpy or again we end up having to do something a little bit special on some environmental, currently we don't have anything on our forward view of that. Blake Fernandez : Okay, great. The second question is on Venezuela, obviously very topical. I guess, one, could you confirm how much you're currently importing crude there? But then, I guess more importantly, I\u2019m just curious, in order to replace those barrels, are you looking to resort to more light sweet domestic crudes or just largely maxed out on light sweet to where you're actually going to have to resort to the global market for kind of medium and heavy sour replacement barrels? Thanks. Gary Simmons : Yes. Blake, this is Gary. Of course, with the sanctions, we're currently not taking anything from Venezuela. But, it was about 20% of our heavy sour that we run was Venezuelan barrels historically. We're certainly hopeful that we\u2019ll see proper resolution to the crisis, not only for the benefit of the crude markets but for the welfare of the people of Venezuela. We've seen production decline in Venezuela for years, and we've also known there was a threat of sanctions. So, we\u2019ve put alternatives in place to be prepared for this. Of course, the announcement was just made Monday; we've only had 48 hours to respond. Our top priority really has been to get to next 30-day supply plan covered. And I can tell you we're in a lot better position today than we were on Tuesday, but we still have some holes to fill in our supply plan. We really run Venezuelan barrels at two of our refineries in the Gulf, St. Charles and Port Arthur. The St. Charles refinery did begin a turnaround on their crude and coker unit. So, that definitely minimizes the impacts that the sanctions had on our system. To your point, current economics are certainly pushing us to maximize light sweet in the system. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with Evercore. Your line is open. Doug Terreson : I wanted to see if we could get some elaboration on Joe's points that you made a few minutes ago about market fundamental. And typically while distillate demand and inventories appear to be positive in both the U.S. and the Atlantic Basin, the converse seems true for gasoline, although seasonality and net exports should be supportive. And then, also, could you just spend a minute covering how fuel oil markets are likely to sort out this year, given the uncertainty that Blake just highlighted about Canada and Venezuela and heavy feedstocks and how you might adjust? Gary Simmons : Yes. This is Gary again. Of course, it seems like early in the year, during this call, we always are kind of panic on the gasoline markets. We feel very good about gasoline demand moving forward. high employment and low gasoline prices should result in good gasoline demand. The wild card of course becomes refinery utilization. So, with the 20-year high refinery utilization we saw last year, we are starting the year with a bit of an overhanging. The overhanging gasoline has primarily been PADD 1, PADD 2 and PADD 3. If I look at those regions individually, I could see that we build a little bit more inventory in PADD 1. The market structure is such that there's an economic incentive to make summer grade gasoline and put it in tankage in New York Harbor, and they're still tankage available. So, that would come. You could some inventory again in PADD 1. I think you'll see some significant improvements in both PADD 2 and PADD 3 moving forward. PADD 2, I think, a lot of the gasoline build was a result of the crude discount. The margins were just very strong. So, typically at PADD 2, you see refinery utilization drop off in the winter to balance the market. But with the crude discounts where, they ran hard. But if I look at the PADD 2 market now, there looks to be more planned maintenance this year than was last year. As we move forward and then currently with the cold snap hitting PADD 2, there seems to be quite a few refinery issues in that region. In fact, the Explorer Pipeline between group 3 and Chicago is now pro-rated, indicating there's a big pull for products in that region. So, I think you'll see gasoline inventories draw in PADD 2. And I also think you'll see some good gasoline draws in PADD 3 as well. Then, the Gulf, early in the year, we typically have fog issues which hinder our ability to export product, and we saw that again this year. We also saw a bottleneck trying to get gasoline into Mexico, which is obviously our largest export destination. And then, we saw a lot of refiner buying interest in the Gulf as well as people build some inventory in preparation for turnaround, so they could cover their supply during their outages. So, I think, all those things, as you see lower utilization in the Gulf as a result of planned maintenance beginning and you see exports pick up, I'm confident you'll see inventories in PADD 3 grow as well. So, I think we feel pretty good about gasoline. We feel very good about gasoline demand. And again, the wildcard is what utilization is going to be going forward. Doug Terreson : Okay. Any insight on fuel oil too? Gary Simmons : Yes, fuel oil. I think, it definitely is the issue you talk about. There has been a lot of significant hits to fuel on the supply side with OPEC cuts and the Iranian sanctions, now Venezuelan sanctions and production cuts in Western Canada. If you look at the forward curve on fuel oil, it's backward about $1 a month, and a lot of that is tied to the IMO 2020 fuel spec change. We do see fuel moving weaker as a result of lower demand for high sulfur fuel oil. And then, there's some signs that some of the production can be coming on. The Alberta government did announce that they're going to go ahead and raise production in February, at least 75,000 barrels day. So, some of those things will help as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is open. Paul Cheng : Hi. Good morning, guys. Before I ask my question, since that I told John Locke, if your Gulf Coast realized margin is going to be filed probably in excess of 650, I will publicly lobby Joe you to give Gary and his crude supply team a big bonus. So, I'm lobbying you. Gary Simmons : Paul, you're really helpful to me here. Paul Cheng : Anyway. So, other than that, two questions. First, looking at the current level in the fourth quarter, I mean, I think everyone is already trying to maximize on the distillate yield. So, in your system, is there any more that you can actually do that to shift from gasoline to distillate. And also, you said you're running a record 1.5 million barrels per day in the light oil. Is there any more that you can -- can you quantify that, how much more if there's any that you can actually move from medium and heavy into light? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, I would tell you on the gasoline to distillate swing, there's very little else we can do. We're pretty much maxed out on distillate today. On light crude, we would tell you that the numbers Joe gave you that was about 90% of our light sweet capacity. And so, there is some room there to push some additional light sweet crude into our system. Paul Cheng : So, Gary, you mean that if 90%, that means that at most you can push another 100,000, 150,000 barrel per day? Gary Simmons : Exactly. So, we've been saying we have about 1.6 million barrels a day of light sweet crude capacity. Paul Cheng : Secondly that do you expect the Mexico export that you're shipping there that you expect to increase in the coming weeks, given the fuel shortage there? If we look back in the last two months, have you seen any noticeable decline in your gasoline export to Mexico? Gary Simmons : No, we really haven't. Historically, we see a lot of buying interest in December from Mexico and we see these bottlenecks then trying to get the barrels into the country. And obviously, the crackdown on fuels made that even worse. We're seeing good demand from Mexico, not only waterborne barrels, but we continue to ramp up our business of actually importing the barrels into the country and we're seeing very good demand for barrels delivered all the way in the country as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Manav Gupta : Joe, congrats on a good quarter. And Homer, congrats on joining a great team. We will all miss John Locke and would like to wish him all the best in his new role. So, I just have a quick question on Diamond Green Diesel expansion. Like, if you look at the current margins, is it fair to assume that this is like a 35-plus-percent return for project for you? And the second follow-up on it is, what advantage does Darling Ingredients brings to the table? Are they just a financial partner or they give you some kind of competitive edge on your peers, who are also trying similar projects? Martin Parrish : This is Martin. On Diamond Green, we're looking at historically -- we think going forward, we're going to be at about $1.25 a gallon, so doing the math, you\u2019re probably in the right ballpark with that return on EBITDA margins. Now, Darling is not just a financial partner. Darling processes about 10% of the world\u2019s meat byproduct. They also do a significant work on collecting used cooking oil. They've been in these markets for years. Diamond Green, we've been in this fat market for 5 years now, 5.5 years, they've been in for a long time. They bring a lot to the table around sourcing the fat pre-treating the fat for the unit. So, it's a really good synergy here. We've got a refining expertise, we've got expertise in marketing a product, they've got pre-treatment expertise and bringing the fat into the joint venture. So, it's a really good partnership. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Doug Leggate : Joe, you guys do a great job of making the sell side look really dumb every quarter; it\u2019s a great quarter, obviously. But my question is a $30 correction in oil prices, obviously there's some lag effect in your capture rate. I'm just curious as to the capture rate move that we saw and off of 100% on our numbers is running about 30%, 40% above what you would normally deliver. Was that just lag effect, or is there something structural going on such as the shift to the lighter grades that we should pay more attention to going forward? Gary Simmons : Doug, that's a good question. Joe Gorder : Why don\u2019t I take a shot at it and Gary for recal -- retune whatever I'm saying here. But there is really a few -- couple of reasons. One is as we alluded to in the opening remarks, we've had the pipeline projects. We have the Line 9 and we had the Diamond Pipeline and the Sunrise. And all of those put up the position in the Mid-Continent and in our Quebec refinery position us to take advantage of essentially the distressed markets in the fourth quarter. And then, the other side of that is on the product side, really lower rent price, allowed us to capture essentially higher net-backs on our product prices. I'm sure, there's a contribution on the other things, like pet coke, all the stuff to contribute our capture rate. But really, the first two things that really drove our capture rate in the fourth quarter. Doug Leggate : So, should we consider that the capture rate is structurally moving higher? Joe Gorder : I would say, you should -- on the product side with the lower rent prices, yes. On the crude side, it's just a matter of how distressed those markets are. And you have a line -- you have a view of what [indiscernible] looks like and a view of what Midland looks like and Cushing. Doug Leggate : Okay. Thank you for trying to answer that. I know it was tough one. My follow-up is really -- is kind of a follow-up to the Doug Terreson\u2019s question, I guess. Normally, we would see this -- the industry pivot obviously between distillate and gasoline to some extent, as you move through the summer, but obviously we've got this IMO even going into 2020. So, I'm wondering, is there a possibility that we see Valero specifically maintain a max distillate bias through the whole of 2019 as one part of the solution to the gasoline overhang? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Lane Riggs : This is Lane again. We absolutely believe that it\u2019ll be the case. I mean, we've been in max distillate for a while now and will continue to be in that way through the at least the way we see the rest of the year going in 2019. Obviously, it\u2019s early but that's the way the forward market is pointing right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is open. Prashant Rao : Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back to crude sourcing and drill down a little bit, obviously really strong performance there. And as Paul said, it makes us all look we underestimated you this quarter. On the Maya or other Central American heavy sours, I just want to get a confirmation? I mean, lot of those grades have priced themselves out of the market we saw in 4Q. But were you -- what was your purchasing like in for 4Q and is it -- were you not running as much and should -- how should we expect that to look now that we some price normalization as we go forward in 1Q? Gary Simmons : So, I think on the heavy side, we've definitely seen that Maya is probably not the best marker for what we're paying for a heavy sour crude. So, in the fourth quarter, if you look Maya was priced at 4.50 discount to Brent. WCS or Western Canadian Select in the U.S. Gulf Coast was trading at a $10.60 discount to Brent. And we believe that the Canadian quote was much more representative of our actual delivered heavy sour into the system. In addition to that, then there were certainly some things with the connect -- disconnect in western Canadian pricing. We had a significant uplift on the crude by rail, we did 43,000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian by rail in Port Arthur, and those were very discounted barrels. Prashant Rao : Okay, thanks. And I guess that sort of leads nicely to my second question. My follow-up is on the Canadian barrels. It year-to-date seems like the import data and purchasing data, what we've heard the market is -- you continue to be able to get good access to those Canadian barrels. Just wondering if you could give some color on the sourcing, especially given that we've had production cuts up in Canada with the dynamics of those barrels also coming in by rail, or are there more available in the market, just any color on how we should think about the variety of sourcing there? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, in the fourth quarter, we also set a record on the volume of Canadian heavy that we ran in our system. We ran over 180,000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian. And it is sourced via pipe, delivered into the Gulf, and then we do about 40,000 barrels a day crude by rail. Our view is that crude by rail will be necessary until one of the major pipeline projects gets approved out of western Canada. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Roger Read : I guess, maybe to dig in a little deeper, thinking about the summer time here with gasoline. So, you're running max distillate, presumably most if not all the industry is doing the same. So, if we see, relatively speaking, weaker gasoline cracks this summer, does that imply that to get things in balance effectively, the industry has to employ run cuts or should we think about additional toggles you can do, if you ended up with a summertime situation with stronger distillate cracks relative to the gasoline, especially with IMO staring us in the face by the latter part of the summer? Joe Gorder : Roger, it\u2019s difficult to answer, certainly thinking of the gasoline situation is a combination of yield, which certainly we expect to be in the max distillate mode. And then, the other thing I\u2019d refer to is just what the utilization rate and the refining capacity is, and whether that 20-year high that we saw last year is sustainable. Roger Read : Yes. I mean, I would think though with this -- with more light barrels available, there's no reason to think U.S. refines throughout have come off. It\u2019s strictly a margin decision. We heard others companies, other refiners talk about different things you can do in terms of how hard you run your FCC units versus other decisions you can make. I was just curious, if there's anything like that that occurs for IMO as your look at your overall system? Lane Riggs : This is Lane. I'll take a stab at that. So, we do -- FCC is obviously a pivotal part of our operation, and there's certain inflection point, economic inflection point. And it almost always makes sense fill our alky. So, we\u2019ll run up to the point to make sure alkylation units are full. And so, the marginal capacity we're always looking is to make sense to run-pass that point. And to your point, interestingly enough, the stream that we put in these out also can go into the fuel market for the halfway percent to meet the IMO reg. So, we do think structurally at least one of the things that will happen here is that FCC probably won\u2019t run a whole lot pass, drilling their alky, it\u2019s certainly in the context of how IMO 2020 is going to work out. Roger Read : And then, Joe, you\u2019ve done a great job over the years here in terms of capital allocation. The decision to roll up VLP kind of brings the balance sheet more into like the true issue on cash and that as opposed to the non-recourse side. I was wondering, as you think about future capital allocation, is there anything you want to do on the balance sheet? Is there a goal to reduce debt here or maybe to increase kind of future flexibility, if you were to pursue anything on the acquisition front? Joe Gorder : Roger, that's a good question. I would say generally, there isn't anything that we're expecting to change. We set the target within the capital allocation framework debt-to-cap of 20% to 30% range. Donna has got kind of a minimum cash balance target $2 billion, things like that. Those are just things that we operate with is fundamental assumption day in and day out as we go forward. We get asked periodically about, somebody raised the issue about the sustainability of the dividend. And, that's a really interesting question to come up at this point in time. Because in October, we were all being asked what we were going to do with all the cash that IMO 2020 was going to provide. So, that being said, I think when I look at Valero, I realize that we understand our business and we're making decisions for the long-term based on our strategic view of the market and not hype. And so, we always try to position ourselves financially to be able to deal with whatever the market might be giving us.  So, if we think in terms of dividend, for example, I can just say without reservation that we consider a sustaining CapEx and the dividend to be totally non-discretionary, and we're going to defend them as we allocate cash. We got a really strong balance sheet, and we certainly wouldn't have raised the dividend if we thought sustainably was any kind of issue there. And really, that's it around that. From an acquisition perspective, we'll continue to review them in the context of growth projects. And, when you think in terms of the roll up of VLP, it kind of takes you to the question, well, are you going to continue to invest in logistics projects going forward? And the answer to that would be, yes, to the extent the same benefits Valero's business. And if you recall, even with VLP is a publicly traded entity, we always started with a need at Valero. And then, if we did the project to satisfy that need at VLP and take VLP at 12% rate of return, would it still makes sense for Valero to do the project? Okay. That was kind of the calculus that we went through. And if it was yes, we proceeded. Now, we just look at these projects as an aggregate project. So, the Diamond Pipeline for example, we have a huge benefit on the crude sourcing in the Memphis as a result of the Diamond Pipeline, and VLP was getting the 12% rate of return. Now, all that's rolled in to one set of economics and we look at it in the context of 25% rates of return on refining projects. So, the way we structured the framework, it's flexible enough to allow us to adjust a little bit from time to time, but it hasn't fundamentally changed what we're doing and what we're focused on. So that was a really long answer to a pretty simple question, Roger. So sorry about that. Roger Read : No, I appreciate that. I just can't believe you accused Wall Street to be in fickle... Joe Gorder : Yes. I know it's hard to imagine. Isn\u2019t it? Roger Read : Absolutely. All right. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Phil Gresh : First question, Joe, would be, you talked for a couple of years now about the illustrative EBITDA that you can generate from these projects that you have under way. And, I think in your slides, you talked about $175 million incremental for 2018 from completed projects. So, I'm wondering how you think about that ramp in 2019 and 2020 that we should be thinking about from the projects underway? Joe Gorder : Well, we haven't been that explicit in giving EBITDA forecast for \u201819 and \u201820, right? And I don't think we're going to go there. I think, what you've got to rely on really, Phil, is, is the chart we got in the slide deck. And, if you look at our return threshold for our projects, and you say you're going to invest this much strategic capital year-in and year-out, what kind of EBITDA do you expected to produce? And our numbers are $1 billion to $1.4 billion. And that includes the benefit of the coker project, of our ownership interest in DGD, of all the pipeline to terminal projects going on, the alky and so on. And we're still very, very comfortable with those numbers. And so, in terms of moving the needle from an EBITDA perspective in light of our capital allocation framework and the clear recognition that capital is a finite resource, we're going to invest in it accordingly, and the projects we're targeting are going to produce $1 billion to $1.5 billion of incremental EBITDA. Phil Gresh : Okay, fair enough. Second question is just coming back to your comment on the minimum cash balances. If I take your ending 2018, take out $915 million for the VLP volume in the first quarter, I think you're kind of around that $2 billion level. I realize working capital has also been a pretty big headwind in 2018. So, trying to think about that, is there some kind of perhaps reversal that could happen with crude oil prices now going back up? And just generally wondering how you think about that, in the context of the capital return plans and things of that nature? Joe Gorder : That's a good questions. Donna, do you want to\u2026? Donna Titzman : Sure. So, in regards to the working capital, I mean, yes. So, to the extent prices would go up, you would see a shift in the more positive direction in 2019. A lot of the negative working capital that you saw in 2018 had to do with some timing on the capital wins that were really due in \u201817 that were pushed to 2018. So, that has sort of evened itself out. But certainly, there are some other movements in the working capital in 2018 that could reverse themselves. Phil Gresh : And then, just in terms of VLP taking that down to $2 billion cash balance. So, I mean, you\u2019re basically saying that you\u2019re kind of at the levels you want to manage that or is there flexibility around that $2 billion or how do you think about that target? Donna Titzman : Clearly, that was a big amount of cash going out in January. But, we're going to continue to make money, generate cash. And so, you should see the cash balance recover. But, again, we're at that $2 billion minimum; we are comfortable here at that level. Joe Gorder : Phil, I mean, we\u2019ve said this for years now. We never -- our plan was not to carry $5 billion of cash quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter. And we were just finding ourselves in that situation. And so, there was an intentional plan here to try to tighten this down a little bit. Now, Donna has got our target set. She is the CFO and we're going to try to abide by the target. But, there's no reason for us to sit here with $5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Neil Mehta : So, Joe, team, I just wanted to start talk a little bit here about IMO 2020. It's funny, we're 40 minutes since the call and it's got a lot less tense than probably six months ago, which is a reflection perhaps of what you've seen in the forward curve where we\u2019ve seen diesel FO; while it's still favorable, has compressed in 2020, 2021. As you look at this dynamic of IMO 2020, has anything changed in the team's mind about the potential upside from it? And just can you talk about how you see it playing itself out through the markets and the sustainability of that tailwind? Gary Simmons : Sure, Neil. This is Gary. I don't think our view of what will transpire as a result of IMO 2020 has really changed at all. We still see that you'll see a significant uptick in diesel demand and you'll see weakness in the high sulfur fuel oil markets. The shape of the high sulfur fuel curve is pretty much as we assumed it would be. The starting point is a little higher with high sulfur fuel oil trading 94% of Brent today, but you still see steep backwardation in high sulfur fuel oil curve. I think, the one to us that we keep staring at is the ULSD forward curve really isn't showing any IMO impact at all. And we still believe there will be significant demand increases as a result of IMO and strong diesel cracks as a result of that as you approach that January 2020 date. Neil Mehta : I appreciate that. And then, the other follow-up and that will be about good -- is RINs, just your thoughts on that market. Again, it seems like something we haven't paid as much attention to lately, prices have been lower for a period of time here. Is there any risk that you see in the RINs market that could send prices higher, and just your thoughts on how it plays out from here? Jason Fraser : Yes. This is Jason. Just from a policy side, we don't see any seismic shift come in. I mean, the EPA has several rule-makings. They\u2019re looking at the E15 waiver for the upcoming summer for the ethanol guys to give more ability to put more in the market, tied with the market reform aspects. Some rules have been hopefully improved the functioning of the RIN market within RFS reset. But, what's happened is those have all gotten stalled out with the government shutdown. So, we don't see any change in course, more just a delay right now, but I don't see any big catalyst to change things. Lane Riggs : And then, the small refiner exemption is another piece of this, right? And the EPA followed the rules last year and got a small refiner exemptions where they were appropriate. And that certainly took some of the pressure off the RIN market also. We expect them to continue to follow the rules to comply with the legislation as it's crafted and issue the small refiner exemptions where they are appropriate. And so, Neil, I'm with Jason. I don't see a whole of change in this market going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Mizuho. Your line is open. Paul Sankey : Joe, this is good result obviously in Q4, but it feels like a tremendous number of things have changed into Q1 equally, so that your comments about gasoline for example. It's not a good time in January to sort of turn bearish. Can you talk a little bit about what the really big earnings impact changes have been? And obviously, I'm thinking about OPEC cuts, Alberta cuts, Venezuela, gasoline markets. It's just a very different environment. How do you expect things to progress in some of those things through 2019, and how different is the environment even in January compared to this very good result in Q4? Thanks. Joe Gorder : So, Paul, I mean, that's a very good question. And you hit on the point. I mean, it is a very interesting market because there are so many moving parts right now. But, the thing that we always have to keep in mind is that January always stinks. Gasoline is usually weak at this point in time. If the winter is warm, distillates not too salty. A lot of times, Paul, we've been at your conference in the past in January when everybody wanted to slip their risk because things were so miserable. Right? But the reality is, is that we're managing our business for the long term. And we have been in this for a very long time and we understand the cycles in the business. And so what do you do? You make adjustments day-in and day-out in your operations to try to deal with this and to be as profitable as possible. I mean, Lane mentioned some of the things we'll do around cash. Gary has changed in the way he's sourcing crude, on a weekly, daily basis to try to get the best net-back that we can in the plant. The things that we don't change. We don't change our commitment to the things that make Valero really good, which is operating safely, reliably, honoring environmental stewardship, managing our capital appropriately. Those are the things we can control and that we pay a lot of attention to. Day-in and day-out optimization based on certain market conditions, okay, we're all over that too. But, we don't have a crystal ball. And so we just manage the business for the long-term and we do our best. Lane, you or Gary, want to talk any specifics around that? Lane Riggs : One thing I would add on Venezuela, Venezuela at some point going to have to put oil on the market, even if these sanctions stay in place. So, there's going to be a balancing time through here where whoever buy any alternatives, they'll build buy Venezuelan oil and oil will come to our market. So, I mean, it will also allow you just sort of in a interim time period here where that's got to play out. And of course, if something changes in Venezuela, then it's just back to status quo. On OPEC, OPEC is clearly going to be looking at trying to set the amount of oil in the market based on what are the markets and what's the structure of the market. And again, as Joe alluded to, every day we wake up and we do -- we optimize our assets around what's available out there. We have a great system better than anyone in the markets to get the most value and understand these markets. Paul Sankey : Great. Thanks, guys. And Joe, I greatly appreciate, shot out for our January refining conference. Saying that you are the only major refining out there this year, but do you remember that we've got our -- don't forget we've got our Napa Valley Energy Summit on the 1st and 2nd of April, and you're most welcome to join us in [Multiple speakers]. Apologies for the shameless plug. Joe Gorder : Paul, I would expect nothing less. And if you are buying, all I can see, we can make it work. Paul Sankey : I appreciate that, guys. Thanks very much indeed. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Paul. Take care. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brad Heffern : Lane, I was just hoping you could sort of expand on the comments that you just made about crude sourcing. I mean, it seems like all the numbers we see on the screen for pretty much anything sour waterborne, it's just not the math that you would normally expect. So, is Mars at minus 2 or Oriente at minus 4? Are those crudes actually pricing their way into the system or is there a chance that in the sort of interim period where the trade routes are sort of getting really drawn that we see cut and runs just because the mediums and the heavies are not competitive? Lane Riggs : So, I'll take a shot at it and Gary obviously can tune me. Today, where we are is the most profitable crude that we run is our sweets. And then, it's sort of medium and heavy, you are sort of at parity with one another. And it depends on what part of your refinery is trying to sellout. But on the Mars, like the last barrels we try to run on the system where it's really sweet and they all still have margin, positive margin to an open crude unit. So, it's just really trying to navigate and get the right dive into our assets. In terms of just the way trade routes are deploying. I think, again, as I said, I mean, OPEC cuts, they aren't always going to be cuts. And we got to watch how Venezuela plays out on the sanction side. It's just like what happens when around, same thing. So, these all worked, they're not the permanent trade we pass, but the world rebalances when these things happen. Brad Heffern : And then, I was just wondering if you could give any color on your union contracts. Obviously, the steel workers union negotiations going on right now and the contract expires tomorrow. So, I know you guys didn't have any impact four years ago, the last time that we saw this, but just curious if what do you expect this time around. Joe Gorder : Sure. So, Shell is really negotiating on behalf of the industry for the pattern bargaining. In terms of Valero, we have two refineries, I think actually tonight at 12 midnight that these contracts expire. And we have two refineries that these contracts will expire that is our Memphis refinery and Port Arthur. We have a tentative agreement with our Memphis refinery right now in terms of just sort of local agreement, pending the sort of the Shell negotiations. And we're still working on our issues at Port Arthur. We don't expect a work stoppage during this whole process, but you just never know. So, we're prepared for that. We have a completely trained temporary workforce to take over the assets in the event that there is a walk out. But, I'm not trying to say we're going have one, but we're certainly prepared for it, as you would expect us to be. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. Craig Shere : So, picking up on Neil's IMO 2020 question. I just wonder if you could speak to the expanding wastewater regulations that appear to be limiting the option of ship-based scrubbers. Lane Riggs : Hi. This is Lane. I think what you're asking about, there are some of these environment -- there are some sort of ports that are saying they're not allowing the discharges. Is that what you are talking about? Craig Shere : Exactly. Lane Riggs : Yeah. So, again, that just makes it a little more difficult for the ships to invest in scrubbers. I mean, again the technology takes the SOX out of the air and puts it into the water. And I think some of these local ports are fully aware of that. It's just another headwind in terms of making it more difficult to try to solve this long range problem out of IMO, which is this really heavy bitumen that's historically been burning these ships and there's only a few other pathway to try to get rid of it. And as Gary mentioned, that's where you really see the forward market trying to understand exactly how it's going to happen is that particular strength. Craig Shere : So, would you agree that that's just another data point suggesting a perhaps deeper and more prolonged benefit to the refineries? Lane Riggs : Exactly. That's exactly right. Craig Shere : And also, just picking up on Roger's M&A balance sheet question. 2018 was a robust acquisition year. We had the ethanol plants, the Peruvian terminaling and the VLP rollup obviously. Do you think that convergence was just a one-off event or do you see ongoing opportunities that can continue to soak up cash balance? Joe Gorder : Craig, I mean, our practice is not to really kind of foretell what we're looking at from a acquisition perspective. But, I can tell you, there is nothing on the radar screen at this point in time. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities as they arise, but we don't have any pressing need to fix our business sort of fill that gap with acquired assets. I can't call it coincidental, because we made the decision to do the acquisitions last year, right? So, it's far from a coincidence. But the facts are we saw some opportunities that we felt satisfied our strategic interest, and that really was to extend our supply chain and to continue to grow one of our businesses, the ethanol business, buying assets that were priced very-attractively in the market. And so, we took advantage of the opportunity. But, I'm going to tell you there -- I would not model for a repeat act in 2019. Craig Shere : So, barring ongoing strong M&A and relatively steady billion dollar growth CapEx, robust margins like we're seeing and the opportunity for IMO 2020, it seems like if anything is going to flex, it's going to be the share buybacks, which we saw in the fourth quarter? Joe Gorder : Yes, sir. Craig Shere : Okay, good. Thank you very much. Joe Gorder : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open. Matthew Blair : Homer, did you say 3.8 on ethanol throughput guidance for Q1? And if so, does that reflect any economic run cuts or maybe a big turnaround or something else going on? Martin Parrish : Well, this is Martin Parrish. Yes, we have cut back a little bit or run in all our plants, so we had some cut back a little bit. There's just not much fund in it right now. But, we take a long-term view and we expect things to turn around. Ethanol demand in the U.S. is going to grow marginally, and export demand way up this year, and we expect that to continue, it's more mandates worldwide, and even better than that just blending economics worldwide for ethanol where it's priced. And we just don't think that can stay that way where ethanol prices is cheap. So, that's the plan. Matthew Blair : And then, I was also hoping you could talk about Octane in upcoming alky expansion. When we look at Gulf Coast octane spreads coming in around $5 a barrel, a couple of years ago that was more like $10 to $12 a barrel. So, is the alky unit -- what are the economics on today's pricing, and would you expect a widening octane spread going forward? Lane Riggs : This is Lane. So, our Houston alky will come on stream in the second quarter. Our FID decision, I think, the EBITDA will come around 105 million or something like that. So, I'd have to go back and look and see where compare now. But, we are still committed with the idea that A, going forward octane is going to be more valuable. There's a couple of reasons for that. One is the auto is going higher octane; and two, you still haven't seen tier 3. All this tier 3 investment get in and sort of potentially pressure the octane. And then, finally, just all this light crude puts a lot in that out there. So, all that put together, essentially, we believe that octane is going to be valuable. Where it is versus our funding decisions, where we just have to check, but we still feel like it's a good project. And the same true for our St. Charles, Alkylation project. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Weiland with US Capital Advisors. Your line is open. Craig Weiland : Yes. Hi. Good morning, and thank you for fitting my question, and congrats on the great quarter. You have about a quarter of your Gulf Coast refining capacity located in Eastern Louisiana. And it looks like probably bridge is about to start up here, start delivering barrels into St. James at some point, maybe this quarter, also a slew of other proposed projects that have been introduced in recent weeks and months, designed to move crude into that market over the next couple of years. So, I'm curious, if you could elaborate on how you think Valero's crude procurement options will develop on the back of these projects and what type of impact they could have on your Gulf Coast feedstocks. I appreciate any color you can share. Gary Simmons : Yes. I think, the biggest thing for us in the eastern Gulf is St. Charles is obviously a heavy sour refinery, and getting better access to heavy Canadian crude would be a big advantage for us there. And so, we're certainly looking at some of the projects that are out there, namely the Capline reversal has a potential to be able to get more cost effective heavy sour crude in to St. Charles is a big benefit to our system. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Your line is open. Jason Gabelman : Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Just a couple of questions. A follow-up on the comments about running the FCCs, just to maximize alky production. The inputs into the FCCs, are those able to be blended into the marine fuel pool, or is there from a technical standpoint, an issue with meeting marine fuel specs, if you try to blend that backing gas oil into the marine pool? Lane Riggs : Hey, Jason. This is Lane. So, yes, the fees, particularly the marginal fee which is low sulfur VGO into these FCCs will fit into the half-a-way percent fuel oil market. Jason Gabelman : Okay, great. And there's not an issue with any of the other specs outside of meeting the sulfur spec? Lane Riggs : We've done a lot of work in terms of blends, making sure that there's some compatibility. There is not -- the spec for is not that rigorous. It really ends up being -- there's just sulfur spec. So, really what you really got to be careful of is for something that you do to the blend that creates compatibility. I'm pretty confident, ultimately, industry will work through all that. It's not to say that really on there won't be some of those issues. We've worked with some of these people to try to work on our own blends around that. So, that's really the only issue this potentially could have. Jason Gabelman : And just looking more near term, obviously 4Q benefited from some better capture than anticipated and trying to figure out if that could continue into the first quarter. One area I think where there could be some upside is on the butane blending. It looks like butane prices have fallen pretty hard against where gasoline prices are. Do you expect that to support capture rates in the first quarter relative to its support in prior first quarters? Gary Simmons : Yes. We see the spread. But, it's not a real meaningful contribution to our overall earnings for the quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Homer Bhullar for closing remarks. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Shannon. We appreciate everyone joining us. Please feel free to contact the IR team, if you have any additional questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference maybe recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Homer Bhullar. Sir, please go ahead. Homer Bhullar : Good morning everyone. And welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you've not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our Web site at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it's says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks Homer and good morning everyone. Our system is flexibility and the teams relentless focus on safety enable us to deliver positive earnings in an otherwise weak margin environment during a period of heavy maintenance. The first quarter presented us with tough market conditions, differentials on medium and heavy sour crude oils were compressed by a number of factors including OPEC and Canadian crude production curtailments and Venezuelan sanctions. We also started the year with gasoline inventories at record high levels and the gasoline crack at historic lows. Despite this challenging backdrop our premier assets and prior investments that have improved our feedstock and product flexibility enable us to achieve positive earnings and operating cash flow. We demonstrated the flexibility of our system by processing a record volume of 1.4 million barrels per day of North American sweet crude oil as well as a record amount of Canadian heavy crude in the quarter. The Diamond Pipeline and Line 9B continued to provide cost advantage Cushing and Canadian crudes to the Memphis and the Quebec City refineries respectively. We also continue to maximize product exports into higher net back markets in Latin America. Our investments that are expected to grow the earnings capability of the company continue to move forward. The Houston alkylation unit and the Central Texas pipelines and terminals projects remain on track to be operational in the second and third quarters respectively. The Pasadena terminal, St. Charles alkylation unit and Pembroke cogeneration unit are all on track to be complete in 2020. The Diamond Green Diesel expansion and the Port Arthur Coker are expected to be complete late 2021 and 2022 respectively. Turning to capital allocation, we continue to adhere to our discipline framework. Our annual CapEx for both 2019 and 2020 remains at approximately 2.5 billion and you should expect incremental discretionary cash flow to continue to compete with other discretionary uses including cash returns, growth investments and M&A. With respect to cash returns to stockholders, we paid out 55% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter and we continue to target an annual payout ratio between 40% to 50%. Turning to financing activities, we completed a $1 billion public debt offering in March at a coupon of 4% with the proceeds being used primarily to redeem $850 million, 6.125% senior notes due in 2020. We also funded the buy in of VLP with $950 million of cash on hand in the first quarter. Now, [Technical Difficulty] we remain constructive for the rest of the year. Product fundamentals continue to improve with gasoline and distillate inventories now below their 5-year averages. Additionally product shortages particularly in Central and South America should continue to support robust exports. The impending IMO 2020 fuel oil specs should also lead to higher gasoline and distillate cracks along with improvement in the medium and heavy sour crude differentials. Our advantage footprint with its flexibility to process a wide range of feedstocks and reliably supply quality fuels to consumers here and abroad coupled with a relentless focus on operations excellence and a demonstrated commitment to stockholders continues to position Valero well for any market environment. So with that Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks Joe. For the first quarter of 2019 net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $141 million or $0.34 per share compared to $469 million or $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter 2018 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $431 million or $1 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts please refer to the financial tables that accompany this release. Operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2019 was $479 million compared to $811 million for the first quarter of 2018. The decrease from first quarter of 2018 was mainly attributed to significantly weaker gasoline margins and narrower medium and heavy sour crude differentials. Refining throughput volume averaged 2.9 million barrels per day which was lower than the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to maintenance activities. Throughput capacity utilization was 91% in the first quarter of 2019. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.15 per barrel or $0.32 per barrel higher than the first quarter of 2018 mostly due to maintenance related expenses and lower throughput in the first quarter of 2019. The Ethanol segment generated $3 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $45 million in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease from first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to lower ethanol prices. Ethanol production volumes averaged $4.2 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2019 an increase of 104,000 gallons per day versus the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to added production from the three ethanol plants acquired in November 2018. As noted in the earnings release we are reporting the renewable diesel segment beginning this quarter. The segments generated $49 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $195 million in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the adjustments shown in the accompanying earnings release tables related to the 2017 blenders tax credit recorded in early 2018, first quarter 2018 adjusted operating income was $35 million. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 790,000 gallons per day in the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 419,000 gallons per day versus the first quarter of 2018. The adjusted operating income and sales volumes increased from the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to the expansion of the Diamond Green Diesel plant in the third quarter of 2018. For the first quarter of 2019, general and administrative expenses were $209 million and net interest expense was $112 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $551 million and income tax expense was $51 million in the first quarter of 2019. The effective tax rate was 23%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $10.1 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $2.8 billion. Valero debt to capitalization ratio after giving effect to the redemption of the 815 million senior notes occurring today was 26%. At the end of March, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity excluding cash. We generated $877 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter excluding the favorable impact from a working capital increase of approximately $130 million net cash generated was $747 million. With regard to investing activities, we made $726 million of capital investments in the first quarter of 2019 of which $453 million was for sustaining the business including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance. Moving to financing activities, we returned $411 million to our stockholders in the first quarter; $375 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 414,000 shares of Valero common stock. The total payout ratio was 55% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. As of March 31, we had approximately $2.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to expect annual capital investments for both 2019 and 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion, with approximately 60% allocated to sustaining the business and approximately 40% to growth. Included in that amount are turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.72 million to 1.77 million barrels per day. U.S. Mid-Continent at 425,000 to 445,000 barrels per day. U.S. West Coast at 220,000 to 240,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $4 per barrel. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4.7 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volume to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2019. Operating expenses in 2019 should be $0.45 per gallon which includes $0.16 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For 2019, we continue to expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $840 million. The annual effective tax rate is still estimated at 23%. For the second quarter net interest expense should be about $115 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $560 million. Lastly, we expect RIN's expense for the year to be between $300 million and $400 million which is approximately $100 million lower than the previous guidance primarily due to lower RIN's prices. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. ClayAugumini: Hey, good morning guys. This is Clay on for Doug. Thanks for taking my question. I've got a one and a follow up. I really want to talk about the gasoline rally recently. When you had to deconstruct them in the recent move higher seasonality and constraint have played a big role and both of these are non-discretionary. And what I think the market is worried about and why the rally has stalled is that the potential for industry utilization to ramp up and kill the crack. So what I'm hoping that you could speak to and help us understand? Or maybe some of the factors that could keep this from happening in particular, I'm looking at the Inland spreads and the quality spreads on the water and because of this I think I have a hard time believing that there is the incentive to next run. And maybe we got a glimpse of this on your fourth quarter where throughput was within guidance and not ahead which has been the case recently. And I guess, if this point is true then maybe this rally has a bit more durability than people think. Joe Gorder : Gary you want to. Gary Simmons : Yes, sure. Well, I can tell you its a lot more fun talking about gasoline in April than it was in January and we certainly feel good about the gasoline market. When we talk in January as you mentioned we were looking at a year-over-year overhang of 18 million barrels of gasoline. Since that time, since February we've seen refiner utilization average 87%. Now gasoline inventory is 11 million below where it was last year at this time. In addition to that, you're heading into a portion of the year where we would expect seasonal demand trends to follow where we'd see a pickup in demand as you head into driving season. In addition to that you should see yield fall-off some as we're transitioning to summer grade gasoline. You have less butane in the pool. So, I think through driving season, we feel very good about the gasoline situation as you get into the fourth quarter we would expect if you would see some normal seasonal patterns there as well and you begin to build inventory. I think this year, we do feel like there is an opportunity on gasoline that we haven't seen before because of the IMO 2020 bunker spec change. Our view is that low sulfur feedstocks are currently going to SECs where we priced against their low sulfur fuel blend value alternative and that ability to swing the low sulfur feedstocks out of the SECs and into the low sulfur fuel market will be supportive to the cracks longer term as it results in lower SEC utilization and lower gasoline production. But when it comes to gasoline or all aspects of the business, we manage for the long-term there's certainly a lot of moving parts here, but we feel like we're very well positioned. Global demand remains healthy. Valero is the lowest cost producer and we're strategically located export product globally especially to the markets in Central and South America. So we feel pretty good about it. ClayAugumini: Got it. And this is a follow-up looking at the screen today, gasoline cracks and diesel cracks seems to have finally converged. What does this mean for your [indiscernible] this summer, do you still have these signals remain in next [indiscernible] mode? Joe Gorder : This he hasn't answered. Gary Simmons : Okay. So we're swinging -- we have swung the heavy cat naphtha into gasoline. ClayAugumini: Thanks Gary. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Prashant Rao : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to talk about the crude side. Joe, you mentioned a strong -- taking strong advantage of Canadian crudes on the heavy side and here we're also seeing Maya setting the discount a bit more so. I wanted two parts to this question, one wanted to know kind of a check on how much Canadian you were running in the quarter and what your thoughts are going forward? And then, two, any thoughts on the recent sort of reversion and discounting on Maya and how that might play out as we go through the year? Joe Gorder : Yes. Prashant, good question. Gary, you and Lane want to take. Gary Simmons : Yes. So we did just under 190,000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian, 49 of that was crude by rail that we delivered to Port Arthur with the remainder being pipeline delivered barrels. We would expect those volumes to continue in that range actually ramp up a little bit especially with the Venezuelan barrels off of the market. On the Maya formula, there's not a lot of help in terms of additional medium and heavy sour supply coming onto the market, but where we see the opportunity for the quality dips to improve is really heavy, high sulfur fuel moving weaker. And we came off the highs, where we were trading at 96% of Brent. Earlier this week, we were down to 89% of Brent. And our expectation is as you move closer to that IMO 2020 fuel spec change that high sulfur fuel would continue to get weaker and that will help the quality discounts move weaker as well. Prashant Rao : All right. Thank you. Appreciate that. And then, the follow up I guess [Technical Difficulty] on feedstock side and maybe switching over to Diamond Green Diesel. Looking at what kind of underlying profitability, it looks like feedstock cost there being able to get not only profitable even before the low sulfur fuel, let me say low carbon fuel credit before the blenders credit as well. I kind of want to just get a sense of strategy and how things have developed in terms of the diversity of feedstock sourcing how that, what it takes to build up that network and sort of progress along those lines it looks like there's been some solid progress over the last -- obviously, for several years, but now that you are disclosing it as a separate segment kind of wanted to think about how we should look at that longer term of this year and further on. Martin Parrish : Okay. Well, this is Martin. We've provided volume guidance today on an annual basis. We're also going to be publishing a DGD margin indicator on our Web site. We've been running at these higher rates now for six months feedstock is flowing fine. Our partnership with Darling Ingredients gives us an advantage in that space. They process about 10% of the world's meat byproducts. So we feel good about being able to source the feedstock. And looking forward to continued growth and expansion and we're looking at this expansion that Joe mentioned additional 400 million gallons a year that'll come on in late 2021. Prashant Rao : And in terms of sort of beyond just the soybean indicator that you've given us sort of wondering if we could give it more color on how diversified we could get if you're able to share anything. I know that you've heard in other parts of the globe, if there's a lot of ingenuity in terms of what can be used as feedstock source. So I was just curious along maybe in those lines if you if you know how diverse it can get? Joe Gorder : We're still running like we've said in the past. We're running about a third corn oil, a third use cooking oil and then a third beef tallow type -- beef tallow or choice white grease. So same mix as we've been running historically. Prashant Rao : All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Manav Gupta : Hey, Joe, you talked about IMO 2020 in your opening comments. Yesterday there was a very positive development on that front. Ben Hawkings, the Deputy of Commercial Regulation and Standards at the U.S. Gulf Coastguard said that the Coastguard is getting ready to enforce the new fuel specifications and expects the industry to comply. He went on to say there is no possibility of slow rolling and he hopes for a harmonized global approach to enforcement. The way I see it, it's a big change from the stand some government officials were taking last October and they were talking about the phased implementation and possible delays. Some I'm trying to understand, do you believe the government is now more on board and the implementation program and so probability of success for rollout is materially higher than it was in October? Joe Gorder : That's a very good question. I'll let Jason talk about some of the specifics. Jason Fraser : That's right. Yes. We do agree with everything you said. We continue to expect IMO 2020 to be implemented and enforced. You don't schedule as most recently indicated by those comments by the Coastguard official you mentioned. It seems like things have quieted down with that administration and these EIA forecasts that come out over the last several months which didn't show a dramatic jump in prices. That's kind of calm the waters. Manav Gupta : Thank you guys. Thank you for taking my question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez with Simmons Energy. Your line is now open. Blake Fernandez : Thanks guys. Good morning. I had two questions for you. One, just probably for Gary on the supply side, but obviously there is a lot of discussion now with the Iranian waivers and potential for OPEC to ramp back up. I just didn't know if you had any comments on supply dynamics and how you see that may impact your inputs and maybe some of the heavy dynamics underway. Gary Simmons : Yes. So far we don't have any indication of additional OPEC barrels making their way to the market. We don't have any coming into our system as of yet and we'll wait to kind of hear that. I think they're meeting in early May to determine whether they're going to ramp up production. Blake Fernandez : Okay. Second question is on Diamond Green. I believe there was a bill submitted to the house on a potential two-year extension for the BTC and I didn't know if you had any updates or thoughts they are on lay of the land there? Jason Fraser : Okay. This is Jason. Of course, we support the extension of the blenders tax credit. We did see that bill introduced in the House is also one that's been introduced in the Senate by Grassley and Wyden. And of course, this is one of Senator or Chairman Grassley's main initiatives or one of his programs, he will most aggressively push for. So we are hopeful that something will happen this year, of course with the change over leadership in the House, the Democrats have to sort through the Democrat leadership sort through their priorities for what they want to move this year. But we're hopeful something happens. And it is an issue that has bipartisan support which is very helpful with a split legislature like we have. Blake Fernandez : All right. Thank you, Jason. Appreciate it guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Benny Wong : Thanks. Good morning guys. I just want to touch upon, I will follow up the question from Prashant about the widening Maya. I think we've seen widening sour differentials across the regions. Just wanted to get your perspective, what's driving this. Is it just really the weaker fuel oil prices or are you seeing other factors like corporate turnarounds or are you seeing simple refineries switching to a crude slate today ahead of IMO 2020. Gary Simmons : Well, I think most of what we're seeing today is driven by several components in the formula we mentioned the high sulfur fuel getting weaker the Brent GI are widening also helps the Maya differential get weaker and then the final thing is Midland WTS is still part of the Maya formula. So as WTS gets weaker it helps as well. I think those are the key drivers and certainly high sulfur fuel oil should continue to get weaker and help the Maya spread wide now. Lane Riggs : Hi. This is Lane. I will further color to that point. So right now medium sour you are asking about that as well. It's still a little bit out of the market with respect to its value relative to sweet and heavy. Those are the two most economic crudes. So there's still sort of an arbitrage that exists out there in the marketplace between medium and there is about 3% discount and you should see somewhat -- get some parity in all that, it all gets balanced again in the Atlantic basin. Benny Wong : Great. Thanks. And my follow up questions just a little bit extension on Blake's question. Just wanted to get a temperature check on DC. It seems like from where I'm sitting, the EPA is a little bit more moderated with headlines of them signaling took and can issue less small refinery waivers and potentially walking back the proposal to freeze their CAFE standards. Just wondering how your discussions with them has changed and if they're kind of shifting their focus order approach a little differently going forward? Thanks. Jason Fraser : This is Jason, again. And we hadn't seen them really ship their approach. They're definitely under pressure probably under constant pressure from the ethanol side. On the smaller farther waivers they have been for years, but they seemed to understand that the responsibility to grant smaller final exemptions is part of the statute, it's been reaffirmed by Congress and the court several times, have been several appellate cases on the issue. And so, we're encouraged by administrator Wheeler's comments at his confirmation hearing that he plan to follow the law. He understood how those programs are supposed to work and we hope the agency continues to act as they have in the past which is to grant the waivers where they seem to be appropriate. Benny Wong : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I guess we could go back a little bit. Gary you mentioned earlier that you were running max diesel obviously diesel cracks for a little below what they have been. I mean not weak by any standard, but it was just one of you can dive in a little bit what you're seeing in terms of diesel or distillate demand both here in the U.S. and then in terms of export demand? Gary Simmons : Sure. Yes. I think we had a little milder winter in the North Atlantic basin than what we typically had which hurt demand a little bit. That was certainly offset by lower production with the lower refinery utilization. I think moving forward certainly you're entering a time of the year where we typically see a little softer distillate demand as you don't have the heating oil demand. I think where this year is different with the market structure and the strong carry in the market, I think the [indiscernible] market will remain supported because as it weakens the barrels will be bid into storage. And so I think you'll see diesel continue to be supportive in the short-term and then you'll get the demand kick later in the year as we approach the IMO 2020 date. Roger Read : When speaking on the IMO front, when do you think we really start to see it in the forward curve? You mentioned earlier I think everybody would agree with you, I saw over oil discounts puts pressure on the lights or the sweet sour down, but like when do you think that shows up in the forward curve because one of the questions we've been getting from investors is, remind this from my IMO, when do I believe that IMO ammo is actually real in a sense I need to see it occur before I want to invest wholeheartedly on that front. Joe Gorder : So what we understand is really the last loads of high sulfur fuel oil that head to the Far East for shipping probably occurred in late September. So you start to see an impact on the high sulfur fuel market sometime in that late September, early October region. And then on the distillate side, I think it's probably in November, December type timeframe before you start to see an impact on the diesel side. Roger Read : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess that's my two questions and I won't take up the slot formerly used by an analyst who's on a break right now. Joe Gorder : Thanks Roger. Roger Read : See you guys. Thanks. Joe Gorder : See you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Low with Redburn. Your line is now open. Peter Low : Hi. Thanks for taking my two questions. The first was just on the balance sheet. Giving is getting towards the top-end of your guided range. I just want to know how comfortable you are with it at current levels and how you expect to prioritize de-gearing versus buybacks over the coming quarters. The second was on the projects due to completion this year particularly the Houston alkylation unit. Can you give us any color on the extent to which you expect those to impact capture rates and earnings? Thanks. Joe Gorder : Okay. So, Donna you want to -- yes, you want to. Donna Titzman : So, yes, we're very comfortable we are on the balance sheet in the context of leverage we design that target 20% to 30% to give us plenty of flexibility for growing our business and taking advantage of acquisitions as they come along. So, we're very comfortable we're at. We're at 27%, we're paying some debt off today. So that's going to bring the debt back down to 26%. And Joe, what is the other... Joe Gorder : Yes. The other he was dovetailing it in, Peter, you tell me if this is wrong, it sound like you are dovetailing it into the share repurchases. And we've been pretty clear all along that we weren't going to leverage the balance sheet to do share repurchases. I think that's why you saw the repurchases slightly less in the first quarter, we used the adjusted free cash flow metric as our target and that's how we're going to live with. We're running the business for the long-term and we feel that all of the components that we've identified, all of the goals we've set for ourselves are relevant and we don't want to deviate from that. So as cash flow picks up, I think you should expect that flywheel of share repurchase to increase also. But I wouldn't tie the two directly together the debt to cap and the share repurchase quantity. I hope that answers the second question. Peter Low : Yes. Joe Gorder : So, on the final question on the Houston alkylation on schedule to start up here in the second quarter specifically at the end of May, maybe give it for a June 1 startup. So what does that mean in terms of our results that means you're going to have about a third of the benefit in the second quarter and then you'll have the full benefit in the third and fourth quarter and it will absolutely go directly to capture rate. So some of our project like coppers don't go directly to improving our capture rate, we get additional volume, but this will because you're taking NGLs and getting all the way to sort of a premium gasoline component value so that should show up in our capture rates in the Gulf Coast. Peter Low : That's great. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Sam Margolin : Hey, good morning everybody. I had a supply question too. The last quarter's call there was some probing about the Venezuela sanctions and how that might affect you, but it looks like there's a lot of offset supply coming on from Brazil. Brazil production from 2018 was deferred it looks like it's coming on now. Is that a suitable substitute for you, are you looking at that at all, or does the spec not really work? I'm just wondering like what are the developments in your sort of Atlantic basin Latin America crude supply story since the last quarter's call and the Venezuela sanctions? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, I would tell you since the Venezuelan sanctions about a third of the barrels we are getting from Venezuela then replaced by running incremental domestic lights, we about a third of it is incremental heavy Canadian, and then, a third of it is just opportunistic cargos and some of that production that you're talking about in Brazil fits into that opportunistic cargo. We've definitely seen more volumes of Brazilian crude coming into the Gulf and also our West Coast. Sam Margolin : Okay. Thanks so much. And then, this is a -- it's been a recurring theme now for a while that you MidCon segments really starting to break out and capture versus historical rates are -- is up a lot. It obviously has a lot to do with Diamond Pipeline. Other operators outside of the Diamond partnership. Talk about Diamond a lot, it's an interesting strategic piece for other infrastructure that wants to loop into it, or connect it to some other ideas. Are you guys still in sort of a strategic dynamic review process with Diamond or are you very satisfied with the role it's playing in Valero today and you don't necessarily want to include it in other operators plans for trying to get crude to the eastern Gulf. Joe Gorder : There's two pieces to that question, right. There's the -- I mean the conversation around strategic use of the pipeline. But I mean, our initial emphasis for the pipeline was to assure crude supply in a particular crude supply into the Memphis refinery. You guys want to talk about that at all. Gary Simmons : Yes. That's gone extremely well. And we saw a stronger contribution of Diamond Pipeline in the first quarter '19 than we did in the first quarter of '18 and some of that's the water Brent TIR. The other change in our system was the Sunrise Pipeline which came online in the fourth quarter of '18. That not only improved our ability to get Midland Cushing, Midland barrels to Ardmore and McGee, but we are now able to get Midland barrels to Memphis and we certainly saw an uplift from that in the first quarter. Now, I'll let Rich handle the second part. Rich Lashway : Sure. So it was in January there was -- open season was on the cap line was announced. And part of that reversal open season was to tie the Diamond into that cap line. So plane has got an open season out there that will conclude next week. I think its Monday, the 29, and so they'll see whether or not there's enough interest to expand the cap -- expand the Diamond Pipeline, which would then tie into a cap line reversal. So that would be the strategic part of expanding the pipeline to get Cushing barrels to the Gulf Coast. Joe Gorder : So Sam, I mean from our perspective, the key is as Gary stated is just to be sure that we retain our ability to ship the volumes that we need into the Memphis refinery and then as an investor in the pipeline, I think we'll look at the options associated with a possible expansion. Sam Margolin : Thanks guys. That is exactly my question. Okay. Thanks everybody. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Brad Heffern : Hey, morning everyone. Maybe for Gary. I was just wondering if you can give thoughts on West Coast product supply. Obviously, there's been a lot of outages, we've seen some larger import activity on the gasoline side and obviously, if the West Coast gets behind it can struggle to catch up during driving season. So any thoughts on how that plays out through the year? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think like we've always talked, the West Coast is a little long refining capacity but when you have maintenance activities at times at the market and we've seen maintenance activities on the West Coast and inventories are low heading into gasoline season which I think you know bodes well to a fairly strong gasoline season on the West Brad Heffern : And then, looking at the Gulf Coast crude runs this quarter, you guys ran the most sweet, you've ever run. He ran the least medium. I'm just curious, if that's sort of the most barbell that the system can get. Or is there still room for more light and less medium if the spreads are telling you that? Lane Riggs : This is Lane. We were clearly in that mode, I thought I have alluded that earlier max. W have some turnaround activity or control refineries and turnaround. So, when you see us come out into the second or third quarter, our refineries come out of all this, you could see us have additional capacity where we're have that strategy. So we have some more room to do that. Brad Heffern : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Hey thanks a lot. Appreciate that the opportunity. So a couple of questions. I guess the first is, you had a number of organic projects that have come online over the course of last year and so just trying to think about what the earnings power would have been in the first quarter independent of some of those growth projects so we can isolate the growth on a commodity agnostic basis. Can you just talk about if the earnings power is structurally improved relative to a year ago and some of those projects have come online? Joe Gorder : You guys want to talk about the impact of the project? I think [indiscernible] different than the last few quarters maybe we will summarize. Well, obviously, okay, I think the refinery, we only have the Wilmington and Cajon. Gary Simmons : Yes. So the Sunrise definitely had a material impact on the first quarter results for us as you were able to capture that Midland to Cushing differential on the pipeline was space we have on Sunrise. Lane Riggs : Neil, there's been a host of things though right. I mean we've got the Diamond Green Diesel expansion that we're seeing the benefits of also. And you've seen it multiple times but in the deck, we've got the fact that we believe that the projects that were completed produced another $340 million of incremental EBITDA. So, we -- if you compare year-over-year and how we performed in kind of a similar margin environment, I think you would find that the projects have contributed significantly to the earnings capability of the company. Joe Gorder : Over pipeline projects and then the Diamond Green Diesel expansion. Lane Riggs : Right. Neil Mehta : Yes. That's helpful. And then, the follow-up question is, just on the cash balances, you guys have had around $2.8 billion. Is it fair -- is it a long-term target still to move towards $2 billion that's still the right level. I know you were running substantially higher than that before. But how do we think about that optimal cash balance number? Donna Titzman : Yes. If you look at the $2.8 billion, so we know we issued some debt towards the end of March $1 billion that was slated to refinance the maturity that is in early 2020. Today, we pay -- we redeem that those notes today. So you kind of pro forma the cash, it was really closer to $1.9 billion at the end of March. Joe Gorder : And Neil, we think that's still a reasonable target. And, we'll test around it both directions and just see if it holds up longer term. And then, the other thing to keep in mind is that we bought back the deal during the quarter and that was $950 million of cash. So there'll be times, when I think you'll see the cash balance increase, if we're looking at something like that. But otherwise the $2 billion is still probably a good point of reference for you guys to use in your modeling. Neil Mehta : Perfect. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Phil Gresh : Hey, good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi, Phil. Phil Gresh : The first question with Diamond Green Diesel is here as a new segment. You gave us some color on throughput and then cost -- your JV partner, I think has given a view on EBITDA guidance of $1.25 to $1.40 per gallon, I believe. Your first quarter obviously was a bit below that maybe seasonality, you could talk to that. But is that a right way for us to be thinking about this business, is that something you'd agree with. Just a little color to help us think about this business longer term. Martin Parrish : And this is Martin. I think that's a good way to think about the business you're right on the first quarter we were at $0.85 per gallon EBITDA that was negatively impacted by a hedge loss of $0.37 a gallon. So if you adjusted EBITDA would have been 122, I think a better way to look at it as the last six months because we had a big hedge positive in the fourth quarter. So if you look at the last six months the weighted average EBITDA was $1.24 a gallon. So right on top of the $1.25 and these hedge gain loss is not significant over the life of Diamond Green. It's just been these big moves in the ULS flat price in the last six months. Phil Gresh : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. The second question I guess would be a bit of a follow up to Roger's question where he was asking about how the strip is representing expectations for the diesel crack looking out to early 2020. I guess is it your view that that many times we talk about the strip is never right, but is it your view that this is not an accurate representation of what might happen to the diesel price or there are some prior comments about how maybe there's going to be more BGO feedstocks that will enter the diesel pool. Just curious how you think this actually plays out over the next six to 12 months. Thanks. Martin Parrish : Yes. So, I would say that I think the diesel forward curve is not a very good representation of what we would expect the foreign markets would look like, you are seeing more contango start to edge its way into the market. I think that will continue as you get closer to the date, but I think we'll have a stronger diesel environment than what's currently reflected in the curve. Phil Gresh : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Your line is now open. Jason Gabelman : Hey, thanks for taking the call. I wanted to ask I know there was a question about the West Coast, but I wanted to follow up on it. I believe your Venetia plant has been down for a little bit. I was wondering what the impact was on the quarter and if you have line of sight when that asset is going to come back online. Lane Riggs : Well, this is Lane. So yes, we have about eight days of downtime in our Venetia refinery we had a crude leak in the furnace and so we had to bring the entire refinery down to repair. And so consequently we moved a turnaround that we had budgeted in the first quarter '20 into the timeframe. So we're essentially executing a turnaround so we should start the refinery up sort of mid May-ish or somewhere in the later maybe it will be somewhere in the May timeframe term start the refinery up. The other thing that we had happen in the quarter that didn't get a lot of press was we had our McKee refinery had an air blower -- main air blower Allergan. So -- and that was a big event as well in terms of our impact in the quarter an unusual event and thought it was $90 million. So if you're trying to sort of frame what the earnings potential for the first quarter could have been the bigger event in the first quarter actually was our McKee, again, it was about $90 million for the growth margin impact. Jason Gabelman : Got it. Thanks. And if I could ask a question on I believe you moved the Memphis turnaround from April of this year into 2020 and I thought that was an interesting data point just because it seems like your peers are doing the opposite trying to conduct their maintenance in the first half of this year. So, I'm wondering if you saw something in the market that made you alter maintenance plans there. And then, just what you're seeing more generally in the industry on maintenance activities in the first half of this year and maybe into the second half as well. Thanks. Lane Riggs : Yes. So unfortunately I guess some bad information, our methods refinery goes into an SEC turnaround in about a week or so. But, we don't normally try to position take you know we'll maybe nudge turnarounds around certain things, but we aren't taking. We didn't make a huge effort to try to move our turnarounds and to accommodate IMO 2020 is because we have a lot of assets. So, but anyway that's kind of where we are on that in terms of the industry we don't really comment on other players and industry or what we think maintenance activity might be. Jason Gabelman : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes right up Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question here. So compared to a year ago, you ran substantially higher light sweet crude volumes or at least the share of your total crude slate and at the same time your default yield ticked up a little bit. And so I was wondering, can we draw a direct connection there that a higher distill yield with these lights or was that just noise your year-over-year. Lane Riggs : Actually what we see is, we maximize light sweet. We tend to make the same amount of gasoline and less a little bit less distill. So a yield shift is probably more tied to hydro cracker utilizations and what units we actually had down for maintenance rather than a change in the crude slate. Matthew Blair : Got it. Okay. And then just an accounting clarification, so there's this $2.5 billion of CapEx in the next two years. Does that include the 550 of spending for the Diamond Green Diesel expansion? Joe Gorder : Yes, it will. Yes, it's not all in the year. Okay. And this is spread out over 2021. Matthew Blair : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open. Craig Shere : Good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi, Craig. Craig Shere : What are the great comments about catalysts for improving cracks into the second half in 2020. I guess my question is more systemic in terms of the new mid cycle levels we might see aided by IMO 2020, or are you getting more confident that we could see some sustained benefit lasting three to five years here. Joe Gorder : So really, I think that question goes to what's the sustainability of the tailwinds for IMO 2020. Gary Simmons : Yes. I think it's hard for us to predict, how quickly shifts put in scrubbers. It looks like that's not going to be fast and that the impact of aim of 2020 will be longer lasting than what we initially assumed. But I don't know that we have a lot of great data on that. Craig Shere : Are ships even able to put in scrubbers the way we were thinking a year ago, it sounded like simpler the waste water disposal becomes an issue now? Gary Simmons : It certainly that the most economic scrubbers are the open lube scrubbers which put the sulfur back into the ocean. And so, as questions have come up whether there are going to be allowed to do that, it certainly presents another degree of difficulty when people are trying to make those capital investments. Craig Shere : And last quick question. I noticed that the corporate expenses down sequentially and year-over-year, anything to read into efficiencies or cost controls? Joe Gorder : We are always focused on efficiencies and cost controls. I just don't know if they would have been material enough that -- Jason Fraser : In the first quarter of '18, we actually had an environmental reserve adjustment, it is one of the special items that's reflected in the press release. Joe Gorder : Okay. Craig Shere : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Bhullar for closing remarks. Homer Bhullar : Great. Thanks Liz. We appreciate everyone joining in and feel free to contact the IR team, if you have any additional questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. And you may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this call will be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Homer Bhullar, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you've not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joseph Gorder : Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that we had good operating performance in the second quarter despite having major turnarounds at our Houston, Memphis and Benicia refineries. We ran reliably during the quarter with very limited unplanned downtime. Gasoline cracks improved significantly in the second quarter relative to the first quarter in all regions boosting refining margins. However, the supplies of medium and heavy sour crude oils remained limited due to continued Venezuelan and Iranian sanctions and OPEC production curtailments resulting in narrower crude discounts for those grades relative to Brent crude oil. As a result, we optimized our system with additional domestic light sweet, Canadian heavy and Latin American crude oils. In fact, we set another record for Canadian heavy crude oil runs this quarter with over 190,000 barrels per day. Turning to our renewable segments, the ethanol business generated positive operating income, despite a weak margin environment. And our growing renewable diesel business continues to generate strong results due to the high demand for renewable diesel. We continue to deliver on our commitment to grow Valero's earnings capability through organic growth investments. We successfully completed the Houston alkylation unit project in the second quarter as scheduled and on budget. This project is now allowing us to upgrade low-cost and abundant natural gas liquids and refinery olefins to produce a premium alkylate product. And we continue to make progress on the Central Texas pipelines and terminals project, which remains on track to be fully operational in the third quarter of this year. Looking at organic growth beyond this year, we have a steady pipeline of projects to enhance the margin profitability of our portfolio. The Pasadena terminal, St. Charles alkylation unit and Pembroke cogeneration unit are expected to be completed in 2020. And the Diamond Green Diesel expansion and Port Arthur Coker are expected to be completed in late 2021 and 2022, respectively. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged with an annual CapEx for both 2019 and 2020 at approximately $2.5 billion with growth capital targeting projects with high returns that are focused on operating cost control, market expansion and margin improvement. With respect to cash returns to stockholders, we continue to target an annual payout ratio of 40% to 50%. In the second quarter, we paid out $588 million to stockholders bringing the year-to-date total payout ratio to 50% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. Looking ahead, we're optimistic for the balance of the year with fundamentals supporting continued, healthy product demand. Vehicle miles traveled continues to increase year-over-year, and we expect positive market impacts from the IMO 2020 implementation as bunker fuel terminals transition to lower-sulfur fuel oil. With our high complexity refineries, we believe that we're well-positioned to take advantage of the expected wider differentials for heavy crude oils and higher product cracks. Lastly, we remain committed to disciplined growth and to delivering long-term value to our stockholders through exceptional and environmentally responsible operations. So, with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the second quarter of 2019, net income attributable to Valero's stockholders was $612 million or $1.47 per share compared to $845 million or $1.96 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Second quarter 2019 adjusted net income attributable to Valero's stockholders was $629 million or $1.51 per share compared to $928 million or $2.15 per share for the second quarter of 2018. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany this release. Operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of 2019 was $1 billion compared to $1.4 billion for the second quarter of 2018. The decrease from the second quarter of 2018 was mainly attributed to significantly narrower medium and heavy sour crude oil differentials relative to Brent crude oil. Refining throughput volumes averaged 3 million barrels per day, which was 70,000 barrels per day higher than the second quarter of 2018. Throughput capacity utilization was 94% in the second quarter of 2019. Refining cash operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $3.80 per barrel, in line with the second quarter of 2018. The ethanol segment generated $7 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $43 million in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease from the second quarter of 2018 was primarily due to higher corn prices. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.5 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 531,000 gallons per day versus the second quarter of 2018, primarily due to added production from the three ethanol plants acquired in November 2018. The renewable diesel segment generated $77 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $30 million in the second quarter of 2018. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 769,000 gallons per day in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 387,000 gallons per day versus the second quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income and sales volumes were primarily due to the expansion of the Diamond Green Diesel plant in the third quarter of 2018. For the second quarter of 2019, general and administrative expenses were $199 million and net interest expense was $112 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $566 million and income tax expense was $160 million in the second quarter of 2019. The effective tax rate was 20%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $9.5 billion, and cash and cash equivalents were $2 billion. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 26%. At the end of June, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. With regard to investing activities, we made $740 million of capital investments in the second quarter of 2019, of which approximately $510 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion in the second quarter. Excluding the impact from the change in working capital during the quarter, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion. Moving to financing activities. We returned $588 million to our stockholders in the second quarter. $376 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 2.6 million shares of Valero common stock. This brings our year-to-date return to stockholders to $1 billion and the total payout ratio to 50% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. As of June 30, we had approximately $2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to expect annual capital investments for both 2019 and 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion with approximately 60% allocating to sustaining the business and approximately 40% to growth. The $2.5 billion includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.71 million to 1.76 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 255,000 to 275,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 460,000 to 480,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be approximately $4.05 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4.3 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2019. Operating expenses in 2019 should be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.16 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For 2019, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $840 million. The annual effective tax rate is still estimated at 23%. For the third quarter, net interest expense should be $114 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $560 million. Lastly, we still expect the RINs expense for the year to be between $300 million and $400 million. That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Manav Gupta from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Manav Gupta : Congrats on the good quarter. We understand that Brent Maya is a little tight right now. But when we look at the forward curves of Brent and 3% credit spread on Bloomberg, we assumed about a $8.50 or $9 widening in the next six months. Now since HSFO makes up 40% of the Maya pricing formula, mathematically, it translates to about $3 to $4 widening of Brent Maya. So, could the Brent Maya easily be $10, just following the pricing formula as it exists today or do you think Pemex, et cetera, try and step in and try and change the formula and get rid of high sulfur fuel oil pricing from the formula? Joseph Gorder : Manav, that's a really good question. Why don't we let Gary give you some insight into that? Gary Simmons : Yes. Manav, so I guess I'll answer the question on the formula first. Our discussions with PMI would indicate that they will change the formula in the coming weeks. So, we do expect a change in the formula. However, we do hold to your view on where heavy sour discounts are going. If you look at where Maya is today and the backwardation in the high sulfur fuel oil market, it would tell you around a $3 discount from where heavy sour discounts are today. And then if you look at the Western Canadian Select quote in the Gulf, even today, Western Canadian Select is discounted 15% to Brent, which is a good discount, even if you compare it to domestic light sweet alternatives such as MEH. Western Canadian Select is trading at 11% discount to MEH. The forward market on the Canadian side, at least there's trade being done in the fourth quarter already, and you're seeing Western Canadian Select discount at around $2.50 in the fourth quarter already. So that's pretty close to the $3 number that you were looking at. Manav Gupta : A quick follow-up sticking to the Western Canadian Select. A Canadian major about 25 minutes ago on their call said that if deal with the government is struck, they could see rail ramping by 250,000 to 300,000 barrels by year-end. So that's a massive volume of crude landing in the Gulf Coast. I'm just trying to understand if this WCS does land on the Gulf Coast by year-end or, let's say, early 2020, can you seamlessly switch between WCS, Maya or any heavy grades that you were running? Gary Simmons : Yes, pretty much. And we've had discussions and would concur with that view that the rail volume will be ramping up and had a lot of discussions with producers. And we take that into our Port Arthur refinery, and it pretty much is a direct replacement for Maya. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Douglas Leggate : Joe, last time you and I sat down, we talked about your underappreciated, let's say, flexibility on light crude. My question is obviously the alky units helping a little bit on NGLs. But as we look into the second half of this year and then into 2020, the ramp up, the expected ramp up from the Permian, it was coming with a lot of question marks over what the gravity of that crude is going to look like and the potential for an renewed period of, let's say, dislocations in pricing. I'm just curious if you could talk through what Valero's opportunity would be in that situation. Could you take advantage of that? Or obviously, your complex system is -- folks normally think about you as advantaged by things like WCS. I'm curious as to whether you could exploit that opportunity as well. I've got a follow-up, please. Gary Simmons : Doug, this is Gary again. So, we certainly are maximizing light sweet into the system. In the second quarter, we used about 89% of our available capacity, and really, what was left on the table was primarily due to turnaround activity. As we move forward, we expect to utilize all of that. As the gravity gets lighter, we are seeing this WTL \"coming out,\" which is a lighter grade of WTI. We started running some of that in Three Rivers. I think in the second quarter, we ran 5,000 to 10,000 barrels a day of that, and we've also purchased some for future runs at Memphis. I think we're scheduled to run about 40,000 barrels a day of WTL in Memphis in September. So, we're certainly moving in that direction and watching the spreads, and the discount is there. We have a lot of flexibility being able to take it into our system. Douglas Leggate : Okay. Are you retooling, Gary? Or are you pretty much just flexing within the constraints of the system? Gary Simmons : It is pretty much within the constraints of the system. However, the new toppers we built at Corpus and Houston give us a lot more flexibility in this area. Douglas Leggate : Great stuff. My follow-up -- go ahead, Joe. Joseph Gorder : I think that's -- Doug, our position on that, when we're going to expand our saturation gas plant at Port Arthur as a part of the coker project. So, in 2022, we'll also have an increased capability to run light sweet. Douglas Leggate : Okay. I have no doubt that you guys will be taking advantage where you can. My follow-up is, Joe, is really more of a macro question. This time last year, the optimism was perhaps a little egregious on IMO impacts. Have you seen anything yet in terms of turning tanks or indicated demand? There seems to be a lot of news coming out of pretty much a lot of international refiners on the compliant fuels that they are now able to supply. Has your expectation for the impact of IMO on distillate margins eased any? Or are you still pretty constructive on the disruptive impact as we go into next year? And I'll leave it there. Joseph Gorder : Thanks, Doug. And I mean, I guess our view all along has been that we would probably start to see something third -- late third to fourth quarter of this year. It's been interesting, Doug, that the forward markets really haven't reflected the distillate impact. I think we're starting to see it in other places, but do you guys want to share your views? Gary Simmons : No, I think you are seeing people start to turn tanks, and that's one of the reasons you see high sulfur fuel oil strength, is it's just a not a very liquid market today and ships are having trouble actually buying high sulfur fuel oil, which is bidding that market up today, so you see the steep backwardation as we approach that January time line. And I agree with Joe, all the estimates I still see show a fairly significant step change in diesel demand when the IMO bunker spec changes, and it's not reflected in the forward curve today. Operator : Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Prashant Rao : I wanted to touch back on the Western Canadian Select availability. 190,000 barrels per day in this quarter is still running strong there. And as we expect that discount to widen with rail hitting the Gulf, I wanted to get a sense of your ability to lean into that a bit more. How much could you ramp beyond the 190,000? And as you're looking at incremental rail contract, what sort of -- give us some idea what sort of duration maybe you're thinking? Or do you have the contracting -- contract in hand you need and we're just going to see that sort of flex up in the numbers as we go forward as you take advantage of those discounts? Gary Simmons : Yes. We have a lot of flexibility to run the heavy Canadian. We're primarily advantaged to run it at our Texas City and Port Arthur refinery just because we have the best logistics to be able to get into those two assets. Between those two refineries, probably a capacity about 300,000 barrels a day today to process it. We can run about 50,000 a day at St. Charles, and we could run some at Corpus Christi as well, but again, the logistics of getting that in are more challenged. On the rail side, we continue to work with producers, and we're doing deals on a delivered basis, whereas in the past we were buying barrels in Western Canada and shipping them ourselves, and that volume will continue to ramp up as we get those deals done. Prashant Rao : Okay. It's very helpful. And then just switching back on sort of a bigger picture question. With the Houston alky project getting completed, I wanted to take a step back and get your views on where you guys are finding the whole system in the country stands in terms of Tier 3 compliance. I think we're getting the Seymour teams. There has been so much that we're looking at and refining in terms of the macro. So, a few questions that may be concerns about how tight octane is going to get by the time we get to 1Q '20. Just your updated views at what you -- how you think the system stands today in terms of the progress we're making. And then, I guess, relatively speaking, where your position is relative to that? It feels like you'd be advantaged in that kind of a tight octane market. But any color you can provide there would be helpful. Lane Riggs : Yes. This is Lane. So, we've always had a strategic outlook that octane was going to get more valuable as Tier 3 matured and finally came to us ahead here at the end of the year and combined that with sort of cheap NGLs. That was the reason we did these projects and they're coming online at exactly the right time. You were definitely seeing -- we believe we're seeing octane get more and more expensive. In terms of where the industry is on a Tier 3 compliance, we're trying to -- we're looking at that ourselves. But if you look at us as a proxy for that, we still have three units that have to come online by the end of the year. So, there's still some more octane disruption in the industry ahead of us. Joseph Gorder : I mean, people's implementation though has been, I would say, somewhat muted or delayed as... Lane Riggs : Been using credits. Joseph Gorder : Yes, they were using credits. And to the extent you could use credits, you defer the capital, but now we're getting to the point where the rubber meets the road, and it's going to be a lot of makeup activity or we are going to see this spread continue to expand. Operator : Our next question comes from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Benny Wong : Just wanted to ask about the capture rate in the second quarter. It's particularly weak in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Understand the light/heavy differentials probably contribute to that. But just wanted to get a sense if there's any other factors weighing on that. If there is any risk of those factors persisting. And conversely, in North Atlantic, the capture is really strong. It has been strong for a couple quarters. Just wanted to get a sense is it Europe or U.S. driving that, and should we expect a higher capture level going forward? Lane Riggs : Benny, this is Lane. And for Prashant, I'm sorry, a while ago, I called you Benny. So -- and the Gulf Coast is a good proxy for what -- in terms of capture rate, we're down about 20% year-over-year. About 10% to maybe 12% of that is crude differentials, some of it's ours, some of it's just quality. But the remaining 7% to 8% is non-gasoline products. Everybody sort of talks about naphtha and how cheap it is, but the other products that are also discounted year-over-year are propylene and propane. So, you can sort of come to your own conclusion about what direction propylene is going to, and obviously propane, NGLs are just getting cheaper and cheaper or follow the oil shale. We're still optimistic that -- and the rest of it's -- we're optimistic that, as Gary alluded to, that IMO 2020 will help improve the medium and heavy sour discounts in terms of where naphtha is going and propylene is going. I mean, they are probably structurally pretty weak for at least some period of time here. And then on the Line 9 or Atlantic, really what you're seeing on the North Atlantic capture rate is our continued advantaged position on our Line 9 crudes. Benny Wong : Got it. Appreciate the color there. My follow-up is really, one of your peers has been talking about, just preparing ahead of IMO 2020 was really looking to take advantage of slack coking capacity within their system and maybe redirecting excess fuel oils from one part of the portfolio into other areas where there might be excess capacity. Is this something that you guys looked at within your portfolio? Or is there an opportunity for that? Seems like more of a logistical optimization exercise, just curious is that something that you guys looked at? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, I guess, what you're saying is where we have fuel oil length potentially taking it to open coking capacity. Is that the question? Benny Wong : Yes. Essentially, the question is do you guys have some areas where you have slack coking capacity and if there are areas where you have fuel oil length, exactly what you're saying. Gary Simmons : Yes. So, we don't make much oil in our system, and we pretty much keep our coking capacity full. We are providing some flexibility with the Port Arthur coking project to take some fuel oil we produce at Meraux and potentially run it in the Port Arthur Coker when it's expanded. Lane Riggs : To Gary's point, what you'll actually see -- so we plan to be full at both coker and like he said, we don't make much fuel oils in the system. But what it does do is it competes, just like some of the long resid today that competes for crude capacity, and that we do believe you're going to see more and more of that, as some of these blending components that run 3.5% to 8% fuel oil will ultimately have to probably get ran through crude units and compete with other medium and heavy sour crude. That's obviously why we feel pretty good about the cost of feedstock from here going into next year as a result of IMO 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Lane, can I ask you a follow-up about the capture rate impact and naphtha, because you sort of touched on something that's swirling around the market. Was there anything -- were you producing sort of excess naphtha or LPGs for any reason besides just an increase in light crude throughput in the Gulf Coast? Was there something coming out of the 1Q turnaround or something having to do with the 2Q turnaround at Houston that exacerbated the capture rate impact of the commodity dispersion that you quoted with naphtha and LPGs? Lane Riggs : Not really. I mean, we did have the turnarounds and so have to go back. And if anything, we would have run more crude and had more naphtha. And our reformers were full. Right now, one of the most economic units in addition to alky is our reformer. And so, we would have had our reformer signaled full. So, I'd have to go look and see what the balance was on naphtha, but we weren't -- directionally, it's just we make the -- we have a position on naphtha, and it goes if we get longer, is we run more and more light sweet crude. Gary Simmons : I think exactly. It's really more of a function of the crude diet and then the other factors. A lot of the U.S. Gulf Coast naphtha was going to Venezuela and diluent. And so certainly, as that has shut off, it's caused naphtha to get weaker. Sam Margolin : Okay. And then this is sort of an IMO question. There's some reports that bring up here and there about heavy sweet crude pricing. It's pretty scarce, and this isn't the case everywhere heavy sweet is available, but it's printing at some pretty wide premiums to Brent in certain locations. Is this an IMO signal? Or is this like an idiosyncratic weird crude that just trades off-spec and doesn't mean anything? Lane Riggs : Gary and I will tag-team this. I think a lot of those crudes are either from Angola or Brazil. And they have -- it's going to be interesting to see how they fit in the IMO 2020 universe. I mean, there's some belief that you can burn directly. I mean, I'm not sure that's the highest value for them necessarily, but -- and there is some substitution effect as you're seeing some of these heavy sour crudes come off, they -- these are substitute crudes for coking refineries. And so, they've certainly gotten the word that's not necessarily the best grade. But if you look at the things they have is they don't have a lot of naphtha in them. So, I mean, it's the world just sort of resorting out that quality. Gary Simmons : Yes. I think that's a lot of what you see today, is as people have pushed a lot more the light sweet, they're getting loaded up on the top end of their distillation column and some of these medium sweets allow them to push rate as long as the crack spreads are strong. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : First question is around renewable diesel. And just trying to figure out how we should think about this business in the context of Valero. How big do you want it to be? And related to the segment, there's some big swings on profitability. One could be a Blender's Tax Credit. The other is how you see the low-carbon fuel standard playing out in California. So just some -- any high-level thoughts on the segment. How you see it playing out over time? And then how we should think about some of the swings that could drive some upside optionality on the profitability here? Martin Parrish : Neil, this is Martin. We expect low-carbon fuel mandates to grow across the globe. In Europe, you've got the Renewable Energy Directive now out to 2030. You got the low-carbon fuel standard in California out to 2030. There's talk, on again and off again about Canada adopting the standard. So, we're bullish on this and we're actively evaluating opportunities for expansion where they make sense. As far as the Blender's Tax Credit, obviously, if that comes in, that's a big upside for us. If it doesn't, we're still in good shape. We did a $1.26 EBITDA in this last -- second quarter with no Blender's Tax Credit. If you look in California, they are already blending at 10% renewable diesel. There is really no limit to where you can get with renewable diesel, meets the same specs as hydrocarbon diesel. So, we feel good about the prospects. We've got a great partner with Darling that's -- for the feedstock procurement and the front-end processing. So, we plan to keep growing the business. Joseph Gorder : Jason, anything on the Blender's Tax Credit? Jason Fraser : Yes. I'll be glad to talk about that. As you all probably know, the Blender's Tax Credit expired at the end of 2017, and both the Senate and the House tax-writing committees are looking at bills to extend it. They've got a bill that will extend two years in the Senate, and the House has a bill that will extend it for three years. And we believe it's going to get -- we're not sure exactly how it will get done or which bill it will get attached to, but we're confident it will get done by the end of the year. That's certainly our expectation, likely through the appropriations process that takes place this fall. Neil Mehta : That's great. It's an interesting business. The other one -- it's been a while since we've asked about RINs here. They have kind of picked their head back up in terms of the D6 RINs price. Not enough for us to get super concerned, but something at least to watch from the periphery. So just any thoughts in terms of how we should think about the RINs market from here, especially because there is uncertainty around the degree of waivers for small refinery exemptions here in 2019. Jason Fraser : Yes, sure. This is Jason. I'll give you our update on some of the recent developments on the RFS front. On June 15, the EPA published their final rule, which granted the 1-pound RVP waiver to E15 year round and also made some limited market reforms to the RIN market. We don't think either of those is really going to radically change the landscape. There are many reasons E15 hadn't taken off in the past, and those are still here, even with the RVP waiver, like concerns about using it in older cars, potential capital requirements at stations. And we also understand there will probably be a legal challenge to whether the EPA has authority to grant that waiver as well. So that's going to be an additional wait on the market as people wait and see if the waiver is going to -- or the additional waiver holds up, which will -- but there is definitely some question about whether the EPA has the authority to do that or whether it has to be done by Congress. And as for the RIN market reforms the EPA adopted, which are really just a public disclosure when a company goes over a certain RIN holding threshold, and then adding some data reporting requirements. We don't think they're going to make much of a difference. It's really inadequate to improve the functioning of the RIN market a lot. So, the bottom line is we don't think either of those is going to be a dramatic effect on the RIN market. Regarding small refiner waivers, which you mentioned, there's been a lot of discussion in the press about them lately. The biofuel lobby has been aggressively pushing to not have them granted this year. And this is despite multiple studies that show the SREs haven't led to any real biofuel demand destruction. But that SRE process is very well established as part of the RFS statute, and the EPA has gotten guidance from Congress as well as several court cases on how to administer them. So, we're confident the EPA is going to continue to follow the law and hopefully will be announcing their decisions on the 2018 applications soon. We think from their website they have about 38 applications pending for 2018. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Philip Gresh : A couple quick ones here. One is as we continue to see these increased flows out of the Permian to Texas Gulf Coast of light sweet crude, how are you envisioning things playing out in Corpus Christi, given the inflow versus outflow situation there and the timing of certain export terminals? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, Phil, our focus here is really to have been -- get connected to all the lines that make their way to Corpus, and we made a lot of progress there. So, we can receive pretty much all of the lines that are coming in. And then we've also doing some dock work at Corpus to where we can export more to Qu\u00e9bec and Pembroke and that work will be finished in the fourth quarter as well, which will give us more control on that supply chain on exports into our system. I really can't comment too much on it. I guess what you're kind of asking more about is, is there enough dock capacity to clear the oil? And I don't know that I have a lot of insight whether that's the case or not. Philip Gresh : Okay. Second question would just be around the grade of crude that's going to be coming down those pipelines, a lot more of the West Texas light that everyone has been talking about. Just kind of wondering how you think about running that grade of crude through your system versus more of a WTI grade. What capacity you might have to run West Texas light? And given Lane's comments just around the lightening of the crude slate and the impact that has on NGL and naphtha margins coming out, is that something that you consider as you think about what type of crude you want to run? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, Phil, it's just all a matter of price. We have plenty of capacity to be able to process the barrel. Historically, we've seen a lot of the light material that makes its way to the Gulf price such that we don't have an economic incentive to run it, and it goes to the export market. Some of the WTL that's been making its way to Corpus has been pricing at $1.25 type discount to MEH. And so, we've seen some incentive to buy it. And if that's the case, we certainly have a lot of capacity to run it, but it will depend on how its prices. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : I guess maybe -- come back, Lane, to your comments about the Gulf Coast and the light/heavy differentials impact that's had. But it was interesting to me in the quarter year-over-year, you actually had a better distillate yield relative to gasoline yield despite, I guess, running a somewhat lighter slate. So, I just wonder if you could kind of give us an idea of how that's happened because it seems a little contrary to the kind of the conventional wisdom, run more lights, get more gasoline? And then maybe how that tied in also to the issue with the excess naphtha? I'm just trying to kind of understand how it seems like you're running a better heavy slate in terms of product with a lighter yield, yet the lights caught you on the capture in the end. Lane Riggs : Yes. So, Roger, what I would say is we did have the FCC down in Houston -- the whole FCC Houston alky complex was down from -- a big chunk of the quarter, so consequently, our gasoline production was off. In terms of naphtha, we are -- again, with the signal's been max reformer the whole time. So, as you increment into the light sweet, it leads to us, and I believe the industry is in the same spot, as you run more and more light sweet, more of it has to be exported, and ultimately, it clears in the Far East. And so, it doesn't go in the gasoline. Now there will be, and I'm sure part of what's happening right now with this Tier 3 is saturating the gasoline and lowering octane and there's just an abundance of naphtha, everybody is trying to figure out a way to get naphtha back into the gasoline pool. But you need octane to do that. And right now, the industry is trying to get that -- figure out that balance as again, as Tier 3 is getting acclimated. Roger Read : Okay. Maybe as a quick follow-up on that. What or who or where is our best incremental source of octane outside of the U.S.? Gary Simmons : Well, that's a good question. We've seen some imports, but I can't tell you exactly where that's coming from. Historically, India excesses alkylate, and we see some trade flow of barrels from India coming over. The other thing you see today is that either toluene and xylene is using as a gasoline blend component, with where its prices, you have an incentive to blend naphtha with toluene to make gasoline. So that's another source of octane. Lane Riggs : To Gary's point, the issue you have around that, at some point on the reformulated gasoline fuels, you'll read a toxic limit. That's where alkylate is really important. It allows you -- as you get more alkylate in the pool, it allows you to incrementally raise the amount of aromatics in the gasoline as well. But yes. Roger Read : We could probably spend the whole call on these kind of intricacies. Lane Riggs : That was -- yes, exactly. Roger Read : As a follow-up question, ethanol, really weak. You did the acquisition -- I don't remember if it closed into the very beginning of the year or very end of last year, but it's been a tough period here in ethanol. We've seen some competitors shutting down some of their plants and refinancing their companies and everything. Obviously, your size, you're not worried about making it through the process. But I was just wondering light at the end of the tunnel, is that a 2020 thing? Is it -- we have to know how the '19 corn crop turned out? Is it the trade issues with China? Can maybe an order of what matters in magnitude of those events, if you could? Martin Parrish : Roger, this is Martin. Yes. If you look at the -- this is the latest corn crop really in the history of the record, which goes back 40 years. So, you've got the latest corn crop and right now, so the December CBOT price was $3.70 a bushel in early May, went to $4.70 a bushel by mid-June. Now it's back down to about $4.30. So, there's just a lot of uncertainty how big is the crop. And what really matters is the carryout at the end of this 2019 crop year. And nobody knows at this point. There's still weather that could impact it. So, it's going to be hard to have real big ethanol margins for this crop here in the U.S. Now obviously if China opens up, that helps a lot. That's a little different story, right. They have a 10% mandate, and that would make a big difference on the exports right away. Absent that, you're going to see -- you saw our forward guidance is lower than we ran. So, we're going to trim a little bit. A lot of people are going to have to trim more. We've got a great fleet. In the long term, when you're relying on a crop, these things happen, right? We've had five years now where yields have been above trend and then due for one below it. So, we'll get through this. Obviously, we're still bullish about ethanol. Long term, it's a great octane component. It's part of the fuel mix to stay, so we'll be there with it. Joseph Gorder : Two things I would add to what Martin said. First of all, the industry is just overproduced for what it is today. That's the fundamental problem here. So, what have we done? Well, we have ramped up exports as an industry, and that's where tariffs become a factor in these things. And it takes a while in the developed markets, but we have been, Valero has been very aggressive in exporting ethanol and we'll continue to be aggressive going forward. The other thing, and Jason spoke to this earlier, was the whole E15 issue. The ethanol industry broadly has this notion allowing E15, which as we said will be challenged, is going to solve some of this problem. Frankly, I think the solution to this problem is a higher octane fuel that helps with CAFE, and it could be a nationwide standard like 95 RON. It would require more ethanol to be blended into the fuel mix. It would take all the arguments out of what types of fuel we're going to produce in market broadly. And if we could just get everybody synced up. This is one of the things where amazingly, the autos are on board, the retail marketers are on board, refiners are okay with this. And in the ethanol industry, we've seen that this was a good solution to this problem that we're facing. Perhaps we could make some progress, but there is a genuine distrust, and we're going to have to get over that. But we will continue to bash away on this, because I agree with Martin. Ethanol is going to be part of the fuel mix for a very long time, and it will recover. Roger Read : Yes, probably part of the problem of building it on a mandate as opposed to a market incentive to pull more product in. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotia Howard Weil. Joseph Gorder : Is this Paul Cheng? Paul Cheng : Believe or not. Two quick questions. Maybe this is either for Lane or Gary. I know that you guys don't produce a lot of resid, but when you're looking at the bunker fuel market, going into the very low sulfur fuel oil, do you know or that -- I mean, how are you guys going to go around to get there? I mean, are you going to take the VGO or that you're trying to brand the high sulfur fuel oil into that? And what do you think the industry approach is going to be? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, Paul, we've been working very hard to develop low sulfur fuel oil blends. We work with several shipping companies. We currently have, I think, three shipping companies burning our low sulfur fuel oil blend. So, we've been working hard to be able to produce compliant fuel. Paul Cheng : Gary, can you share with us that -- I mean, what is the path or the approach that you guys take? Because it seems like it's very, very inefficient to trying to use the high sulfur fuel oil and blend it with the ultra-low sulfur diesel into that. Seems like that it more makes sense to using the VGO. But if that's the case, we will have a major problem of the much lower gasoline yield? Gary Simmons : Yes. That's exactly right, Paul. So, what we're looking at is some of these low sulfur heavy streams that we typically run through to tack crackers, taking some of those barrels out and being able to blend compliant low sulfur fuel oil with those rather than taking a high sulfur fuel oil stream. Lane Riggs : Paul, this is Lane. The two places that we're doing that really are Pembroke and Qu\u00e9bec, and we really don't start with a high sulfur resid. We start with something that's maybe a moderate sulfur and it depends on the crude economics, and then we start blending it up. Paul Cheng : I see. Gary and Lane, that you guys -- for the industry as a whole, do you think how much is the VGO they are going to take out for this purpose? Lane Riggs : I don't know that we have a macro view of that. But we've sort of talked all along about this idea that VGO at some point will have to maintain its parity into an FCC or the gasoline and obviously, back to this low sulfur fuel oil market. And therefore, it's supportive of gasoline, to your point earlier. It will essentially cause -- it's a linkage between FCC economics and then just straight up low sulfur fuel oil into the bunker market, which is going to be connected with diesel. So, I think a lot of people thought they'd be disconnected, but they're not. It's really through the VGO. But in terms of how much, there are compatibility issues. There's all sorts of things around this that everybody is working on, and we'll just have to see how much of it -- how much you can get into the blends. Paul Cheng : A final question. I mean, even if we can fix the -- diesel issue, I mean, that the resulting high sulfur fuel oil seems like is still going to be a problem. Do you guys have -- I mean, you don't produce it, and indeed, you are a net buyer of the resid. So, if resid price crashed down to zero, it would be great for you. Any idea that -- I mean, what is really the alternative use that we can do with all the excess high sulfur resid? Lane Riggs : It's primarily power generation that's for the other -- and we don\u2019t know the market depth of that or how much can be absorbed. I think it all depends on OPEC and how much it produces and how much substitution they can do. Instead of where they were burning crude, they can burn some of these high sulfur fuel oil. Our belief is that it's still long. Particularly once OPEC starts recovering in their production, that's why we're not -- we feel good about our assets in light of this problem that you're talking about. Paul Cheng : Lane, how easy for the industry be able to feed the high sulfur resid back into the coker and use it as a feed? I mean, you guys don't -- already doing some, but the industry as a whole, do we have a lot of opportunity doing that? Lane Riggs : I think everybody is on a learning curve on that. We've been doing it a long time. We run a lot of resids. So, we have a pretty good understanding. The issue you get into is you've got to find a way to run it and maintain your defaulter operation that's heavier, it doesn't have the light stuff, so you don't get good mixing. And there is other challenges. It depends on the configuration of the refinery. And I'm sure as it gets distressed in the marketplace, there will be a lot of -- there will be -- everybody will try to accelerate and figure out how much they can run. Joseph Gorder : Paul, it was good to see -- hear you back, and you were true to form. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Flam with Simmons Energy. Patrick Flam : I really wanted to ask you about capital spending trends so far this year. If I'm doing my math right, it looks like you've spent about $1.5 billion so far out of the $2.5 billion 2019 target, which implies to me that your spending is going to drop off into the second half of the year. I was hoping you could just walk me through the moving pieces there. And if this is a reflection of lower turnaround activity levels or lower project spending or whatever those pieces might be? Lane Riggs : It's both. This is Lane. It's both of those. We've had a pretty heavy turnaround period, and we don't have nearly as much turnaround activity for the rest of the year. And then two, you're just not as productive those last 2 or 3 months of the year because of all the holidays. So, it's really a combination of that. Joseph Gorder : Yes. It's not that unusual to find ourselves in this situation. I mean, and things will move a little bit within this. Sometimes we're slightly below, sometimes we're above, but I mean, the $2.5 billion number is just kind of our nominal expectation what we're going to spend. And again, you kind of do it as you have to, so. Lane Riggs : Well, and to that point, I mean, when we had the tube leak at Benicia, that was the turnaround that we had planned in the first quarter of 2020, that we had to bring into this year. So, we had to bring on a number -- $80 million or $90 million of turnaround spend from one year to the next. And so, some things like that can happen. Patrick Flam : Okay. Great. That's really helpful. My follow-up question is essentially -- I know you guys aren't directly impacted by this, but I was hoping you could frame up any expectations you have for longer-term market impact from the potential closure of the PES refinery on the East Coast. Gary Simmons : Yes. So obviously it's going to tighten the market there, 350,000 barrel a day refinery. That refinery produced a lot of premium gasoline, 35,000 barrels a day of premium gasoline, and our strategy in that region has been able to supply the market primarily from Pembroke. And so, we have good logistics assets in place to be able to take advantage of that short. And Pembroke is a refinery that has a lot of capability to produce octane, and so that's primarily what we're working on today. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : I actually wanted to follow up on the Philadelphia Energy refinery closure. So obviously, gasoline margins strengthened off the fire and have come back a bit. And I'm wondering what you attribute the increase to and if you think that's going to be sustained through 3Q. It seems like there's a lot of gasoline supply in the market. So, I wonder if it's a matter of months those imports kind of hit the East Coast, margins are going to fall back off or maybe there is somewhat of an octane shortage that could support gasoline margins through the rest of 3Q? And I have a follow-up. Gary Simmons : Yes. So, this is Gary. I think our view is, if you look at the DOE stats for the last couple of weeks, it looks like demand has been down. But our view is that demand will be revised back upward and that you'll see actually net exports fall off. And a lot of that is the reason that you pointed to. After the fire and announced closure, you had a $0.03 a gallon open ARB to ship gasoline from Northwest Europe to New York Harbor. And so, its incentivized imports there. PADD 5 we saw imports even after the refinery utilization came back. And then in the U.S. Gulf Coast, with the octane strength, we're seeing some import of components into the U.S. Gulf Coast as well. And so, demand is good, but the net exports, mainly due to imports being down, is kind of what's caused the build that we've seen the last couple weeks. And it does look like that the market is cooling off some, and you're already seeing signs that that's reversing, especially in PADD 5. We've gone from seeing imports to it looks like a couple refiners are putting export cargos together, and you're seeing barrels from California flow into the Arizona market to help clear that as well. So, I do think it's a trend you'll see reverse. Jason Gabelman : Do you have a view if the world is kind of maxed out on how much octane it can produce right now? Gary Simmons : Yes. I think the combination of the things Lane talked about with Tier 3 gasoline destroying some octane and then globally, refiners running a very light diet and excessing naphtha and trying to fit naphtha back into the pool has caused octane to be very tight globally. Jason Gabelman : Got it. And if I can just ask a follow-up. Mexico is working to revamp its existing refineries in addition to building a new one. But assuming they are successful on the former, it could have implications for U.S. product exports. Is Valero thinking of kind of continuing its strategy to push its logistical reach into new markets, similar to what it did in Peru to kind of combat the potential for the Mexican market to close up a bit to the U.S. for product exports? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, we currently are exporting about -- that we sell ourself about 30,000 barrels a day direct sales into Mexico. That will continue to ramp up. We're building our marine terminal in Veracruz and have a strategy in the North as well. For Mexico to do much on revamping their refining system, it involves a lot. It's not just the refineries, but it's also a lot of logistics and able to get logistics that were meant to move crude out, now to move crude in. So, it's going to be a long time coming before they can do much in terms of revamping their refining system. Joseph Gorder : Yes. I agree with Gary completely. And then if you look at the new plant that they have in mind, obviously, the capital cost is going to be much higher than they had originally forecasted. If you are a country and you want to do something as a matter of national pride, and economic returns aren't the primary driver to the investment, then something like that probably makes sense. But certainly, the most efficient way for Mexico to supply its shorts is from the U.S. Gulf Coast. Operator : And we have a question from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew Blair : Joe, I think you could say that Valero has the biggest investment in new alkylation capacity in the industry, just with your projects at Houston and St. Charles. Could you talk about how this will change your overall net exposure in alkylate? Are you net short today? And after these projects are done, would you become net long? Joseph Gorder : Gary, you or Lane? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, I don't know that -- it's all a matter of economics of where alkylate trades. So, we have flexibility where we can sell alkylate direct. The additional alkylate in the pool allows us to make more RBOB versus CBOB. And it also allows us to make a lot more export grades that are required in some of the Latin American markets. So, it will be all a matter of price of what path we choose to go, but we have flexibility to do any of those things. Matthew Blair : Sounds good. And then I think the top end of your throughput guidance for Q3 '19 is about 4% below what you did last year. I think that the turnaround schedule lightens up this quarter. Could you just talk about what the constraints are? Why the volumes are coming in fairly low for Q3? Lane Riggs : Yes. This is Lane. We don't really give -- we just give the ranges. We don't really give sort of any sort of maintenance guidance really. So as long as we did that, we don't normally give that kind of guidance. We just -- the bottom line is they are what they are. Joseph Gorder : Yes, and Matthew, you know what goes into the volume forecast. So, it is what it is. Matthew Blair : I mean, does this reflect like any sort of economic run cuts? Lane Riggs : No. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Homer Bhullar for any closing remarks. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Catherine. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Obviously, if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report that we delivered solid financial results despite challenging market conditions again this quarter. Although gasoline cracks held steady and diesel cracks improved from the previous quarter. Heavy and medium sour crude all discounts the Brent crude oil remain narrow. Its supply was constrained by geopolitical events. Also the start up of new pipelines from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast tighten the WTI Midland to Cushing crude oil differential. Despite these headwinds, we generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow. Once again, demonstrating the flexibility and strength of our assets to deliver steady earnings and free cash flow. During the quarter, we began to enjoy the benefits of our investments in the new Houston alkylation unit that was commissioned in June and from the recently completed Central Texas pipelines and terminals project. The alkylation unit upgrades lower value natural gas liquids and refinery olefins to a premium high octane outlet product. And the Central Texas pipelines and terminals reduce secondary costs and extends our supply chain from the Gulf Coast to a growing inland market. Other strategic growth projects and execution remain on target. The Pasadena terminal, St. Charles alkylation unit, and Pembroke cogeneration unit are expected to be completed next year, with the Diamond Green Diesel expansion expected to be completed in 2021 and the Port Arthur Coker in 2022. In September, our Diamond Green Diesel joint venture initiated an advanced engineering and development cost review for a new renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur Texas facility. If the projects approved, construction could begin in 2021 with operations expected to commence in 2024. This would result in Diamond Green Diesel production capacity increasing to over 1.1 billion gallons annually. The guiding framework underpinning our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We continue to expect our annual CapEx for both 2019 and 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion with $1 billion allocated for projects with high returns that are focused on market expansion and margin improvement. During the third quarter, we returned $679 million to stockholders, which represents a payout ratio of 61% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. We continue to target an annual payout ratio of 40% to 50%. Looking forward, we\u2019re encouraged. Fourth quarter market conditions are favorable. Distillate and gasoline margins are significantly higher than last quarter and this time last year supported by strong fundamentals, good demand and wider medium and heavy sour crude all discounts. In closing, our team\u2019s simple strategy of striving for operational excellence, investing to drive earnings growth with lower volatility and maintaining capital discipline with an uncompromising focus on shareholder returns has proven to be successful and positions us well for any market environment. So with that Homer, I\u2019ll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the third quarter of 2019, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $609 million or $1.48 per share, compared to $856 million or $2.1 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Operating income for the Refining segment in the third quarter of 2019 was $1.1 billion compared to $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2018. The decrease from the third quarter of 2018 is mainly attributed to narrower crude oil discounts to Brent crude oil. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.95 million barrels per day, which was 146,000 barrels per day lower than the third quarter of 2018. Throughput capacity utilization was 94% in the third quarter of 2019. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.05 per barrel, where $0.33 per barrel higher than the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher maintenance activity and lower throughput in the third quarter of 2019. The Ethanol segment generated a $43 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $21 million in operating income in the third quarter of 2018. The decrease from the third quarter of 2018 was primarily due to lower margins resulting from higher corn prices. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2019. Operating income for the Renewable Diesel segment was $65 million compared to $5 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2018. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 638,000 gallons per day in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 387,000 gallons per day versus the third quarter of 2018. The third quarter 2018 operating results and sales volumes were impacted by the plan downtime of the Diamond Green Diesel plant as part of completing an expansion project. For the third quarter of 2019, general and administrative expenses were $217 million and net interest expense was $111 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $567 million and income tax expense was $165 million in the third quarter of 2019. The effective tax rate was 21%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $9.6 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion. Valero\u2019s debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 26%. At the end of September, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. With regard to investing activities, we made $525 million of capital investments in the third quarter of 2019, of which approximately $305 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts, and regulatory compliance. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Excluding the impact from the change in working capital during the quarter, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion. Moving to financing activities, we returned $679 million to our stockholders in the third quarter. $372 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 3.9 million shares of Valero common stock. The total payout ratio was 61% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. This brings our year-to-date return to stockholders to $1.7 billion and the total payout ratio to 54% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. As of September 30, we had approximately $1.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to expect annual capital investments for both 2019 and 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion with approximately 60% allocated to sustaining the business and approximately 40% to growth. The $2.5 billion includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalyst and joint venture investments. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.71 million to 1.76 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 475,000 to 495,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $3.95 per barrel. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4.3 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, we still expect sales volumes to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2019. Operating expenses in 2019 should be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.16 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. For 2019, we expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $840 million. The annual effective tax rate is estimated at 22%. For the fourth quarter, net interest expense should be about $113 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $565 million. Lastly, we still expect the RINs expense for the year to remain between $300 million and $400 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start off with the obligatory IMO 2020 question. The cracks obviously are very strong. We\u2019re seeing spreads widening out. How much of the strength you see on the screen? Do you think it\u2019s a function of just turnaround activity versus something that\u2019s the beginning of a more sustainable IMO impact and maybe it\u2019s a 30,000 foot question here is, how do you think IMO plays out versus sustainability and the depth of impact, as we think about your model over the next couple of years? Joe Gorder : Good morning, Neil. Okay. Gary, you want to... Gary Simmons : Yes, Neil, I think, the products cracks, it\u2019s pretty difficult to be able to determine how much of the strength in the crack is IMO-related and how much is just fundamentals and supply. But we\u2019re certainly seeing a lot of indications in the market of IMO starting to impact it. I mean the things I would point to, the diesel curve is just continued to shift higher, the closer we get to the January 2020 date. On the gasoline market, we\u2019re seeing indications as well. Our view was that you would see some of these low-sulfur feedstock, the cat crackers being pulled out of the cats and put into the low-sulfur bunker market. If you look today, low-sulfur VGO is $5 over gasoline in the Gulf, which is to the point where you\u2019ll start to see people pull that out of cat crackers and put it into low-sulfur bunkers, which should impact gasoline yield moving forward. And then the big thing that I think is very visible is on the feedstock side of the business. High sulfur fuel, it traded as high as 95% of Brent earlier this year. This morning trading at 61% of Brent. The forward curve on high sulfur fuel oil was backward indicating it\u2019s going to get weaker as we go forward. And as you would expect, as high sulfur fuel oil has traded weaker we\u2019re starting to see that in the crude quality discounts. So through most of the year, we\u2019ve had heavy sour trading inside of a 10% discount to Brent. It\u2019s almost 20% discount to Brent today, Maya and WCS. I think Maya trading at 11.50% discount to Brent today. And we\u2019re seeing medium sours that get weaker as well. So I think on the feedstock side of the business, it\u2019s pretty clear, we\u2019re getting an impact not as clear, but I think we are also seeing it on the product side. Neil Mehta : Thank you. And then the follow-up question is around renewable diesel and maybe Joe, can you just talk about how you see this part of the business fitting into your long-term strategy? And then how you think about the gating factors for adding that capacity that you talked about in the call and then anything around blender\u2019s tax credit. So a lot of pieces to that, but just if you can fill in the gaps as it relates to renewable diesel, because we think it\u2019s \u2013 it can be an important part of the story going forward. Joe Gorder : Yes, I mean you took a book out of Paul Cheng\u2019s \u2013 page out of Paul Cheng\u2019s book here. You got first three questions there. I\u2019ll speak about part of it, I\u2019ll let Martin speak about part of it and Jason might want to cover kind of the probabilities for the blender\u2019s tax credit. But I mean strategically, we are a company that really makes motor fuels, and we\u2019re a company that takes their environmental responsibility and sustainability very seriously. And so when we look at the opportunities to produce products where there is going to be growth in the market and they\u2019re going to have sustainably high margins, we look to renewable diesel. We just think it\u2019s a really good business. We\u2019ve got a really good partner in Darling. And it\u2019s something that we know how to do. We know how to run these processes very well. And so it fits right down the middle of our fairway and so we feel very good about not only the returns, but overall EBITDA contributions that we\u2019re going to get from this product for a very long time to come. So Martin, you want to cover a piece of it. Martin Parrish : Sure, Joe, thanks. Yes, we\u2019re bullish on renewable diesel. We expect demand growth to be strong. You\u2019ve got the Renewable Energy Directive II in Europe now that\u2019s been extended to 2030. The California LCFS has been extended out the 2030 and calling for 20% greenhouse gas reduction in 2030. And then the recent elections in Canada would tell us, we\u2019re probably going to see a national standard in Canada, too. And then you\u2019ve got New York State. So we think the future demand for renewable diesel just looks very strong. Joe Gorder : You want to talk about blender\u2019s tax credit? Jason Fraser : Yes, this is Jason. I\u2019ll give you an update on the blenders\u2019 tax credit. As you all know, it expired at the end of 2017. Both Chambers of Congress have proposed legislation that would extend it. I think the Senate has got it going out for two years and this is back retroactive to 2018, and out for three negotiations on the BTC and other tax extenders are now taking place within the context of the appropriations process. We\u2019re optimistic it will get done, because the BTC remains one of Senate Finance Chairman, Grassley\u2019s top priorities, and there\u2019s really not a lot of opposition to it. However, this impeachment process is certainly interfering with the bipartisan cooperation that you need to get the package agreed to. So that\u2019s what\u2019s created a little, a little more uncertainty than there was before. Joe Gorder : Hey Neil, one other point I think that we\u2019d like to make on this, Martin can speak to, why isn\u2019t \u2013 why aren\u2019t we doing like 200,000 barrels a day of this, so. Martin Parrish : I think the constraints to look at is in the late feedstock market and we\u2019re confident we can source it and we\u2019re not worried about that any time soon. But that\u2019s the ultimate constraint on this as the feedstock. The feedstock supply is tied to global GDP per person, these ways feedstocks that\u2019s increasing. So we feel good about being able to source the feedstock. And our partnership with Darling, they are a global leader in this. They process 10% of the world\u2019s meat byproducts, so we feel we\u2019re in a good place on securing the feedstock. Neil Mehta : Appreciate all the perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Yes, thank you. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : Yes, couple of things to dig into a little, maybe more on the macro front. Just in terms of product demand, I recognize you can\u2019t give us absolutely clarity on what\u2019s driving what, but we\u2019ve got good cracks on even the light crude. So in spite of IMO things look better, I was just curious maybe going back to Neil\u2019s question there on how much of this might be turnarounds versus, what we\u2019re actually seeing in terms of the solid backdrop on the demand front? Gary Simmons : Yes, Roger. So I think to me, if you look at product inventories and you roll back to early August, total light products inventory was 16 million barrels above where we were in 2018 at the same time period. Now over the last two months, we\u2019ve had significant product growth such that \u2013 the last set of stats, we were 19 million barrels below where we were in 2018. So in the period of just a couple of months, you\u2019ve had a year-over-year change in total light product inventories, at 35 million barrels, which is a pretty staggering figure. And so if you look at that break it down, we see good demand, vehicle miles traveled look good, the tonnage index looks good. But then there is certainly some things that are supply driven as well. Shut down of PES, some planned and unplanned refinery outages have driven that as well and helps poor product fundamentals. But moving forward you look and gasoline sitting just a little above the five-year average range, diesels at the lower end of the five-year average range on apparent days of supply, both gasoline and diesel below the five-year average range. So the fundamentals look very good for both gasoline and distillate moving forward. Roger Read : Okay, great. And then just couple of follow-up on that. We\u2019ve obviously seen this issue in the tanker market, part of that is clearly related to IMO with ships going into the dry docks for retrofitting on the scrubbers. But I was curious as we look at the risk of some of these product tankers on the clean side moving into the crude markets chasing rates, do you think would any legit risk of tightness in product tanking markets that could impact your export story as we go forward? Gary Simmons : Yes, Roger, I think for us, most of our exports are short haul market. So we\u2019re primarily going to Mexico and South America and freight rates by get actually gives us a competitive advantage for other people trying to get to those markets. So I don\u2019t really know that it\u2019s much of a risk to us. Roger Read : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Manav Gupta : Hi guys. I had a quick macro question first. Can you talk about \u2013 a little bit about the limitations of very low-sulfur fuel oil at this stage? I\u2019m trying to understand, would shippers be more comfortable sticking to the tried and tested marine gas oil or would they actually be looking at the very low-sulfur fuel oil as a cheaper substitute in the initial stages of IMO? Gary Simmons : Yes. So we have a compliant blend that we are offering in the Corpus Christi market. We are also proceeding with the project, where we\u2019ll be able to have a low-sulfur blend in Pembroke. But we also have seen that there is a lot of challenges on being able to blend this 0.5 material especially with a lot of the low-sulfur Paraffinic crudes. So I think there is a good chance that initially ships will run marine gas oil and then gradually transition to the lower sulfur bunker material. Manav Gupta : And as I understand, that would be good for the U.S. diesel demand, right, if they continue to use marine gas oil in the initial stages? Gary Simmons : Yes, it will. And I think even with the blends we\u2019re seeing on the low-sulfur bunker material those when still contain a fairly significant percentage of distillate in the blend. And so even if they\u2019re burning the low-sulfur bunker, we still see a step change in diesel demand. Manav Gupta : A quick follow-up is, you are running a lot of light sweet crude on the Gulf Coast, almost 770,000 barrels a day, up about 25% versus last year. I\u2019m trying to understand now that we are finally seeing sour discounts widen out. Should we think that in 4Q and going ahead, there is a little bit of a switch back-to-medium and heavies, which would also solve some of the naphtha issues you had in 2Q? Gary Simmons : Yes. So that\u2019s exactly what we see. We set another record for light sweet crude processing in the third quarter. The economic signals were strongly in favor of light sweet crude. We\u2019ve been saying that we are at 1.6 million barrels a day of overall capacity and we pretty much fully utilized that in the third quarter. But certainly with the widening of the quality discount, especially the heavy sour crude are favored and we\u2019re starting to see medium sour crudes become economic as well. Manav Gupta : Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on another good quarter. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Manav. Take care. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Phil Gresh : Hey, good morning. A bit of a follow-up to Manav\u2019s question here, just in terms of your slate on the Gulf Coast, how do you think about, your ability to run high sulfur fuel oil as a feedstock? I think residuals have been about 200,000 barrels a day or so, each of the past few quarters. How much of that is high sulfur fuel oil and what kind of flexibility do you have to run more as a feedstock? Gary Simmons : So we have a lot of flexibility to do that and we have been doing some of it backing out high sulfur or heavy sour crude. And we haven\u2019t really been running high sulfur fuel, but we\u2019ve been running blend components that are going into the high sulfur fuel oil market. We\u2019ve run some of those and we expect to do more as we move forward. Phil Gresh : Okay. And then second question, obviously there is a change to the Maya formula, but obviously Maya has to be competitive regardless of what the formula is. I\u2019m just curious how you think about \u2013 how these heavy barrels on the Gulf Coast need the price, especially WCS, which seems to be discounting more, as more barrels are coming via rail, but also then you have the Middle Eastern barrels, you have the medium sours. So how do you think about how these should all price relative to each other? Gary Simmons : Yes. So we believe heavy Canadian in Maya should trade at approximately the same value. Obviously in September, PMI expected high sulfur fuel oil to trade much weaker and the formula had Maya really priced out of the market. But they made a correction in October and if you look at where both WCS and Maya are trading today, they are almost on top of each other, which is where we expect those to trade moving forward. Phil Gresh : Okay, great. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Phil. Operator : Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Prashant Rao : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Prashant. Prashant Rao : Good morning, Joe. After following up on Phil\u2019s question there, price on Maya and WCS is one factor and relatively how those are on top of each other. In market access, the barrels are moving down of the Gulf is another, as we look to Canada talking about rail above curtailment, we\u2019re starting to see \u2013 end of the curtailment start to roll off a little bit. It looks like, could we get a more Brent barrels of Canadian into the Gulf Coast market? I just wanted to get a sense of what you\u2019re seeing out there and maybe give us a sense of what you can get on sort of a firm versus delivered basis for barrels and how does that play any further into kind of that Maya versus U.S. dynamic pricing of the curve? Gary Simmons : Yes. So we\u2019re in ongoing negotiations with several producers in Western Canada on delivered rail volume. We have our Lucas rail facility that feed support Arthur refinery and a lot of capacity to run-heavy Canadian there. And we anticipate as we move through the fourth quarter, you will see rail volumes ramp up as \u2013 and we anticipate we\u2019ll buy those barrels delivered on something equivalent to the WCS or Maya equivalent in the Gulf. Prashant Rao : Okay, great. And then other factor, another question is just a follow-up on the ethanol, that\u2019s a smaller segment, but I just wanted to get a sense of how you see the next couple of quarters playing out? And when we could start to see potentially EBIT going back into the black on ethanol? What do we need to see to sort of give us the first time post that that\u2019s swings to the positive, because obviously that could be incremental upside there too in the quarter\u2019s ahead if factors play out right? Martin Parrish : So this is Martin. I think near-term October is looking a lot better than the third quarter did. What you\u2019ve seen is the recent DoE data. What the issue has been is oversupply in the U.S. right. Inventory is just too low, which is pressuring margins. The production is trending lower, ethanol inventory now on the weekly data is 2.5 million barrels lower than this time last year. And then long-term, we\u2019re still bullish. Ethanol is going to be in the U.S. gasoline mix for the long run. We expect to see some small incremental demand in the U.S. from higher octane and fuel efficiency standards and some small incremental demand from year round E15 sales. And then we expect, really the big thing we expect is a rebound and the export growth due to favorable blend economics, just the economics to blending ethanol and then these global renewable fuel mandates. So we still feel very constructive in the long-term and think that\u2019s going to be around the corner. Prashant Rao : All right, thank you very much for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Hey guys, good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi, Paul. Paul Cheng : I think I have two questions. One, maybe is for Gary, I think. So I would try to stick to just two, not multiple. That before we sit, Gary, you mentioned that you haven\u2019t really fit the high sulfur, we sit directly to the Coker. Is that something that you guys believe technically, given the way economic you can do? And does it matter whether it\u2019s a delayed Coker or as a forward Coker. Lane Riggs : Hey Paul, it\u2019s Lane. We\u2019ve historically ran quite a \u2013 what Gary was talking about was we run a lot of outside blend stocks that go into a 3.5% fuel oil and we\u2019ve always done that. And it\u2019s a part of the market that we feel like we understand technically maybe better than a lot of the people in the industry. And one of the critical strategy is going into this, towards going in IMO have to make sure you keep connectivity between these feedstocks and the heavy crudes and we work really hard at doing that. There are technical challenges. They are around defaulting and some of the other things, but we are very focused on increasing amount of heavy sours that we run. Paul Cheng : Lane, so you\u2019re saying that you won the heavy sour, the crude or you won the heavy sour we see, I\u2019m sorry? Lane Riggs : We do both, but your question was around resid and... Paul Cheng : Right. Lane Riggs : So the earlier question was, are you running more fuel oil and we don\u2019t really run fuel oil per se. What we run is we run the blend stocks that go into 3.5%. And so as you see that as people unwind that as a fuel, you\u2019re going to see more of these components around the world become available. And the key is going out there and understanding and technically and fitting into our system, which we\u2019re working very aggressively to do that. Paul Cheng : How about the second part of my question, whether that make any difference that \u2013 whether it\u2019s a fully Coker or delayed Coker and your ability to won those? Lane Riggs : Not really. Paul Cheng : Not really, okay. And that Joe for \u2013 you have strong cash flow and continue to do so. Your balance sheet is in good shape, but given the uncertainty in the economy. Will that makes sense to move part of the free cash to pay down debt to really draw down the debt to a much lower level at some point that we may get hit by recession, we don\u2019t know when, but at some point in may? Joe Gorder : Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Paul. I will let Donna speak to that. Donna Titzman : No, I actually think our balance sheet is in good shape. We do have additional debt capacity to go. I don\u2019t think our ratings are in jeopardy. We have good liquidity today. So again, I\u2019m not \u2013 don\u2019t believe that paying down debt right now is necessary. Joe Gorder : Yes, there is really nothing to tell, Paul\u2026 Donna Titzman : Well, it\u2019s very expensive. You\u2019re right, our next maturity is in 2025 and to try to get that called early with the expensive and uneconomical to us. Paul Cheng : That\u2019s it. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate : Thank you and good morning everyone. Good morning, Joe. Joe Gorder : How are you doing Doug? Homer Bhullar : How are you Doug? Doug Leggate : I should probably thank Paul for making room for the rest of us, so I thank them as well. So, I just go two quick questions, Joe. Obviously, IMO is the focus for the whole market right now. My question really is more about, this year perspective on duration of any perceived benefit. To give it, to explain my question will further, our view is that the industry can react to the product side it, with things like your VGO, reallocation and things of that nature. The stickier side of it seems to be on the sour feedstock. So I just want to get your perspective as do you think that the product side of it is more sticky as well? In which case, what does it mean for like gasoline balance given what you described in your prepared remarks about VGO? Maybe explain your experience of what you\u2019ve done with VGO and how you expect to operate going forward? And I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up please. Joe Gorder : Okay. Gary and Lane can speak to this. You know, Paul, I mean, Doug, excuse me, if you recall probably for 18 months or something, we\u2019ve been talking about the first \u2013 the prospects from IMO and it\u2019s kind of shaping up the way that we had anticipated. The one issue and the guys can speak to this in addition to your question is, how do you solve the circumstances that IMO creates in the market, okay. Who comes in and solves the problem around the 3.5% weight fuel oil? So you guys want to speak to it in general and then\u2026 Lane Riggs : Yes, I\u2019ll start and then of course, Gary, can always tune it up a little bit later here, we \u2013 Joe alluded to this, we sort of played out the way that we thought, and I think ultimately early on, you\u2019re going to have this demand for diesel. It will be interesting to see how long that goes. I mean, it could go on for quite some time depending on the technical difficulty of making those fuels. And we have seen some of that like Gary alluded to it. It is not an easy task to create to make all the fuels work from a compatibility perspective. But longer term, the 3.5% weight, I\u2019m making that not having a home for it is a much \u2013 the capital \u2013 a much more capital intensive thing to try to work through. And somebody alluded \u2013 was asking the question earlier about valuations of crude. What will be interesting is, right now, I would say these crudes are \u2013 to the extent that heavy sour and medium sour are running not \u2013 they\u2019re not being value based on an open culture, but they\u2019re being valued based on 3.5% weight. You could see it \u2013 you\u2019re going to see that disconnect even get greater. I don\u2019t know that we know \u2013 you can think about all the path to try to close that gap, but it all takes quite a bit of capital. Gary Simmons : Yes, I think a lot of uncertainty. We certainly anticipated, you\u2019d see scrubbers come online, but it appears there\u2019s a lot of technical issues around the scrubbers that maybe they don\u2019t come on as fast as what we thought. And then the other area here that would uncertainty is when does some of this production that\u2019s offline, some of these medium and heavy sour crudes, when do they come back on the market. So very difficult to give you a timeline. Joe Gorder : But it\u2019s... Doug Leggate : I think you were trying to answer it, go on Joe, sorry. Joe Gorder : It\u2019s not a problem that\u2019s going to get resolved very quickly. I think, again we\u2019ve always kind of played down the whole product side of this, but I think we\u2019ve expected more on the feedstock side. We\u2019re seeing it in both right now, but this is going to take a while to solve. Doug Leggate : Thanks for attempting to answer guys. I know it\u2019s a really tough one, but obviously constructive for you guys in particular. My follow-up and either Joe or Donna, whoever wants to take this, but the balance between buybacks and dividends, specific to Valero, you\u2019re operating better than any other refinery in the industry, frankly, in terms of your execution, you reliability, in terms of markets. You know consistency of delivering to the market, but your buyback and dividend is still pretty skewed I guess. What is the right level for that, especially as your share price goes up? I know you\u2019ve always been pretty sensitive to buying back stock. When you get some kind of periodic strengthening in margins and obviously the industry. So do we see a step-up in the dividend or maybe a rebalancing of how you return cash? And I\u2019ll leave it there, thanks. Joe Gorder : Yes, I\u2019ll let Donna talk to this. Because \u2013 I mean, Doug, obviously there is not a formulaic approach to how you do this, right. I mean, you\u2019ve going to have your outlook for the market going forward. Obviously, we felt it has been pretty good, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had a significant dividend increases. We have had \u2013 and you want to be competitive from a yield perspective, not only with your peers but with the broader market. So all those things taken into consideration, but not as far as the mix\u2026 Donna Titzman : Yes, so I mean we do view that dividend as it is very important part of the total shareholder return, but it\u2019s also important to us that it is sustainable. So we want it to be very competitive in the market generally and specifically against our peers. But we also want to be able to sustain that dividend through the earnings cycle. So we always continue to look at that mix. We always continue to review it. Joe Gorder : Yes. And you noticed that we did more on the buyback side this quarter than we did the previous quarter. And we haven\u2019t altered our approach and when we say, we look at ratability plus, we look at buying on dips and frankly we had a situation where we\u2019re looking into a strong fourth quarter with the prospects for IMO. We said it\u2019s a good time to buy back more shares. So that\u2019s what we did in the third quarter. So we took advantage of an opportunity, and we\u2019ll do that going forward. Doug Leggate : Would we expect the buyback to slow if you did \u2013 let\u2019s say, you were 20% higher, would you still be buying back your shares? Joe Gorder : If we were 20% higher, it all goes to... Doug Leggate : As you know, it\u2019s a cyclical business obviously. So you buy back. You know at some point is going to drop again probably, so I guess, how do you respond to continue strengthening? Joe Gorder : So, well, we are going to adhere to our 40% to 50% payout ratio. And Doug, it doesn\u2019t make sense in this business to jostle things around on an ongoing basis. You set your target and you work to achieve and it gives you consistency, not only with what the financial markets are going to expect from you, but operationally what you can afford to invest in and how you can grow the business. And so that\u2019s why we said this, capital allocation framework in place several years ago and we have adhered to it totally since then and it seems to work out. So don\u2019t make any forecast dividend increases and at all, we just rely on the fact that we had told you what we\u2019re going to do and we\u2019re going to do it. Doug Leggate : Great answer. Thanks Joe. Appreciate it. Joe Gorder : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Sam Margolin : Good morning everybody, hi. Joe Gorder : Hi, Sam. Sam Margolin : I have a follow-up on renewable diesel actually. It\u2019s \u2013 the location of the project you\u2019re evaluating a Port Arthur, in the context of the comment around feedstock constraints, can you just talk a little bit about why that location is a good one? It seems like you operate in places that might have more local biomass. Are you importing or is it the marketing thing or you\u2019re exporting? I\u2019m asking because as this business scales be good to know just sort of the factors that you look at for performance? Martin Parrish : Yes, this is Martin. I mean the thing that helps renewable diesel is being co-located with the refinery. So that\u2019s probably the primary thing we\u2019re looking at and in place where we can hit all the markets. So that really drives you to the Gulf Coast and were driven in the United States just because of the \u2013 the feedstock supply in the U.S. per installed base of renewable diesel is better than anywhere else in the world. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re heading to reviewing Port Arthur and doing the engineering analysis on it. Sam Margolin : Okay, thanks. So it\u2019s a combination of placement and feedstock, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then, we\u2019re like six weeks since the uptake stabilizer went down in Saudi, people who count the ships coming out of the Gulf see stable exports. But can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing as far as high sulfur to sour crude supply, if there\u2019s been any change in mix from the Middle East as far as feedstock quality or crude quality that you\u2019re seeing in the interim here as that facility gets repaired? Gary Simmons : Yes, Sam, this is Gary. We haven\u2019t really purchased any Saudi volume in quite some time. And so I can\u2019t really give you a comment. We\u2019re running some Iraqi and Kuwait. It\u2019s primarily due to the West Coast, which has been unaffected, but we don\u2019t see any Saudi volume coming into our system at all. Sam Margolin : All right. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC. Your line is now open. Brad Heffern : Hi, everyone. Question on exports. So when I was looking at the numbers for last year for the third quarter, I think you guys exported over 400,000 barrels a day. This year was just a little over 300,000, is that demand pull into the U.S. Is that export weakness or is there some other factor that I\u2019m not thinking of? Joe Gorder : Yes, Brad. I think you kind of hit on it. The only thing I would tell you is, Port Arthur is one of our large export locations and we were doing some dredging work on the dock there, which did limit us a little bit, but the big driver was what you pointed to, that\u2019s an optimization for us and it is demand pull and with the large life product inventory draws we saw in the U.S., we had a better net back going into the domestic markets and that\u2019s what drove it rather than lack of demand into the export markets. Brad Heffern : Okay, got it. And then a question on refining OpEx. So this quarter just phenomenal number was $1.1 billion. When I think back a couple of years ago it used to be in the 900s or even the high 800 sometimes. Is there any underlying factor that\u2019s driven at higher OpEx number? Joe Gorder : It\u2019s easier for me to sort of compare it to year-over-year by the way rigs. Our volumes were down in the third quarter, largely we had three external power failure, then we had the storm deal with they went through and affected our Port Arthur operations. Our volumes weren\u2019t as high as they were with these, part of that is just on per barrel basis, it\u2019s a little bit higher and then some other thing. We\u2019ve changed what is in and out of our operations and we did have the MLP out, now it\u2019s back in. We have Diamond Green Diesel, which used to be in, it\u2019s out. So there are some changes like that has occurred over time as well. Brad Heffern : Okay, nothing structural? Joe Gorder : No, nothing structural. Brad Heffern : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Your line is now open. Jason Gabelman : Yes, hi, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow-up on something Roger Read asked around, the higher shipping rates. Obviously, there are some near-term volatility in those rates, but I think the market is expecting shipping rates both on the crude and product side to be structurally higher than they were in kind of the first half of this year. Can you just talk from a totality perspective for Valero, how those higher rates impact the Company\u2019s earnings? I guess both on the product side and maybe lifting global refining margins and then also on the feedstock side in higher blended feedstock costs? Thanks. Gary Simmons : Sure. I\u2019ll start on the feedstock side. Obviously with the \u2013 we\u2019ve been running, we\u2019re running a lot of pipeline delivered crude and then a lot of the barrels were getting over the water, short haul barrel. So we don\u2019t see a big impact on our feedstock costs and similarly on the products, the barrels are going in the domestic markets, or we export to fairly short haul locations in Mexico and South America. So not a material impact. Some of the long-haul barrels that we do run, we do have some freight protection on those as well, which helps. Obviously, the big thing that we\u2019ve seen is been positive to the business, as freight rates is spiked, Joe mentioned in his opening comments that the Brent TI spread had come in with the pipeline capacity coming online, but with the freight rates spiking we\u2019ve seen Brent TI blow back out some and back over $5, which obviously gives U.S. refining a significant advantage on running light sweet crude. And as I mentioned previously into our export location, when you\u2019re going to Mexico, the higher freight rates actually give us a competitive advantage over some of our global refining competitors trying to import to those markets. Jason Gabelman : All right, thanks for that. I appreciate that color. And then if I could ask just on the Syncrude marketing kind of the northern crude market, because I know you guys run a decent amount Syncrude to Quebec. It seems like there\u2019s going to be some changes in the balances in terms of and operator maybe using less Syncrude for diluent and then the Northwest refinery up there switching from running Syncrude to WCS. Do you see a shift in kind of the pricing paradigm for Syncrude and maybe that bleeding into Bakken, emerging over the next few months into 2020? Gary Simmons : Well, it\u2019s interesting. Syncrude obviously in an IMO environment could be a premium price crude. So we have a lot of optimization opportunities on what we spent through line nine and I think our view would probably see \u2013 we see a little bit more Bakken than we see syn going to Quebec as we move forward in an IMO environment. Jason Gabelman : All right, thanks a lot. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Flam with Simmons Energy. Your line is now open. Patrick Flam : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. My first question is basically, I was hoping you guys could frame up your thoughts around the recent proposed changes to the RFS program. Obviously, you guys are partially hedged to any changes by way of your ethanol and bio-diesel operations, but it seems like any reallocation of volumes lost to small refinery exemptions, would kind of come back on you as a larger operators? I was hoping you could give some context to those changes politically? Joe Gorder : All right. Jason is on. Jason Fraser : Yes, hi, this is Jason. You\u2019re right. On October 15th, the EPA released their supplemental RVO asking for public comment on, included in the formula the prior three years average of SREs, but the DOE recommended be granted. I know that a lot of words there. That\u2019d be about 580 million gallons or 770 million gallons. To put it on which prior three years to use and they ask for comments on both. And then these obligations will be reobligated on the other non-exempt refiners in addition to your normal share. You should get what you already get and then you get this on top. So our industry and many members of Congress have been clear that reallocating SREs on the other obligated parties like this is unworkable and we view it as a violation of fundamental fairness to those of us who already bearing our burden onto the program. It then may also be illegal. It\u2019s especially frustrating because it has been shown time and again by the EIA on data that granting this SREs in the past, as they\u2019ve done it with no reallocation has no negative effect on ethanol blending on actual liquid volume they got moved, but this is simply no real ethanol demand destruction. Joe Gorder : So the reallocation, he was asking about the impact of the reallocation on us, so the SREs, I mean it obviously is going to cost more for us to comply with a larger volume obligation. It\u2019s not, I wouldn\u2019t call it material, but if it was $0.01, we wouldn\u2019t like it. So anyway, we\u2019re going to do what we can to help deal with this. Patrick Flam : Okay, great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. My second question is kind of a more detailed question back on the Diamond Green Diesel segment. It appears that in the third quarter sales volume came in pretty low and in order to meet that 750,000 gallons a day, full-year target, it seems like the fourth quarter will have to step up pretty materially. Is there any context, you can give around why that might be the case? Jason Fraser : We had guidance for the full year of 750,000 and we still expect to make that. We expect a strong fourth quarter. We had a scheduled catalyst change in the third quarter and that\u2019s why we guided the 750,000 gallons per day for the year to begin with. So we feel pretty good about the numbers. Patrick Flam : Okay, great. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning everyone. I was hoping you could give a sense of how your 2020 turnaround schedule compares to 2019? Lane Riggs : Hi, Matthew. This is Lane Riggs. We don\u2019t give any real forward guidance to our turnaround schedule of the policy. Matthew Blair : Okay. And then West Coast cracks got off to a great start in Q4, it have come down a little bit here. How have your two California refineries run so far this quarter and would you expect to capture all this upside? Lane Riggs : Yes. This is Lane again. We ran pretty \u2013 we ran well and we continue to run well. We had one small blip on our San Francisco area refinery, but other than that it wasn\u2019t that meaningful to the performance around, they\u2019ve been for run a pretty well through all this. Matthew Blair : Sounds good. Thanks. Operator : I\u2019m showing no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Bhuller for closing remarks. Homer Bhullar : Thanks guys. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Obviously, please feel free to reach out to the IR team if you have any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2018s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Homer Bhullar. Thank you. Please go ahead sir. Homer Bhullar : Good morning everyone and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joseph Gorder : Thanks Homer and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report that we had a good quarter delivering solid financial results. Our refineries operated well at 96% utilization allowing us to take advantage of wider sour crude oil differentials and weakness in high sulfur residual feedstocks. Overall, 2019 was a challenging environment for the refining business. We started the year with gasoline inventories at record highs and gasoline cracks at historic lows. We were also faced with narrow sour crude oil differentials for most of the year, primarily due to sanctions on Venezuela and Iran in addition to OPEC and Canadian crude oil production curtailments. And differentials on inland sweet crude oils narrowed in the second half of the year with the start-up of multiple new crude pipelines from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast. Despite this challenging backdrop, our team demonstrated the strength of our assets and prior investments to improve our feedstock and product flexibility allowing us to deliver another year of steady earnings and free cash flow. We demonstrated our crude supply flexibility by processing an annual record of 1.4 million barrels per day of North American sweet crude oil as well as a record of approximately 180,000 barrels per day of Canadian heavy crude oil in 2019. We also achieved another milestone by delivering the best ever year on employee safety performance and the lowest number of environmental events in company history, demonstrating our strong commitment to safety, reliability and environmental stewardship. We continue to invest in projects that enhance the flexibility and margin capability of our portfolio. In 2019, we successfully started up the Houston alkylation unit and completed the Central Texas Pipelines and Terminals Project. And we have several growth projects that will be completed this year including the Pasadena terminal, St. Charles alkylation units and the Pembroke cogeneration unit. Looking further out, the Diamond pipeline expansion should be completed in 2021 and the Diamond Green Diesel and the Port Arthur Coker projects are still on track to be completed in 2021 and 2022, respectively. We also continue to explore growth opportunities in our renewable fuels business, which is already the largest in North America. As we previously announced, the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture is in the advanced engineering review phase for a new renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur, Texas facility. If the project is approved, operations are expected to commence in 2024, which will result in Diamond Green Diesel\u2019s renewable fuels production capacity increasing to over 1.1 billion gallons annually or over 70,000 barrels per day. We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, a constant in our strategy for several years, which prioritizes our investment grade credit rating, sustaining investments and maintaining a sustainable and growing dividend. We expect our annual CapEx for 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion, which is consistent with our average annual spend over the last six years with approximately $1 billion allocated for high return growth projects that are focused on market expansion and margin improvement and the balance allocated to maintain safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operations. And you should continue to expect incremental discretionary cash flow to compete with other discretionary uses including organic growth investments, M&A and cash returns to our investors. Looking ahead, we have a favorable outlook for refining margins with the IMO 2020 low sulfur fuel oil regulation, which just took effect on January 1. High sulfur crude oils are expected to be more discounted due to lower demand as less complex refineries switched to sweeter crude oils. Valero\u2019s complex refining system is well positioned to take advantage of the discounted high sulfur crudes and fuel oils as feedstocks. And our growing renewable diesel segment continues to generate strong results due to the high demand for renewable fuels. In closing, our incredible team\u2019s relentless focus on operational excellence, a steady pipeline of high-return organic growth projects and a demonstrated commitment to shareholder returns should continue to position Valero well. So with that Homer, I\u2019ll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the fourth quarter of 2019, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.1 billion or $2.58 per share compared to $952 million or $2.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Fourth quarter 2019 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $873 million or $2.13 per share compared to $932 million or $2.19 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018. For 2019, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.4 billion or $5.84 per share compared to $3.1 billion or $7.29 per share in 2018. 2019 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.4 billion or $5.70 per share compared to $3.2 billion or $7.55 per share in 2018. The 2018 and 2019 adjusted results exclude several items reflected in the financial tables that accompany the earnings release. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to those financial tables. Operating income for the refining segment in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018. Refining throughput volumes averaged three million barrels per day, which was in line with the fourth quarter of 2018. Throughput capacity utilization was 96% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.93 per barrel were in line with the fourth quarter of 2018. The ethanol segment generated $36 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a $27 million operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily due to higher margins resulting from higher ethanol prices. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.3 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was $541 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $101 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. After adjusting for the retroactive blenders tax credit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $187 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $167 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales volume. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 844,000 gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 124,000 gallons per day versus the fourth quarter of 2018. For the fourth quarter of 2019, general and administrative expenses were $243 million and net interest expense was $119 million. General and administrative expenses for 2019 of $868 million were lower than 2018, mainly due to adjustments to our environmental liabilities in 2018. For the fourth quarter of 2019, depreciation and amortization expense was $571 million and income tax expense was $326 million. The effective tax rate was 20% for 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the unfavorable impact from the change in working capital of $434 million and our joint venture partner\u2019s 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel\u2019s net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changing in its working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion. With regard to investing activities, we made $722 million of capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2019 of which approximately $445 million was for sustaining the business including cost for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance. For 2019, we invested $2.7 billion, which includes all of Diamond Green Diesel\u2019s capital investments of $160 million. Excluding our partner\u2019s 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel\u2019s capital investments, Valero\u2019s capital investments for 2019 were approximately $2.6 billion with approximately $1 billion of the total for growing the business. Moving to financing activities. We returned $591 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter. $369 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 2.3 million shares of Valero common stock. This brings our 2019 return to stockholders to $2.3 billion and the total payout ratio to 47% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, we had approximately $1.5 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. And last week, our Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.98 per share, or $3.92 per share annually further demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our investors. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $9.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $2.6 billion. Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 26%. At the end of December, we had $5.3 billion of available liquidity excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect annual capital investments for 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion, with approximately 60% allocated to sustaining the business and approximately 40% to growth. The $2.5 billion includes expenditures for turnarounds catalysts and joint venture investments. For modeling, our first quarter operations we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.63 million to 1.68 million barrels per day; U.S. mid-continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 230,000 to 250,000 barrels per day, and North Atlantic at 470,000 to 490,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.15 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4.2 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2020. Operating expenses in 2020 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.20 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $113 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $560 million. For 2020, we expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $860 million. The annual effective tax rate is estimated at 22%. Lastly, we expect RINs expense for the year to be between $300 million and $400 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to answer questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Phil Gresh : Hey. Good morning. Joseph Gorder : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gresh : So first question two part question. I was wondering, if you could discuss in the fourth quarter what incremental actions Valero took in order to run more fuel oil as a feedstock across the portfolio? And how much of that you\u2019re actually able to capture in the quarter? As well as why you think the high sulfur fuel oil prices have started to strengthen here in the beginning of 2020? Lane Riggs : Hey, Phil, it\u2019s Lane. I\u2019ll start with - in terms of how we may be looked at our operating conditions and our operating envelope and then Gary can sort of finish up with the market. On the operating condition, we widened our window - our operating window to try to reach out and get more challenging high sulfur resid. We always - we\u2019ve for years and years and years really for decade, we\u2019ve been somebody who buys a lot of high sulfur resid to run, but we opened up to market [indiscernible] we believe the idea was - as the market changed and try to conform or at least to the IMO 2020 to some of these high sulfur resid would free up in the marketplace. And so we - and we want to get it the resid before it gets blended into the high sulfur fuel oil market because of quality reasons. So, that\u2019s really what we did. We reached out and ran quite a few high sulfur resid that we have not historically ran. Gary Simmons : Yes. So, the second part of that in terms of I guess - how much of it showed up in the fourth quarter. We ran a lot of high sulfur resid, but we really didn\u2019t see the discounted barrels coming in until about mid-December. So, it didn\u2019t have a real significant impact on fourth quarter results and you\u2019ll see that more going forward. But in terms of high sulfur fuel getting more expensive, it\u2019s -- we\u2019re still in the very early phase of what\u2019s a significant transition in our industry as we respond to the IMO bunkers sulfur spec change. And so with a change of the magnitude, you would expect it to create some volatility in the markets and it will take some time for the markets to reach equilibrium. So, we certainly see that there\u2019s not a lot of liquidity in the physical fuel oil markets we - there\u2019s a lot more liquidity in the paper markets. If you look at the forward curve steeply backwardated and kind of showing fuel gets back to 60%, 65% of Brent which is kind of more where we think it will be. So, our view really in respect to high sulfur fuel oil and the crude oil quality discounts hasn\u2019t changed. As the markets normalize, we expect to see the discount widen back out as the forward curve reflects, and as high sulfur fuel blend stocks have to compete for space with heavy sour crudes and complex refining capacity like we have in the Gulf Coast. Phil Gresh : Okay. Got it. Thank you. The second question just on the capital allocation side of things. You continue to keep capital spending flattish here in 2020 and you had a really healthy dividend increase that you just announced which looks pretty well covered by cash flow. So, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about this increase in the dividend? And is it just a shift from the dividend to the buyback and you\u2019re sticking with the same constructs that you\u2019ve had 40% to 50% of cash flow? And obviously, the buyback will reduce the dividend burden over time, but just curious how you\u2019re thinking about all this today. Thanks. Donna Titzman : No, we haven\u2019t changed our policy and it continues to be that we want to return 40% to 50% of the cash flow from operations to the shareholders. The dividend increase is just a part of that payout. We don\u2019t have anything particular in mind in regards to the dividend only payout. It\u2019s just part of the overall cash return. You might see that dividend as a percentage of the total vary each year as our cash flow varies, but buybacks will continue to fill in the balance of that return. Phil Gresh : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Manav Gupta : Joe, could you talk a little bit about the Gulf Coast operating results, you were almost up 75% on operating income on the Gulf Coast. And the context I\u2019m trying to understand this is like you have global majors one of which indicated that downstream earnings could be down 80% quarter-over-quarter. Another one reported today downstream earnings down 36%. How is Valero in an alternate universe that you are so much better than others? Joseph Gorder : Manav, that\u2019s a really good question and I\u2019d love to give you an intelligent answer, but why don\u2019t I get one of these guys cover it here. Gary, Lane. Lane Riggs : Yeah. So Manav, which - I mean first of all, we did higher discounts crude oil discounts and obviously the resid discount in the fourth quarter. So if you\u2019re comparing third quarter to the fourth quarter that\u2019s part of the answer. The second part of the answer is we got better naphtha - better naphtha netbacks because naphtha price has improved over the quarter. And again, we also [indiscernible] butane. So butane when you compare fourth quarter to third quarter is our ability to run cheaper butane or at least blended obviously helped us with our capture rate when compared to the third quarter. Manav Gupta : A quick follow-up on the renewable diesel and the expansion of targeted for late 2021. You guys have indicated a normalized margin of only 125 versus 180 or something you realized in this quarter without BTC. But if you put the basic even 125, you could get like $250 million EBITDA on the base margin and then about another $140 million. So you\u2019re looking at a return of like $390 million of EBITDA on this project. So from your capital expenditure point of $550 million, it looks like a two-year payback on this entire project? Like is the math right or is something off here? Martin Parrish : We feel pretty good about it, Manav. This is Martin Parrish. We still feel good about the pro forma guidance of the $126 million. That excludes the blender\u2019s tax credit. So that puts you at $2.26 per gallon EBITDA. I think that kind of checks out with what you\u2019re saying. Manav Gupta : Thanks, guys. Martin Parrish : Thanks. Joseph Gorder : Yes. So Manav, you\u2019re very close. Manav Gupta : Thank you. Joseph Gorder : You bet. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate : Hey, good morning guys. Joe I think this is the first time we\u2019ve spoken this year so happy New Year. Joseph Gorder : Thank you. Same to you Doug. Doug Leggate : Joe, I got one on the market and one on Valero. Let\u2019s go with Valero first. Maybe Donna wants to take this. But Phil already asked about the payout, the 40%, 50% of your cash flow payout. I guess I\u2019m more curious on the mix with the dividend. I mean you were very early to get on this trend of returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders and it\u2019s paid part in the fund. But it has paid dividends in both the credibility of the business model as well as the relative performance of the stock, but why not more dividends over buybacks? I\u2019m just curious how you think about that? Joseph Gorder : Do you want to take it crack at it? Donna Titzman : Sure. So look we have told - we\u2019ve explained to the market that we do consider that dividend to be part of the nondiscretionary piece of our capital allocation. So when we look at that we look at it in the context of it being [attentive] [ph] to the market with our peers and the market in general, but also more importantly sustainable through market cycles. So again, we regularly review that with those objectives in mind. Joseph Gorder : Doug, what I would - and Donna is exactly right. What I would add to what she said, you\u2019ve got the sustainability aspect in a down market cycle which is something that we spend a lot of time looking at to be sure that we don\u2019t find ourselves cutting the dividend. And you reinforce that by having a very strong balance sheet. But if I think about it longer-term, okay, and this is really where my brain goes, it goes to the sustainability of the growth of the dividend going forward. And we want to continue to be able to grow. We want to give our owners more every year. And the way that you go about doing that is tempering it a little bit. I think we started talking last year about moderating the dividend a little bit more, which I think you saw we did this year. And the other thing that\u2019s really encouraging from my perspective is it, we\u2019ve got these capital projects that are coming on stream. They are providing significant future earnings potential. And some of them are longer cash flow cycles, which we haven\u2019t done a lot over the last bunch of years, but I mean, we got another renewable diesel plant, we\u2019ve got the Coker. And then if we end up doing the Port Arthur renewable diesel plant in the future. These are huge EBITDA producing projects, which are going to really reinforce our ability to go ahead and continue to deliver dividend growth going forward. Now, I\u2019m not making you a promise, because Lord only knows what might happen, but that would be our objective. And that\u2019s kind of the way we look at investing our capital. The component part, the percentage of the total payout that\u2019s made up of the dividend, that the dividend comprises, that\u2019s not formulaic. It\u2019s more us looking at all of the factors involved. And there\u2019s a lot of sausage-making that takes place there that we won\u2019t get into here. But I always want to be in a position when we do something like this to let you know that we feel fairly assured that this isn\u2019t going to be an issue going forward. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the lengthy answer guys. My follow-up Joe, I don\u2019t know if you want to throw this to one of the guys, and may I also offer my congratulations to the new officers titles in the team. But maybe Lane want to take this. But there\u2019s a lot of chatter about new capacity coming online in back end of this year and maybe for the next couple of years. Obviously, things are kind of soft, it seems on the demand side given what\u2019s going on with China. But I\u2019m just wondering how you see the prognosis for the short-term IMO tailwinds transitioning maybe into a more challenging refining environment longer term? Are you guys thinking about that? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Joseph Gorder : Thanks, Doug. Lane Riggs : Yeah. So I think for at least next year to two years, we see global oil demand growth kind of keeping pace with the capacity additions and we still think we have favorable balances between production and consumption. But then yeah, we start to show two to three years out that capacity additions start to outpace global oil demand growth. And at that time, we would expect to see some rationalization in the industry. Doug Leggate : So the next couple of years you\u2019re not concerned about -- I mean, obviously, Amoco has got a bunch of stuff coming online and then Asia kicks up 21, 22 so you\u2019re not concerned about the short that kind of medium-term outlook then? Lane Riggs : No. We still show that oil demand growth outpaces capacity addition for the short term. Doug Leggate : Okay. We\u2019ll watch this. I\u2019ll watch with interest guys and looking forward to seeing you in March at our conference. Thanks. Joseph Gorder : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Paul Sankey : Good morning, all. If I could sort of follow-up on that. Hi, guys. Joe, you ran higher than we expected in every region. Could you talk about them and that\u2019s obviously versus your guidance. Could you talk about the pattern of higher volume? I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a volume mass issue there. But certainly your capture suggests that\u2019s not the right direction to be looking in. And furthermore once you\u2019ve hopefully helped explain how come you\u2019re running at the levels that you are right across the system, could you - and this is a follow-up to the previous question. Could you talk about any expectations you have for shutdowns in refining if margins stay extremely weak and potentially get worse with this whole situation in China? Thanks. Joseph Gorder : Okay. So, Paul we\u2019ll look - we\u2019re kind of looking at each other let us give -- take a crack at this and then we\u2019ll give you the opportunity if we\u2019re not answering your question to follow-up. Okay. Lane Riggs : Hey, Paul. This is Lane. I\u2019ll start. We\u2019ve had a long strategy really dating back to 2011 to work in a very organized way on our reliability projects and what we\u2019ve seen is our refining system has gone from say 95% to 96% availability all the way up to sort of over 97% availability and that\u2019s helped us. We\u2019re available when the market\u2019s right and been able to perform better. And in addition to that we do believe that we\u2019re the best in the industry in terms of understanding what feedstocks go where in the systems that we\u2019re in and we\u2019re highly adaptable to that. So, I think that helps us versus some other people in terms of our capture rates. Paul Sankey : Lane could you just dig in a little bit on that better than anyone else arguing because to an extent I guess the computer programs commoditized or not? If you could just go a bit down that that would be grateful. Thanks. Lane Riggs : It\u2019s interesting you would say they\u2019re commoditized because everybody have tools. Everybody believes that they\u2019re all implementing these tools and to some degree or another. I would say that I believe we are more integrated and more aligned on making sure that our tools are characterized the fees and we understand our units very well. It\u2019s one thing to have the tool. Sometimes people have tools, but they don\u2019t use the tools. We have a world-class planning and economics group when they do a fantastic job coordinating with our refineries in terms of having those sub models very well understood. Therefore we understand the operating envelopes and how those feedstocks are characterized in our systems. Paul Sankey : Yes. I mean I guess further to a previous question, we\u2019ve seen big mega oil so you would think have a similar structure in terms of the refining footprint to you guys wildly underperforming against what you guys are achieving. So, it\u2019s just interesting to try and establish what the competitive advantage is. Joseph Gorder : Well, we appreciate you saying that Paul. Lane Riggs : Yes, thank you. Joseph Gorder : And then the follow-up question was on capacity? Lane Riggs : Yes. So, I think the situation in the Far East is just developing. And it\u2019s really too early for us to be able to judge the magnitude of the impact that\u2019s going to have and whether it leads to refinery shutting down or not. Joseph Gorder : The reality of it is we\u2019ve got capacity coming on stream. We\u2019ve also got capacity that isn\u2019t running well and that in the foreseeable future probably won\u2019t be able to run well. And so - and Paul if you assume at some point it\u2019s a zero-sum game, there\u2019s going to be a lot of capacity that shouldn\u2019t run. Certainly - and I have a post-IMO world it\u2019s going to have an effect on that. And so if you got poorly performing assets today, turning them around is a lengthy process. And then if you\u2019ve got a marginal asset due to economics, you\u2019re going to be the guy that has to bow at some point in time. So that\u2019s why we look at it. I mean frankly our tendency is to focus a whole lot more on our business and what we can do to make it better and more efficient than kind of what\u2019s happening more broadly. Paul Sankey : Yes, got it. If I could just ask a very specific follow-up. If we assume that there was extreme weakness in jet fuel demand what would that mean for you and the global industry? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Lane Riggs : Okay. Thanks. Chris [ph] our jet yield is about 8%. So we make 200,000, 250,000 barrels a day of jet. Some of that is contract demand and inland demand which is going to stay but a lot of it in our Gulf Coast refineries we have the ability to put that into diesel, if jet demand got soft and I suspect that\u2019s what would happen. Paul Sankey : Thank you. Lane Riggs : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Sam Margolin : Hello, how are you? Joseph Gorder : Very good, Sam. Sam Margolin : I know you just said you focus on your own business and not the market but I have a market question to start. Joseph Gorder : I didn\u2019t say we don\u2019t focus on the market. Sam Margolin : So a lot of attention is being paid to this collapse in diesel cracks. Part of the reason that the drop has been so pronounced just because the peak that it started from was so high. And at the time when we were at that peak, it seemed obvious why but in retrospect IMO is having more of a feedstock effect than a product effect. So do you have any updated thoughts about that period just three months ago when diesel cracks were peaking in retrospect. What was really driving that? And maybe that will help inform how we can escape this headwind in the intermediate term? Joseph Gorder : Yes, Sam. So I think as we got to the back half of the fourth quarter, obviously fall turnaround season winded down and we started to see refinery utilization ramp up and with higher refinery utilization of course distillate production increased. And then overall, demand has been weaker than what we anticipated. So a lot of that\u2019s been due to warmer weather. The warmer weather is somewhat offset, a lot of the demand increase we thought we would get as a result of IMO. In addition to that, certainly in the U.S. Gulf Coast we\u2019ve had a very heavy fog, which has limited our ability to export the diesel to some of the export markets. In addition to that we\u2019ve had very high freight rates, which again hinder our ability to export. Of course, South America is a big export market for us. They\u2019ve had a lot of rain in South America, which has delayed the harvest. So again having a hit to demand. And then I think the final thing is there was a lot of pre stocking of very low sulfur fuel oil that happened in the industry. And so, so far it\u2019s muted the impact that IMO will have. We certainly are confident that that demand will show up but it would be more of a second quarter type demand increase than what we\u2019re seeing so far in the first quarter. Sam Margolin : Okay. Thanks. And my follow-ups on renewable diesel. It\u2019s been said on this call already the economics are really strong it scales very accretively. On the feedstock side, are there any constraints as you imagine this business getting bigger? There was another operator in the business who recently pivoted a little bit on the feedstock side and said tightening was possible in the future. Do you see any of that? Or is your \u2013 does the strength of your partnership with Diamond kind of help you avoid that friction? Joseph Gorder : Well definitely the strength of our partnership with Diamond helps us. They processed 10% of the world\u2019s meat byproducts. So we\u2019re in a unique position with the JV we have. Feedstock is tied to GDP growth per capita and that\u2019s growing in the world. So it\u2019s going to tighten up some but we still feel good about being able to source it and we don\u2019t see that as a constraint with what we\u2019ve talked about so far. Sam Margolin : All right. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Hi. Good morning, guys. Joseph Gorder : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : I think that the first one is probably either for Lane or Gary. You guys historically won the M-100; I suppose that directly for the crude unit. Have you tested or whether that you will be - have the configuration to one - the high sulfur directly through the quarter. And that if you do that - how big is that capacity you may be able to do here? And also whether you have export any low in the fourth quarter? Lane Riggs : Hey Paul this is Lane. I\u2019ll start and Gary can round me up. As you alluded to, we have a history running in 100, but not all in 100 are created equal. There\u2019s varying quality. We had a - what we would consider to be a quality window that we\u2019ve historically ran. We\u2019ve widened out. We do run -- we run those types of long resid. They obviously have a little bit of cutter stock and we typically run them in our crude supply. And so as we raise the percentages of them, you think about well, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re running to fill to the resid and obviously it makes buildout the bottom of the refiner. And then we\u2019re running fleet crude as a supplement to that, because that\u2019s been an advantaged crude really for the past year. So, it\u2019s really over time we were optimizing by looking at all the domestic light with these resids opening the call the operating envelope for all the resids that we can find in the world. And then we are constantly optimizing that versus the heavy sour crude availability. And that\u2019s kind of how we always run. We\u2019ve just -- we\u2019ve worked really hard to characterize some of these that are new to the market and are trying to run more of them. So, what was your second question? Paul Cheng : No, I mean the first one have you export any no sulfur resid? Lane Riggs : Yes. So, our economic signals have been to low sulfur out of the cat crackers. And we did sell quite a bit of it in the fourth quarter and so far in the first quarter we\u2019re seeing the same economic signals Joseph Gorder : In addition to that we\u2019re - so Paul in addition to that we\u2019re also exporting a lot of low sulfur ATV that we normally run in our as well. Paul Cheng : What kind of economic and how much you have export? I mean is that part of the reason why your margin has been perhaps the better than people thought? Joseph Gorder : Yes. I mean we were selling those particularly low sulfur ATVs and some of the other hydro process resid quite a bit above obviously quite a bit above what they historically been worth? Paul Cheng : Yes. And is there a volume that you can share? Is it say 50,000 barrel per day 100,000 barrel per day, any kind of rough number? Joseph Gorder : No, we probably don\u2019t really want to share that. Paul Cheng : Okay. Final one you run 180,000 barrel per day of the WCS. Is there any more room that you would be able to expand that? Joseph Gorder : Yes there is. So, we have -- we primarily run the Canadian at Port Arthur in Texas City. We can also take it to St. Charles and we have plenty of capacity to run more Canadian. Paul Cheng : How about supply? Can you get it there? Joseph Gorder : Yes, we can. So, today a lot of the problem is certainly pipelines coming out of Western Canada are full but we buy out the pipeline and we also continue to take volume by rail. So I think in the fourth quarter we did a little below 38000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian by rail. We\u2019re seeing those volumes ramp up in the first quarter and expect them to ramp up even more in the second quarter. Paul Cheng : Perfect. Thank you. Joseph Gorder : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Good morning and let me add my\u2026 Joseph Gorder : Good morning, Neil. Neil Mehta : Lane and Gary here on the promotions. I guess my first question is we spend a lot more time than we ever have with investors on the issue of sustainability in carbon intensity. And it\u2019s really the side of the ESG. And Joe maybe you could just talk high level how you think about Valero\u2019s framework for talking to investors about ESG and carbon intensity. Do you feel like you\u2019re there where you want to be on carbon targets and disclosure and then I would think the renewable diesel business becomes a big part of the narrative of how you respond to any difference that might emerge around? Joseph Gorder : Yes. No, Neil that\u2019s a really good question. And you are right. We do spend a lot of time on this. And frankly I think Valero\u2019s got a great story. Jason is responsible and John are jointly responsible for our efforts around this. And we made a lot of progress. And I\u2019ll let those two guys speak to this in some detail. Jason Fraser : Yes, this is Jason. Neil I\u2019ll be glad to talk to you a little bit about it. And as you \u2013 the point you made about strategy is of course, correct. Two of our three segments are now renewable. We\u2019re largest renewable diesel producer in the U.S. through DDD second largest producer of ethanol and we continue to look at that area and expand it as we\u2019ve discussed. And we\u2019re also looking at other low carbon fuels and ways to lower our carbon intense our existing business. So it has a business footprint. I think we\u2019ve been evolving to as the market expectations have changed. I think you\u2019ve done a job on that side. On the environment side, we\u2019re very mindful about environmental impact. We\u2019ve always been proud of our record. In 2019 we had our best ever performance on our environmental scorecard events is the lowest number we\u2019ve ever had and it\u2019s safety has always been a big focus of ours. In 2019, our refining employee NGL rate was our best ever and the combined employee contractor rate was our second lowest in company history. We think we have a good governance structure. 10 of our 11 directors are independent. We have substantial diversity is something we\u2019re always working on. We have really good risk oversight, risk management within our governance structure. And then on the disclosure area which is one of the things you asked about, we\u2019ve definitely beefed it up here in the last couple of years as we put more focus on the ESG area. In September 2018, we published our report on climate-related risks and opportunities. And we prepared that in alignment with the TCFD recommendations which seems to be more and more \u2013 our investors seem to be a coalescent around that as being the standard they want. There are a lot of competing regimes out there. So just good to see some standardization kind of come into play. And they were also putting out a stewardship and responsibility report annually where we talk about some about the carbon stuff but also about other sustainability-oriented areas and we\u2019re continuing to work on that every year to try to make us better. And I know there\u2019s been some large investors focusing on SaaS year as being maybe the standard. And once again outside of carbon there\u2019s been a lot of variability in different disclosure structures and what people may want. So we\u2019re taking a hard look at SaaS this year and comparing to what we\u2019re doing to see if we need to tweak some things there are always looking to improve. Neil Mehta : Right. Appreciate it. And then the follow-up question actually relates to RINs, which I know is collectively our least favorite topic. But there were some headlines recently around the court cases around RINs exemptions and a small waiver, the waivers for some of the smaller refiners from a couple of years ago. Do you see any risk that this becomes an issue that could put upward price pressure on RINs again? Joseph Gorder : Go ahead. Jason Fraser : Okay. Yeah this is Jason again. We did see that in out of case of the Denver last week. And what it did was vacated SREs for three refineries, two of all the frontiers and one of CVRs. And the EPA has several options, including appeal, expect they will probably will appeal, like neither appeal and have the Tenth Circuit that - hear the case as a whole or go straight to the Supreme Court and we know they\u2019re evaluating their options to see. So court took a reading of the statute a fairly constrained view that as far as I know has been done by court in the past but it\u2019s definitely not in keeping with the view the judge had at the way they\u2019ve interpreted the statute in the past. So we really have to see what the judge does with it to get an idea of how impactful this is. One important point is because it was at the circuit of the DC circuit, which is a decision the clients made and when they filed it, it\u2019s only has legal effect within the circuit. So it only binds the EPA within those six states that are covered by the DC circuit. So let\u2019s see how it evolves. Joseph Gorder : Yeah, we\u2019ll see how it plays out. It\u2019s probably too early to give a market signal on RINs prices as a result of this case really. Neil Mehta : Great, guys. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. Your line is now open. Theresa Chen : Good morning. Joe, I\u2019d like to touch on your comments earlier about Permian pipes to Gulf Coast and narrowing of inland. And as far as developments at Corpus Christi goes there\u2019s been continued discussion on potential stock constraints in the area. And based on one of your competitors\u2019 releases yesterday it seems that one of the bigger dock projects that may be delayed a bit. What is your current outlook on the possibility that we might have a lot accrued at Corpus, which I\u2019m sure would benefit your facilities there. And if there are indeed dock constraints would this affect MEH first since there\u2019s no public corporate price and then effect inland really get backed up? Or how should we think about that? Joseph Gorder : Yes, Theresa that\u2019s a good question. Gary is close to this. Let\u2019s let him talk about it for a minute. Gary Simmons : Yeah. So we\u2019re -- when we look at this, it looks like that there will be plenty of dock capacity available but there are some periods of time where it could get very tight. And so our focus really has been to make sure that we\u2019re connected to all of these lines coming out of the Permian and we can take barrels to Corpus or Three Rivers. And then we\u2019ve also put effort into expanding our dock capacity from our Corpus Christi refinery. So part of that project is completed. By early second quarter we\u2019ll have that project 100% completed and essentially double our export capacity that we\u2019ll be able to put through our system. The second part of your question, yes, I would expect it to really affect the MEH posting first. And then, yes, it will probably work its way back into the Permian as time goes on. Theresa Chen : Got it. And switching gears a bit. So the natural gas pricing outlook seems pretty depressed, can you talk about how much of a tailwind this could be for your business this year? Lane Riggs : Well, this is Lane. So that\u2019s -- obviously energy is a big part of the cost structure in our business. And it\u2019s been depressed for a while. So it\u2019s -- obviously it works not only to our advantage, but really the industry\u2019s advantage to compete in the world. I mean natural gas as how we run these refineries largely. And it\u2019s a big advantage for U.S. refining in general. Joseph Gorder : Yeah. Really all industrial activity. Theresa Chen : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Benny Wong : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, I just kind of want to follow-up on Paul\u2019s question around the Canadian barrels. There\u2019s more talk of north about building units, just wanted to get your perspective on that, if that\u2019s kind of a viable path for more Canadian barrels to reach the U.S. Gulf Coast. And just curious have you kind of tested any of these unblended bitumen or facilities? And if they\u2019re really the more desirable type of feedstock that\u2019s what\u2019s been totaled at? Gary Simmons : Yes, so this is Gary. And yes we took bitumen directly from Western Canada and ran it at our refinery at St. Charles and have ongoing discussions with several producers. You can get move a lot more by rail, if you take the undiluted barrel and it would fit well into our system and we have plenty of capacity to be able to run it. Benny Wong : Thanks Gary. Appreciate that. And my follow-up is more on the RFS program and maybe Jason can chime in on this is. There seems to be more focused in D.C. about what that program will look like after it sunsets in 2020? And it seems like the start of setting a higher octane gasoline standard is alive again. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that? And if there is really a path for at this time or and I guess if you think about that program beyond 2022? Thanks. Jason Fraser : Sure. Yes. And this is Jason. And you\u2019re right the tables that set the volumes expire in 2020. The program falls back into the hands of the EPA to set the volumes using certain standards as it got and it\u2019s still open. They hadn\u2019t signaled a lot about what they\u2019re going to do, but we would like to octane fuels to be part of the solution. We think that\u2019s a great answer. It\u2019s great for the all those maybe for taxpayers, it\u2019s great for us. It keeps internal combustion engine more viable in this lower carbon world and more evolving competitor. And its great for ethanol guys because they\u2019re a good choice of low-cost octane. So really it\u2019s a win/win/win solution that we would like to see the attraction. And we definitely are talking it up. We think it\u2019s a great solution for the country. Benny Wong : Great. Thanks, guys. Joseph Gorder : Thanks, Benny. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Joseph Gorder : Good morning. Roger Read : Lot of the good stuff already been hit here, but maybe just to dig in a little bit more on sort of the North American performance versus the global performance. And you\u2019ve mentioned some benefits from NAPA, some benefits from natural gas and from butane. There were also in the last couple of months issues with tanker rates and things like that. So as those events, let\u2019s call it normalized or in this business where everybody takes advantage of them pretty quickly. We are \u2013 the way goes advantages. What looks more sustainable for you here in the next few months versus what looks transitory not just worried so much our thinking hey, we\u2019re going to go to grade gasoline which has its own benefits just curious there, what you\u2019re seeing? Joseph Gorder : Yes I think overall as long as the U.S. production is having to clear to the export markets, despite where freight rates go. We\u2019ll see good advantage running domestic light sweet crude at many of our assets. We also see that running the heavy sour and the high sulfur fuel blend stocks into our high complexity assets looks to be very favorable for the foreseeable future, as well as a result of the IMO bunker spec change. Outside of that, I don\u2019t know what else I would add. Lane Riggs : Roger, I want to add one line. I\u2019ll just add one thing. I think what you\u2019re really seeing is as we alluded to; we\u2019re marketing for low sulfur VGO and low sulfur ATV into the low sulfur fuel oil market. And then what that does is that really is constructed for SEC - for gasoline because SEC are going to be cut. I mean, we\u2019ve sort of talked about it over the past really for the last two years when we were talking about IMO and that part of it is certainly playing out. I mean you\u2019ll see as the gasoline season rolls in, you\u2019ll get a - essentially that market is going to have to compete for feed that\u2019s into the gasoline market. So, it should be supportive of both really sort of both gasoline and diesel. Roger Read : Okay. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe back to Teresa\u2019s question about natural gas. Obviously, cash OpEx guidance of over 4% is kind of higher than what we\u2019ve seen over the last few years. And I know there\u2019s been some changes in the consolidation of VLP and all that. But I was just curious is that something that can be a help on the OpEx side that we should see? Or are there other things moving around here going to keep OpEx on the upper end? Lane Riggs : So, hey Roger, if you - this is Lane again. So, if you compare our guidance to basically first quarter 2020 to first quarter 2019 is pretty much flat. That\u2019s sort of our large turnaround timeframe. And so I would just sort of say that\u2019s flat year-over-year. But when you look at the longer term, certainly, we\u2019ve had realignment reporting structures. We moved the renewable in the Diamond Green Diesel out and we\u2019ve taken all the MLP stuff which would have been in our sort of cost of goods and it came into our OpEx. And so as we realigned all that stuff it sort of resulted in a little bit in terms of our OpEx a little bit higher. And then overall there are - obviously there\u2019s some inflationary pressures in the world. When you - again, when you compare our overall cash OpEx performance on sort of what we would call a basis we are by far in the first quarter, so which means we are the pacesetters in the industry when it comes to cost. Roger Read : That\u2019s pretty well answers. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC. Your line is now open. Brad Heffern : Hi, everyone. A question maybe for Lane on throughput. So this quarter there was almost 1.7 million barrels a day of suite. I think you guys have quoted that capacity historically is more like 1.6%. So, is there something that\u2019s changed? Is that something that running the resid is allowing you to do? And then how should we think about that going forward with some of the dips like Maya widening out? Joseph Gorder : So, what you\u2019re I kind of touched on it a little bit earlier as we\u2019re running more and more the resid doesn\u2019t really have that much lighting components. So, as it substitutes and sort of move up either heavy or really - the real thing that we\u2019re backing out if you look at year-over-year medium sour. So, what\u2019s happening is we\u2019re running more and more light sweet which -- what that\u2019s doing is sort of it\u2019s substituting for medium which does have some into it. So, that\u2019s a journey we\u2019re on. We\u2019ve been signaling max light fleet crude and max heavy and we optimize between heavy sour crudes and resid. And so we\u2019ll -- and I don\u2019t know that we can go a whole lot higher, but we\u2019ll just see quarter-to-quarter and see how much higher we can go. Brad Heffern : Okay. Thanks for that. And then Joe in your prepared comments, you were talking about sort of different things competing for capital and you mentioned M&A as you have in the past. I know you haven\u2019t done a whole bunch recently. You\u2019ve done some ethanol deals or is the terminals acquisition. I guess can you just put any meat on that in terms of what you would potentially be interested in on the M&A front? Joseph Gorder : Yes, why don\u2019t we let Rich talk about that? Rich Lashway : Sure. This is Rich. Hey, Brad. So yeah we continue to look at the opportunities as they arrive. As they arise, a lot of this stuff tends to be in niche markets. And we\u2019re focused on the Gulf Coast and just haven\u2019t seen a lot of things arise there. That\u2019s where we would capture the synergies and where we would have the advantage. So I mean, we look at everything as it comes up, but we don\u2019t see any opportunities that compete against the pipeline of organic projects that we have. Brad Heffern : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Your line is now open. Jason Gabelman : Yeah. Hey guys, morning. I\u2019d like to ask a question about the ethanol and renewable diesel segment. It looks like the indicators have fallen quite a bit from 4Q to year-to-date. And I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s going on in those two markets? And how you see that evolving throughout the course of the year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Martin Parrish : Okay. This is Martin. On the renewable diesel, the indicator drops because the -- you have the blenders tax credit in place now. So we gave up a little bit on the RIN, feedstock costs got a little higher, but you need to add $1 a gallon to that indicator to get really where market is. So again we\u2019re 126 pro forma, but that\u2019s really a $2.26 EBITDA per gallon, so that one is not concerning at all. Fourth quarter ethanol was what $0.14 a gallon, EBITDA was our performance that\u2019s come in and you\u2019re correct there. January is always tough in the business. I mean, domestic gasoline demand is low, ethanol inventories always build in January. Really what\u2019s happened in the ethanol space we\u2019ve been oversupplied in the U.S. for several years. Exports were growing at 30% CAGR up through 2018. 2019 they took a breather and that was really due to low sugar prices in the world. So Brazil made more ethanol. Right now though sugar prices are up 20% versus where they averaged 2019, export demand is strong. We\u2019re seeing really good numbers in December, January, February and March. So we still - ethanol is in the fuel mix to stay in the U.S. little bit of incremental E15, and then hopefully this higher octane standard would really help the industry obviously. So we\u2019re still optimistic about the future. Jason Gabelman : Thanks. I appreciate those thoughts. And then if I could just go back to running resid high sulfur fuel oil. Can you just put some numbers around or discuss how much of that -- those intermediates you\u2019re running and backing out crude as a result? And how much of that is incremental feedstock? And in addition to that, are there any type of indicative economics that you could give on running those barrels. I understand there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but are we talking low single-digit dollar per barrel, high single-digit dollar per barrel in the double digit range? Just to give us a sense of what the uptake is? Thanks. Lane Riggs : Hi. So this is Lane. We\u2019re not going to share our detailed volumes in terms of how we do all that. And obviously the relative margins are all a function of what the market is. They\u2019re not fixed off one another. There is a dynamic market out there, that\u2019s a function of the crude market, the high sulfur fuel oil market, the low sulfur fuel market, the latter two of which are still trying to sort themselves out with respect to IMO 2020. So these things vary just like any other feedstock that we run. There\u2019s not a guaranteed margin relative to one another. And as all the refining capacity looks at all this and optimizes then if they -- the margins are going to be different over time. So, there\u2019s nothing that -- there\u2019s not anything we can communicate that you can hang your hat on per se. Jason Gabelman : Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, and Holt. Your line is now open. Matthew Blair : I wanted to check in on asphalt and pet coke. I know it\u2019s only about 3% of your product slate, but how has pricing and realizations fared on these areas just given all the volatility on high sulfur fuel oil in the recent weakness? Gary Simmons : Yes. So this is Gary. I think overall we\u2019ve been surprised that asphalt margins have stayed relatively strong. We thought that there may be an attempt to push a lot of these high sulfur resid into the asphalt market, you would see weakness. But thus far, asphalt margins in our system have remained strong. And I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen much of an impact at all on pet coke. Matthew Blair : Sounds good. And then the sales volumes in renewable diesel were quite strong in the fourth quarter. Just wanted to confirm was that a result of selling down some inventory or did the plant to actually run at those levels? Gary Simmons : We ran at those levels. Matthew Blair : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Chris Sighinolfi : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on Neil\u2019s earlier sustainability question if I could. And I just have two questions. I guess first Joe have you looked at CCUS investment to capture incremental carbon off facilities? I know some of your integrated peers are working on that specifically on ethanol facilities to using some of their EOR operations. So, I\u2019m just wondering if it\u2019s something you looked at and what the opportunity set might be? Joseph Gorder : We are looking at it. Yes. And Martin and Rich are they got a team put together and we\u2019re kind of down the road on this. I think -- I guess the real question that we\u2019re trying to you always wonder about what\u2019s the cost of care are going to be what the economics is going to look like on an investment in a project like this. So, we are looking at it though. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. And then I guess second in light of the BTC extension [indiscernible] has clearly become more valuable as noted it\u2019s a key pillar in your environmental sustainability story which is clearly set apart from your refining peers. But Joe I\u2019m just curious do you think you get appropriate credit for that and the ethanol franchise within Valero? And I guess what are any thoughts or internal evaluation about if or when those businesses might make more sense being independent? Joseph Gorder : Yes. Well, those are two very different questions. One is do we think it matters from an ES&G perspective and I think it definitely does. We have a very clear view of what -- where things are going and what the world is demanding now. And we really believe renewable fuel is a key component of that. And the good news is that they both happen to be great businesses and we\u2019ve got great assets and good teams. So, I think as time goes on, people will see that Valero somewhat differentiated perhaps from others out there because of these investments. As far as separating them off, my view is they are producers of motor fuels and different types of motor fuels, very low carbon intensity motor fuels, but they\u2019re motor fuels and Valero produces motor fuels. That\u2019s what our business is and we do it really well. And these are largely process operations and they integrate well, processes that we\u2019ve implemented on the refining side are scalable to our ethanol plants and to the renewable diesel operations. And so I think frankly being embedded in the company, it brings more value to Valero that it would just split it out. Chris Sighinolfi : That\u2019s perfect. Thanks a lot for the time. Appreciate it. Joseph Gorder : You bet. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Homer Bhullar for closing remarks. Homer Bhullar : Great. Thank you. We appreciate everyone joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.+",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Homer Bhullar, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the Company's or Management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe, for opening remarks. Joseph Gorder : Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. Well, we've all had a very challenging start to the year with significant impact to our families, communities, and businesses worldwide, brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ensuing collapse of economic activity due to stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions has driven down demand for our products, particularly gasoline and jet fuel. Despite these extraordinary challenges, we're blessed to be able to continue supporting our community partners and organizations on the frontlines that help people most in need in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Across the country, we see neighbors and strangers helping one another and demonstrating genuine human kindness. With that in mind, our ethanol operations produced hand sanitizer for distribution to hospitals, emergency responders and other organizations, and I'm proud of our employees for their innovation and efforts to make this possible. Valero entered this economic downturn in a position of strength and our team has been thorough, decisive, and swift in our operational and financial response to the current environment. Operationally, we've adjusted the throughput rates at our refineries to more closely match product supply with demand, to ensure that our supply chain does not become physically infeasible. We also temporarily idled a number of our ethanol plants and reduced the amount of corn feedstock processed at the remaining plants, to address the decreased demand for ethanol. Financially, we remain well capitalized. We started the year with a solid cash balance. Due to the uncertainty in the markets and attractive rates available to us, we thought it'd be prudent to strengthen our financial position further. We entered into a new $875 million revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn, and we raised $1.5 billion of debt for additional liquidity. We also temporarily suspended buybacks in mid-March. In addition, we decided to defer approximately $100 million in tax payments that were due in the first quarter, along with approximately $400 million in capital projects for the year, including slowing the Port Arthur Coker and Pembroke Cogen projects, which pushes out their mechanical completion by 6 to 9-months. That being said, we continue to make progress on several of our strategic projects. We completed the Pasadena terminal project, which expands our products logistics portfolio, increases our capacity for biofuels blending, and enhances flexibility for export. And the St. Charles Alkylation Unit remains on-track to be completed in 2020. And we're continuing to make progress on the Diamond Pipeline expansion and the Diamond Green Diesel project, both of which should be completed in 2021, subject to COVID-19 related delays. The Diamond Green Diesel joint venture also continues to make progress on the advanced engineering review of a potential new renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur, Texas facility.  So, the actions we've taken are consistent with the capital allocation framework we've had in place for several years. We continue to prioritize our investment grade credit rating and non-discretionary uses of capital, including sustaining capital expenditures and our dividend. And you should continue to expect incremental discretionary cash flow to compete with other discretionary uses, primarily organic growth capital and buybacks. Our framework has served as well and we'll continue to adhere to it in the future. In closing, the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and the communities where we operate remain among our top priorities. Our prudent management of operations has allowed us to weather a global shutdown like this without lay-offs. And while a tremendous amount of uncertainty remains in the near future, our operational and financial flexibility allow us to navigate through today's challenging macro environment. Our advantaged footprint with the flexibility to process a wide range of feedstocks, coupled with a relentless focus on operational excellence and a demonstrated commitment to stockholders, positions our assets well as our country and the world return to a more normal way of life. So, with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you Homer Bhullar : Thanks Joe. For the first quarter of 2020, the net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.9 billion or $4.54 per share, compared to net income of $141 million or $0.34 per share for the first quarter of 2019. First quarter 2020 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $140 million or $0.34 per share, compared to $181 million or $0.43 per share for the first quarter of 2019. First quarter 2020 adjusted results exclude an after-tax lower of cost or market, or LCM, inventory valuation adjustment of approximately $2 billion. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany this release. The Refining segment generated an operating loss of $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the $479 million of operating income for the first quarter of 2019. First quarter 2020 adjusted operating income for the refining segment, which excludes the LCM inventory valuation adjustment was $329 million. First quarter 2020 results were impacted by low product margins related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid decline in crude prices. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which was in line with the first quarter of 2019. Throughput capacity utilization was 90% in the first quarter of 2020. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.87 per barrel were $0.28 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower natural gas prices. Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was $198 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $49 million for the first quarter of 2019. After adjusting for the retroactive blender's tax credit, adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $121 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales volumes. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 867,000 gallons per day in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 77,000 gallons per day versus the first quarter of 2019. The Ethanol segment generated an operating loss of $197 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $3 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2019. The first quarter of 2020 adjusted operating loss, which excludes the LCM inventory valuation adjustment was $69 million. The decrease from the first quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower margins resulting from lower ethanol prices and higher corn prices. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.1 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2020. For the first quarter of 2020, general and administrative expenses were $177 million and net interest expense was $125 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $582 million and the income tax benefit was $616 million in the first quarter of 2020. The effective tax rate was 26%, which was impacted by an expected U.S. federal tax net operating loss that can be carried back to years prior to December 2017 enactment of tax reform in the U.S. Net cash used in operating activities was $49 million in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the unfavorable impact from the change in working capital of $1.1 billion, as well as our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in its working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $954 million. With regard to investing activities, we made $705 million of capital investments in the first quarter of 2020, of which approximately $468 million was for sustaining the business, including cost for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance. Approximately $237 million of the total was for growing the business. Excluding our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's capital investments, Valero's capital investments were approximately $666 million. Moving to financing activities, we returned $548 million to our stockholders in the first quarter of 2020. $401 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 2.1 million shares of Valero common stock. The total pay-out ratio was 57% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. As of March 31, we had approximately $1.4 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. And last week, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share, further demonstrating our sound financial position and commitment to return cash to our investors. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter-end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $11.5 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio net of cash and cash equivalents was 34%. In April, we closed on a 364-day, $875 million revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. Including this credit facility, we had over $5 billion of available borrowing capacity. Turning to guidance, we now expect annual capital investments for 2020 to be approximately $2.1 billion, reflecting a reduction of $400 million from our prior guidance. The $2.1 billion includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts, and joint venture investments. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.325 million to 1.375 million barrels per day. U.S. mid-continent at 315,000 to 335,000 barrels per day. U.S. West Coast at 215,000 to 235,000 barrels per day, and North Atlantic at 315,000 to 335,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $4.50 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 2 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.49 per gallon, which includes $0.12 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2020. Operating expenses in 2020 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.20 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the second quarter, net interest expense should be about $145 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $580 million. For 2020, we expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $825 million, and we still expect the RIN's expense for the year to be between $300 million and $400 million. Lastly, due to the impact of beneficial tax provisions in the CARES Act, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, small changes and assumptions yield a wide range of outcomes, resulting in a low degree of confidence in any estimate of the effective tax rate. So, at this point, we're not providing any guidance on it. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please re-join the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Doug Terreson : So, global refined product supplies following - in response to the declines that were in demand that we're seeing with more competitive plants probably reducing output less than others. On this point, I wanted to get your insights on Atlantic Basin and global storage levels, whether you think we're nearing capacity? And if so, when might we get there? So, just some fundamental color on these market areas if you have it. And then second, because refiners are completely shut down, often face challenges when they restart, if they restart. I want to see if you'd kind of frame the pros and cons for us of those decisions and also whether the new fuel specs might affect restarts in the current scenario? So, the questions are on market fundamentals and potential capacity outcomes. Gary Simmons : Okay. Doug, this is Gary. Your question on market fundamentals and North Atlantic Basin, we were staring at that pretty hard a few weeks ago and thought we were going to have an issue with that region filling up with products. But really been encouraged by the reaction of the industry to cut rates and to make less gasoline and diesel. [Technical difficulty] API yesterday showed that Pad 1 had a small draw on gasoline, which is encouraging. But at this stage, it looks like the industry has done a good job to balance supply with demand and we're not as concerned about filling up on inventory. Doug Terreson : Okay, good. Lane Riggs : Doug this is Lane. I'll answer the second question. So, you're exactly right, whenever there's the risk of - everybody I'm sure, most refiners try to push their refinery utilization down somewhere near minimum, which normally is 50% to 65% for a given unit. But because of the risk of shutting one down very much puts you at risk of when you try to start back up it's not going to start up and you have to go into a full-blown turnaround. Now with that said, we actually did shut down our St. Charles FCC. It's a big FCC. And it was because we had just finished a turnaround. But we saw that as being a way to take off some gasoline producing capacity for our system and not take that risk. In terms of fuel quality, it's just - there's a lot of investment out there in terms of lower sulfur. It just depends on, if for some reason a GDU or a ULSD unit have a problem on startup. But other than that, I - as I think about that for us, I haven't seen that to be a big problem for us. Operator : Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : First question, just on the depth and duration of the demand shock. Gasoline margin seems to be responding to the industry lowering utilizations and margins have improved, but the diesel side has seen some volatility recently. Not sure if it's just reflecting real economic contraction on an activity. Can you just talk about what's happening there on the diesel side? Gary Simmons : Yes, Theresa, this is Gary. So, I think that as we talked about, the industry did a good job of balancing supply and demand on the gasoline side. For the most part, along with that, we were cutting refinery crude runs with the expectation that would bring diesel balances pretty close to supply being in balance with demand. However, the jet demand disruption was just so severe, and everyone started blending jet into diesel, it caused the diesel yield from refineries to be really at record levels. And even despite the lower refinery utilization, we've seen diesel production outpacing demand, causing the inventory build. I think we are seeing, at least this week, starting to see some indications in the market that people in the industry including ourselves are making some adjustments to their operations to bring the diesel yields down which should be supportive to the diesel fundamentals moving forward. Theresa Chen : And in terms of the recent force majeure declarations, whether it be Flint Hills, your refining neighbor in Corpus or Continental as a producer or Pemex declaring force majeure on gasoline imports, do you see an acceleration of this? Do you think the reasoning would likely hold up in the court? And can you just talk about how you see these developments evolving as both an entity that can declare force majeure or as a counterparty on which force majeure could be declared against? Joseph Gorder : Yes. So, Theresa, we're trying - okay - are you asking kind of a legal perspective on force majeure? Or you're asking kind of do we expect the market to continue to do this? Theresa Chen : The latter more. Joseph Gorder : Okay. So, Gary, you want to? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, I can tell you most of our - certainly on the crude side of the business, most of our contracts have a 30-day cancellation. And we've been trying to tell our suppliers we expect to hold them to that. And so, so far we haven't really seen much of a disruption in crude supply as a result of the force majeure you're reading about in the press. Operator : Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Manav Gupta : Joe, at the start of the call you mentioned weaker gasoline demand. What I'm trying to understand is, Texas is lifting the order on Friday. Florida has minimum number of cases. So, those two are big demand states and looks like their orders will be lifted, at least a partial reopen by end of this week. And then there are about 16 states that have come behind them with their prospective reopen plan. So, what I'm trying to understand is, yes, gasoline demand is bad right now, but as one after another of these states do start opening, like when do we start seeing a rebound in the gasoline demand as these states do start coming online? Joseph Gorder : It's a good question. Let me give you an anecdotal answer and then Gary can give you what we're seeing in the system, he and Lane. But I mean in San Antonio Proper, we have - because I'm serving on some committees that are working on some issues here. But we've seen 14% increase in traffic over the last couple of weeks. So, people are starting to get out more. And as you said, we're going to be opening up and I think there probably is a pent-up demand for folks to get out of their houses and get mobile and to shop again and to go to restaurants again. So, I do think we're going to see more activity, and not only here but much more broadly, particularly through the South. Gary, within the system, we've also seen some change in demands? Gary Simmons : Yes, we have. So, we saw a very sharp follow up in demand, really the last two weeks in March. Kind of got to a point in our system where we were seeing demand about 55% of what we would call normal. For the first couple of weeks in April, it seemed to stabilize around that level. But now we're starting to see demand pick back up already. So, if you look at the seven-day average in our rack systems, it's about 64% of normal. So, already about a 9% increase of where we were kind of early April. And as you mentioned, where you're really seeing the pickup is in the Mid-Continent, the Gulf Coast regions, as some of these stay-at-home orders are lifted. We're seeing a fairly significant sharp increase in demand. Manav Gupta : Thanks guys. A quick follow up. Your benchmark indicated on the renewable diesel side was almost down $0.45, but the realized margin actually was up quarter-over-quarter. I'm trying to understand how did you so successfully managed to beat your own benchmark and deliver a beat on the renewable diesel side? Martin Parrish : Manav, this is Martin. On the benchmark, you have to realize we're using a soybean oil price. Our actual feedstock costs are going to differ from that. There's other impacts too, contractually what we're doing this year versus last year. So, I'm not going to give you a hard and fast answer on that, but it's - we just - you're kind of seeing the strength of renewable diesel and the strength of Diamond Green there. Operator : Our next question will be from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read : Well, tons of stuff to ask here, but I guess where I'd like to go first question really, what are you seeing in terms the crude side of the market? How has that been flowing through in terms of, we had negative crude prices for a day, availability of different lights and heavies and maybe how that's flowing through? Maybe some guidance on what capture can be in such a uncertain market condition? Gary Simmons : Roger, a lot of volatility in the crude markets and we've certainly been changing our purchase signals from week-to-week, kind of moving throughout the quarter. I think for quite some time now, we've been signaling really maximum light sweet along with heavy sour and we haven't seen the economics of the medium sour as much. We got into March and medium sours became economic and we ramped up medium sours. However, that, I would say we've kind of returned back to the place where we were before, where we're back kind of maximizing light sweets and heavy sours in our system. And certainly, in some regions, you're seeing real wide market dislocations on some of the light sweets that we're buying, especially in the Mid-Continent region, Line 9 through Quebec's providing us with a big benefit, and then we're balancing those light sweet purchases with a lot of different heavy sour feedstock. So, kind of step back into some of the high sulfur fuel blend stocks along with some heavy sour crudes that we're sourcing from Canada and South America. Roger Read : Yes, I'm going to go out on a limb and say you're not having any trouble finding crudes at this point? Gary Simmons : No, no trouble in that area at all. Roger Read : All right. That's not going to get Joe to laugh. Second question on - Joseph Gorder : You did. Roger Read : Second question on the regulatory side and a couple of parks here. But we're going to have a real issue is hitting any sort of ethanol blending volumes this year. So, where do you stand on, or where do you think the market stands maybe on getting some relief there? And then, I was curious if there's any other regulatory headaches in front of you at this point, stuff we don't normally think about, but whether it's the winter grade to summer grade, exclusions that were given into the May or any other sort of headwinds we should think about on the regulatory side? Joseph Gorder : Okay. Jason, you want to speak to those? Jason Fraser : Yes. Yes, I can definitely talk a little bit about RFS. Of course, with the large drop in gasoline and diesel demand and the harm to our industry, the compliance cost of RFS does stick out a little more and it's definitely not helping things. And rents are still pretty high. They didn't really drop with the price of our products. So, five governors recently sent a letter to the EPA, requesting to exercise the severe economic harm waiver authority, to reduce the RVOs for 2020.We definitely agree with those governors and believe the EPA has the authority and the basis to grant those waivers and lower the volumes. As far as other regulatory headwinds, I can't think of any right now. Joseph Gorder : Nor can I. The other guys can't. So, just say good morning to Tom, Roger. Operator : Our next question will come from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Gresh : Hi. So first question, you had mentioned demand is about 64% of normal and your utilization guide for the quarter looks like it's in the low 70s. Would you say that today you're operating kind of below that midpoint and the expectation with that guidance is that utilization would ramp over the quarter? Or would you say that you intend to kind of have a more stable utilization and if demand gets better, we'll start to see inventory draws? Lane Riggs : Phil, this is Lane. So, if you think about it, the low 70s throughput basis, not all of which goes into gasoline and diesel. We're trying to make sure that we are careful to match our feedstock plans with where we think demand is. Now, pint into that is a flight - some recovery towards the end of it, but our buying habits right now have to be beyond the assumption that crude will be available and that we're going to run our assets to meet demand. And not necessarily let structure drive us to maybe outrun demand or anything like that. Phil Gresh : Okay. And just broadly, how do you think about, if you think about the macro on the gasoline and the diesel side over the next, call it, one to two quarters, how do you think about the inventory progression for the industry based on the way you've been modeling it? Joseph Gorder : Well, Gary, took a shot at that earlier. I guess I can take another shot at it and then Gary can tune whatever I have to say here. I think the industry has done a really good job with respect to gasoline. And we were-- when that first started, that was our primary concern. And I think the industry responded with appropriate rate reductions and including us. And where we are today is, you have, like Gary mentioned, just dropping in diesel. So, how I think that'll play out if there are signals right now out there to essentially drop diesel and the gas oil, which will replace some VGO purchases into these conversion unit. So, you should see some diesel disruption. And then everybody's going to have to stare how much crude they really think they need to meet demand. And so, ultimately it comes back to demand versus how does this crude supply. Obviously, there is a lot of crude. So, you don't have to reach out very long or far in your supply chain. Very committed, then you can ramp up accordingly or cut accordingly, depending on how that plays out. Phil Gresh : Okay, great. And then my follow up is just on CapEx. How much flex do you see in your capital spending as you move into 2021? It sounds like most of the CapEx that you're cutting back on this year, it was more related to growth projects, but just sort of any color as you look out? Thanks. Joseph Gorder : Yes, we would expect, if we needed, it'd be something commensurate with the $400 million that we talked about and gave the guidance for this year. Operator : Our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : It seems like a long time since we had our virtual dinner. So, I hope you guys are all doing well. Joseph Gorder : Boy, sure it has, hasn't it? Thanks, Doug. Doug Leggate : So, two quick questions. First of all, I don't know if Donna is there, but I wanted to ask about working capital, the mechanics of any potential unwind and how you would expect the working capital to - the trajectory through the year? I know it's a bit of a moving piece. And I guess a related question, which is my second question, also financial, on the balance sheet. I know you're at 34% net debt-to-cap. That's probably the highest level you've had in quite a while. Obviously, there's no liquidity issues, but I'm just curious is that where you see the balance sheet headed over the medium-term and how would you move - how did you look to move it back? And I guess what I'm really trying to understand is if and when things normalize. would you tend to run with a more robust balance sheet going forward after this or how would your behavior change as it relates to just treatment of buybacks, balance sheet, dividends, things of that nature? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. Donna Titzman : All right. Well, I'll start with the working capital. Now, you're correct, as we've seen, prices leveled off a bit. And then, hopefully, now, as they start to recover with the economy waking backup, we would expect to see that working capital draw reverse itself. I can't tell you how quickly that will happen. That is really all dependent on how quickly we see these prices recover. And to answer the balance sheet question; obviously, yes, the debt cap has gone up a bit here of late. Our intentions would be, as everything gets back to normal, to also normalize that balance sheet a bit when we raised the $1.5 billion. We did that in short-term maturities and not in 10s and 30s, with the idea that that would become repayable much quicker than a longer-term issuance. So, our intent would be to kind of get back to where we were pre all of this, as quickly as we can. And again, the liquidity, as you mentioned, is absolutely key today. So, we are definitely in the cash preservation mode right now, but we have a very strong liquidity level and are very comfortable with where we're at today. Doug Leggate : Donna, can I just ask for some clarification on the working capital? What - you're on a, I assume, a net payables position. I was really more interested in the mechanics. I understand you've had a big drop in crude prices, so obviously that hurts you. But do you anticipate that - a big move obviously in Q1, but do you anticipate any additional moves in terms of use of working capital after the shock you've had in oil prices or do you think the worst is kind of behind us there? Donna Titzman : Well, I think you can expect that - a lot of this started in mid-March and continued through the April timeframe, so you should probably expect some of that to have carried into April. But as I mentioned, things are leveling off and hopefully now we're looking at improvement from this point forward. So, we shouldn't see that same kind of level of cash being consumed. Operator : Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Hi team, good morning, and hope all of you are doing well. I just want to follow-up on this question of demand that we've talked a lot about on this call, 2020 demand conditions. Joe and team, I want to get your perspective on sort of the structural questions of demand, particularly for two products : gasoline in jet. So, on gasoline, the thoughts around work from home, and does that create a change in social behavior that has an impact on more gas demand? And jet, the willingness of the consumer to travel, I think all of us are just trying to figure out whether there is a long-term impact from some of the changes that we've seen here over the last month, or do you view you this as more cyclical? Gary Simmons : Yes, Neil, this is Gary. So, I think we are taking those things into account. So, where we saw a fairly sharp decline in demand to this 55% level, we would expect the recovery to be more gradual on the demand side, as people continue to work from home. We see some offsetting things. Certainly, people working from home, but then you're going to have people driving more and probably using mass transit less, going forward. It's just because the social distancing is hard when you're on mass transit. So, overall, we see a fairly gradual recovery in demand and gasoline demand getting back close to where it was pre-COVID. On the jet side, I think we believe that the lower jet demand is probably here with us longer and it probably is a late year type recovery, where people are going to get back and start flying again or requires a vaccine or something on the medical side to happen, where people start to feel comfortable flying again. Neil Mehta : That's great. Thank you. The follow-up is just on the dividend. I think the message you're trying to deliver here is that the dividend is a core priority and something that you're committed to. But just want to get your perspective on that and hear how you guys are thinking about the interim dividend? Joseph Gorder : Yes, okay, Neil. I'll take a first crack and then I'll let Donna also have a shot at this. But, you know, with the situation we're dealing with right now, with the pandemic, we consider it to be a fairly short term in nature. And obviously, our team is running the business for the long term. And as the guys have mentioned, we're already seeing improvements in demand, which we think are going to continue as people return to more normal activities. So, let's look at how we manage the business, what we said for several years now and how we're managing it going forward, okay? We've got this capital allocation framework in place that we've adhered to for years. And within that framework, we consider the use of cash for sustaining CapEx and turnarounds, and then the dividends to be non-discretionary. And then the discretionary uses are acquisitions, growth projects and share repurchases. And there's the competition that we have for those dollars within those three categories. So, with that in mind, think about what we've done and the actions that we've taken today, okay? We've reduced our discretionary capital spending and our share buybacks and we're not considering any acquisitions until there's certainly further improvements in the market. So, those three things are playing out the way they should within the context of that capital allocation framework. But if you look at additional actions that has been taken, we have a very capable proactive Board of Directors and they declared the dividend last Friday. And they have the same confidence in our business and this team that I have. So, the things that we've talked about for years are the things that we've implemented and that we use both when margins are really strong and when margins are weak, like they have been here over the last six or eight weeks. And so, in my view, relative to the dividend, we got a long way to go before we need to take any action there. Donna, anything you'd like to add? Donna Titzman : No, I mean, just all along, we have maintained a conservative balance sheet for the purpose of being able to survive times like this. Operator : Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Prashant Rao : My first question is on the balance sheet and specifically on debt. I wanted to sort of touch back on that. You guys took good advantage of the low interest rate environment and the strength of your financial position with that $1.5 billion in recently issued debt. I'm just wondering, depending upon how the recovery here goes economically, are there further opportunities ahead to take advantage of these low interest rates, maybe potentially refi or retire other parts of the current debt structure, lower your overall interest expense? Donna, you made a comment about sort of the appetite for longer tenor versus shorter tenor debt, so perhaps that plays into this as well? So, any color there would be appreciated. Thanks. Donna Titzman : Sure. So, the problem with - this is something that we look at all of the time, not just in this environment but on a regular basis. The issue typically with retiring, refinancing current debt out there is we have make-whole provisions in all of our agreements. So effectively, what we're doing is paying the investor the impact of the current low prices anyway. So, from an economic perspective, that rarely works out to be a good deal. That being said, we continue - but we're always looking for odd moments in the market where things may not trade as efficiently as others, many times those are smaller opportunities and not larger opportunities. But again, we'll continue to look for those ideas, but I wouldn't say that that would happen in a big way. Prashant Rao : Okay. Thank you. That's clear. My follow-up is sort of pre-differential question. We've seen a lot of disparities and some disconnects between what we see on the screen and the physical market, I guess the financial and the physical market. We get some questions on the ability to aid that disparity and what that means for the ability of refiners to capture some of those dislocations and how to - how cautious should we be in thinking about that as we look forward and as we model here? And did some of those pre differential advantages may be preserved into further quarters or months ahead given that legalization rates are low right now? So, wanted to get a sense of those. There's a lot of working parts in there, but get a sense of how some - those of us who aren't operating experts might be able to think about that from a modeling perspective? Gary Simmons : Sure, this is Gary. In kind of a couple ways on the crude side, some of our contracts - some of our supply contracts on the crude side are based on a monthly average price. So obviously, when you have the dislocation that happened at the end of the month, it does figure into the monthly average and will ultimately make its way to our delivered crude costs. And then we also, I can't say that we anticipated the crude going negative like it did, but we certainly saw the potential for weakness as you got the contract expiry. So we did probably go into that period of time a little on the short side to give us the opportunity to go out and buy some of those discounted barrels, and we've done that. And then to your point, if we had room to absorb in our system, we'll run those barrels. If not, there's places where we're putting those barrels into storage and you'll see that benefit in months to come. Operator : Our next question will come from Paul Chen with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Paul Chen : I just want to wish - first want to wish everyone and the team and your family safe and healthy. Joe and Gary, can you talk a bit about the export market? Because I think that they've been holding up reasonably well in the first quarter, but seems like they start to be having some crack. I'm actually quite concerned, because I think Latin America probably have a lot of the infected cases that they probably didn't know yet. So, maybe you can help us understanding what you are seeing? Particularly, in the last two or three weeks, have you seen any trend? Gary Simmons : Paul, this is Gary. So, really our April volumes, we don't have the final accounting volumes done yet, of course. But our April export volumes are down about 10% from what we did in the first quarter or more typical type number. So, you're not really seeing it in April. But in May, with what we're selling forward, you're seeing a far lower demand in the Latin American countries than what we've typically seen kind of support. On the distillate side, you did see a falloff in diesel exports. Some of that has just been because the U.S. inventories were very low. And so, the U.S. market was stronger and we were better to keep the barrels in the domestic markets than to ship them abroad. But on the distillate side, we saw exports following off around 50% of normal, gasoline has been more 10%. Where we're selling wholesale barrels like into Mexico, we've been surprised at how well those volumes have held up. So, yesterday, in Mexico, we moved 85% of what we were moving in the first quarter. So, our wholesale volumes, the barrels that we're selling in-country are holding. But we are seeing the export markets fall off. Paul Chen : Thank you. And Gary, you talked about the gas, the storage is not going to reach the [indiscernible] in the Atlantic Basin. Can you talk about the three or in the inland market? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, that was the other there area that we had a lot of concern on. And again, you could see in the Mid-Continent, refiners adjusted and look like we may fill up in a couple of weeks, and now they've kind of adjusted gasoline balance with the demand, and we're seeing inventory draws. And the Mid-Continent is one of the areas that we've actually seen the best recovery in demand out of all the regions. Paul Chen : Can you talk about California? Because we've seen a sudden improvement in the margin over the last, say, couple of weeks. But is there any particular reason driving that? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, that really is more driven I would say from the production side. I think the refining industry has done a good job of bringing units offline and getting production balance with demand. We've actually seen some inventories draw on Pad 5, and so that's led to the strength in the gasoline market. Operator : Our next question will come from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Benny Wong : I hope everybody on the line is safe and healthy. My first question is really on the planned maintenance. We've seen a lot of facilities defer maintenance work, just given the challenges of COVID. Just looking a little bit further out. When we're back to more of a normal environment, would you expect a little bit of pent-up maintenance activity that needs to be had by then? Or do you think there's enough flexibility for guys to kind of do the work during this period of reduced runs and shutdowns right now? Lane Riggs : So Benny, obviously - this is Lane. I'll just give you our behavior, the proxy for that. We were fortunately in good position. And at the second half of the year, we had a low sort of planned turnaround basis. So, we didn't have a lot of planned turn arounds. And so, when we looked at all of our - so when we look at our turnaround, we look at our maintenance, we're making sure that we maintain our plants just like we do in our framework and very carefully. But we did sort of push some discretionary maintenance into next year, and I'm sure a lot of people are going to do that. At some point, obviously people have to do turnaround. So, people who are deferring turnaround, been doing a lot of that, at some point that does catch up and we'll just have to see. And at some point you have to take a turnaround. And there was a question earlier that I'll answer too. Somebody shut a unit down and there's a long - somewhere near the end of its run cycle, there will be some risk to starting it up, which may force - force them to take the turnaround early. Benny Wong : Got it. Thanks, Lane. That's super helpful. My second question is on the renewable diesel. So, just curious, with this economic shutdown, the impact we've had on demand and even on the feedstock side, and just taking a little further out, any risk that these events might cause some of the jurisdictions that are looking at adopting LCFS to maybe those plans being delayed? Martin Parrish : Okay, this is Martin. I think if you step back and put DGD in perspective, right, we've got a great first quarter in the book. We're running at full capacity and our outlook hasn't changed, as we're committed to the long-term strategy of growing the business. With COVID-19, carbon prices dropped slightly, but the rent has escalated and entirely offset that, and the gallon blenders tax credit dollar per gallons in play. On the feedstock availability, you have to understand we're running 275 million gallons a year now. We have plans to go up to 4x that amount and we still believe we can secure the feedstock for that. So, this is kind of a - there's disruptions, but it's not significant. We're not concerned about keeping feed in front of the unit. As far as what it does for the LCFS, I think all this is rather temporary and I'd characterize it as bump in the road, but I don't think it's going to slow anything down materially. And certainly, in the rearview mirror, I don't think it's going to be that significant. Joseph Gorder : Yes. I don't-- Jason, I don't know what you think, but I don't think anybody's going to back off of LCFS type regulations. Jason Fraser : Yes, I don't think so. You may see a little bit of slow in them actually enacting laws and bills just because they've taken a lot of recesses with the social distancing. So, the legislature in a lot of the states, they've really slowed down last couple months. So, we're starting to see them talk about coming back and get back into session. I think Arizona and California are coming back. We were just talking about it yesterday. But you can see that a little bit of delay in that, but I don't think it changes the long-term trend or their views. Operator : Our next question will come from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brad Heffern : Another question on capture. I think some of the things that have been discussed so far have been around crude discounts and sound like they're positive for capture. I'm just wondering, with these refineries running in these sort of unusual constraints, and load utilization and maybe FCC is being shut down, are there decrements we need to be thinking about to capture as well, either as it relates to how much you can optimize the system or maybe the production of intermediates or something along those lines? Lane Riggs : So - hey, Brad, this is Lane. So, I would just say, with respect to anything, it might be something to think. The conversion units create volume gains, whether they're hydrocracker or FCC. And so to the extent that we're cutting FCC and hydrocrackers to meet the demand, we think there are - you'll have, you could have a negative - your volume gain isn't there to help in your margin capture. I would say outside of that, I don't know if there's anything else with how we're operating to directly impact that. Brad Heffern : Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then maybe one for Martin. Just on the ethanol business, you guys gave the guidance of $2.0 million for this quarter, down a little bit more than 50%. Is there a reason that you're not running it lower than that? Just given that we're seeing negative margins on the screen here, even before OpEx? Thanks. Martin Parrish : Okay, sure. Well, as you know, we've got eight of our plants down and six are running. So, we're actually running lower than 50% today. This demand disruption really hit home in ethanol right, significant cuts have been made across the industry. We cut - if you look at the April EIA information, it would tell that demand is - implied demand is less than 50% of last year. So, we think we're in the right spot. Ultimately, this will recover right and global renewable fuel mandates will drive export growth. Domestically, we'll get going again and ethanol is going to be in the gasoline pool. And we'll see incremental demand as a result of fuel efficiency standards and year-round E15 sales. Operator : Our next question will come from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Sam Margolin : I've got a sort of outlook question. Gary mentioned that your light sweet throughput was up in the quarter, that's probably because crude production was up in the U.S. still in the first quarter. That doesn't look like it's going to continue. I mean, in the environment where U.S. crude production declines and really doesn't return to levels that it's at today for three to four years, how do you think that affects your business and your capital allocation decisions? Do you think we're going to re-enter an environment that's very complexity oriented? Or do you - is there something else that might be less obvious that you're paying attention to? Anything around that theme would be helpful. Lane Riggs : Hey, this is Lane. Sam, I would say in terms capital allocation, think about the things we're investing in on the refining side is over, right? There's other small caps that always we work on our feedstock flexibility, but to the extent that there's something that has a feedstock, feed element to. That's really more about positioning yourself to continue to run for heavy sour. We built the two crude units to run domestic. I think we think obviously you have to destock, even though there's some production losses going in this. You're going to have to destock domestic crude for a while as there is a recovery. So, we're not making big investments to run additional domestic crude because we think we've done that. So, we don't have - we don't have this sort of projects in the future to try to take more advantage of that. We think we've done it. But we don't really have a lot of projects, big projects that are even pointed at trying to take advantage or do something different on our feedstock collection. Sam Margolin : Thanks. And then just a follow-up on feedstock. You mentioned that high sulfur fuel oil kind of components still look attractive. Certainly, on a percentage to Brent basis, the discount is pretty wide. How do you balance that with sort of your throughput utilization decisions? I would imagine there's some - there's at least some incentive across the board to maybe run ahead of demand. But where do you sort of draw the line between regular way business and what might cross into trading or something that you don't want to be involved? Lane Riggs : That's a really good question. So, what I would say is we - all of our refineries are essentially this open capacity, right? If it's a little bit - it's an interesting place to be when you're trying to do your planning and doing relative values of feedstocks into it. It's open. So we are - it's pretty basic. We are doing our best to try to optimize our feedstock collection into matching demand and trying to be very careful not to run ahead of demand even though there will be a structure that might try to incentivize you to do so. So, we are being very - paying particular attention to doing that. But Gary mentioned that we started out, we were sort of a lot of domestic crude and heavy, and then as this thing unfolded we saw gasoline get weak, which was a disadvantage. Domestic crudes, we sort of went to medium sour and really loaded up on heavy. And as we've seen, gasoline start to pick up and it looks like that's in line. You're seeing us sort of work back, I think, to sort of our traditional posture, it's just we're going to be running less of it. Operator : Our next question will come from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Please go ahead. Ryan Todd : I think maybe just one high level strategic one from me. I know it's hard to speculate at this point, Joe. But if you - if you look into the crystal ball, are there any structural changes you see down the line that are likely to impact your business and may impact the way you allocate capital? I know you talked a little bit about the potential longer-term impact to demand. But you think about overall as you run your business operational practices, regional preferences within the portfolio, long-term calls on capital, are there any structural things coming out of this that you think - that you're thinking about in terms of Valero down the line? Joseph Gorder : Yes. No, we're always thinking about it, right? But you can't run - I said this earlier, I think. You can't run the business based on a short-term set of circumstances. And so, we're reassessing our long-term strategy all the time and we meet with our Board on it to review it every year. But if you look at what we've done, okay, and kind of our approach to the business, I don't know that anybody sitting in the room here with me would consider refining to be a long-term growth story, okay? It's really - it's a business where I think the industry has set itself now to basically match supply and demand going forward. And so, the way we look at it, as we run the business, to maximize the margin that we can capture within the business. And so, our capital is focused on optimization projects and logistics projects which allow us to lower our cost structure of things coming into the plants and going out of the plants. And then just how do we get a little more value out of every stream it is that we process? That's the view that we've adhered to now for several years, and I think it's the view that we're going to adhere to going forward. So, it's a little early right now for me to say that there's any fundamental changes, other than those that we've already implemented around capital, a greater focus on the renewable's, the greener fuels going forward, which we've done with the ethanol business, and with the renewable's, renewable diesel business. But other than that, I just don't envision anything, any major change of direction right now. Operator : Our next question will come from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Gabelman : Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the regional guidance that you provided. You mentioned that Mid-Con demand has been getting stronger, that regional utilization guidance is kind of at the lower end of the range. North Atlantic also, and then U.S. West Coast, looks like those assets are going to be the highest - running at the highest utilization rates in 2Q. So, can you just discuss some of the puts and takes by region that results in that dispersion of run rates? Thanks. Lane Riggs : Jason, I'll take a stab at it. Our view, when Gary was talking about the Mid-Continent and it's getting better, when you think about a refinery operation, when you have a refinery setting in the Mid-Continent, if you get out of balance, it can become - you might end up shutting refinery down. So, we have taken the position on where we are essentially landlocked, to be very cautious on our feedstock plants, with the assumption there's plenty of oil to go get it if we needed to, whatever reason we believe that demand is sticking up. So, it's really around world's demand versus expectations and where are concerns about, sort of the feasibility of our operations where we are landlocked is all these policies around pre-COVID impacted demand. So, that's really where I think Gary talked for. It's just now we see that the Mid-Continent has sort of bottomed out, seems to be recovering a little bit better and it's - so, we have a run - but our plan is to make sure that we have - we are shortening our supply chain and that we can manage it and respond to it quickly and not get ourselves to where we're over committed on supply chain. And in the event that we have - that creates a problem for us if something doesn't quite happen the way that we hope it does. And that's really the narrative all the way across every system that we have. We're just being very careful trying to match the demand with that region, with an understanding that the West Coast, the Mid-Continent is not - you have to get that right. If you don't get - if you get it wrong, you get into some - having to do very uneconomic things to fix those problems. The Gulf Coast, it's a big system. It can go into a lot of different pipelines, servicing a lot of different parts of the country and then ultimately export to sort of satisfy its balance. But even there we're being very cautious. Jason Gabelman : Great. Lane Riggs : Our North America - I mean, the Atlantic is really - we have - we're doing some work in both of those refineries in the second quarter. Jason Gabelman : Got it. Thanks. And just a follow-up on a longer-term margin outlook. Clearly, it looks like demand is starting to improve from the bottoms, but there's a lot of global refining capacity out there that's not being utilized right now and historically refiners have reacted pretty quickly to changes in demand. So, I'm just wondering what your outlook is over the next year, even if demand recovers, if it doesn't come fully back, is there a risk that they're slacking the global refining system that could limit the gains in refining margins until demand more fully recovers? Thanks. Gary Simmons : Yes, this is Gary. I would say certainly there is that risk. But again, I would point to - we've been very encouraged by the discipline the industry has shown. And we're hopeful that maybe what you saw in March in the case that demand fell off sharply and it took a couple of weeks for refineries to modify their operations to come back closer to being in balance with demand, you see a reverse of that as demand picks up and we set our operations to run at lower production rates, maybe you get some big draws. But there's no way for us to really speculate how the industry is going to respond as demand recovers. Jason Gabelman : Got it. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Matthew Blair : If I take midpoint refining throughput guidance against your $450 million OpEx guidance, it looks like your projected total OpEx will be coming down by about $90 million versus Q1 levels. Is that $90 million simply your energy savings on running the boilers at lower rates or are there other areas where you've been able to cut costs as well? Lane Riggs : Yes, this is Lane again. So, if you think about our cost structure in a refinery, you have variable costs and fixed costs. And the variable cost, and it's an interesting thing to think about because in $1.80 for a Henry Hub pricing environment, variable costs, which for us includes FCC catalysts, chemicals, and natural gas to fire our boiler and our heaters. It's really somewhere now down between 15% and 25%. Whereas maybe in years past where natural gas was much more expensive, would have been a bigger component. So, yes, natural gas purchase is a part of that. It's not - it's really - if you look all the way down the line, we have our variable cost as we've cut FCC catalyst, we've cut natural gas. But we've also - we also see our - we reduced our contractor headcount some and looking at very carefully at our sort of discretionary maintenance to also bring that down. Again, trying to be very careful with operating costs. Matthew Blair : Sounds good. And then, could you also talk about your ability to capture contango in this market both for U.S. barrels as well as for your offshore barrels? There's been some reports that refiners are looking to procure additional storage, maybe even like renting out Jones Act tankers. So, can you just walkthrough all that? Lane Riggs : Yes, certainly, the market structure is such that if you can put barrels in tankage whether that's floating storage or tankage in cushing, the market paid you to do that. In terms of our everyday purchases, a lot of the market structure is built into the prices you see and you don't necessarily get a big benefit from market structure except for Mid-Continent barrels that we purchased, and we tend to see a bit when we're contango versus when the market structures in backwardation. It's a pretty complex discussion and I would ask you if you want to go into that in detail you can call Homer and we can setup a discussion to go into more detail about that. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's' question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any further remarks. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Cherry. We appreciate everyone joining us today and hope everyone stays safe and healthy. If you have any follow up questions, as always, don't hesitate to reach out to the IR team. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.  If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.  I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.  Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joseph Gorder : Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. This year has been challenging in many aspects. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing global economic downturn has affected the health and livelihoods of so many people and has had a severe impact on all businesses, including ours. As troubling as our circumstances may be from time to time, it's gratifying to see individuals stepping up, selflessly helping those in need whether it be by providing health care to those that are sick or food to those that are hungry. In this regard, our team is doing its part.  As you probably know, Valero's part of the country's critical infrastructure. As such, our team continues to operate our plants, providing the fuel that our country needs to keep critical supplies and first responders moving. I'm proud that we have not laid off, furloughed or reduced the compensation of any of our 10,000 dedicated employees who continue to give generously, volunteering their time and working courageously and tirelessly through this difficult period.  Our employees are our greatest asset and the heart of our company. Their health, safety and well-being remain among our top priorities. And we'll continue to take the steps necessary to keep them safe whether they work in the field or at our headquarters.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic-imposed shutdown, we had to make important operational and financial decisions. When the stay-at-home orders were first issued, we reduced our refinery and ethanol plant throughput rates to match product supply with demand. We saw demand in April bottom out at 50% of normal demand for gasoline, 70% for diesel and 30% for jet fuel relative to the same period last year.  As the stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions eased through most regions of the U.S. during the second quarter, we saw gasoline and diesel demand recover to 85% to 90% of normal, and jet fuel recovered to 50% of normal. We also saw a recovery in product exports to Latin America and Europe in June. As a result, we prudently increased refining and ethanol throughput rates in step with the increase in product demand.  We also took prudent actions to maintain our financial strength. We lowered our 2020 capital budget by $400 million; raised $1.5 billion of debt at attractive rates; secured an additional credit facility, which remains undrawn; and temporarily suspended the stock buyback program beginning in mid-March this year. And through all of this, we've honored our commitment to capital discipline and maintained our dividend as demonstrated by our Board of Directors approving a quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share earlier this month.  Notwithstanding project deferrals this year, we continue to invest for earnings growth and are making progress on strategic projects under development. The St. Charles Alkylation Unit, which is designed to convert low-value feedstocks into a premium alkylate product, is on track to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year. The Diamond Pipeline expansion and the Pembroke Cogen project are expected to be completed in 2021, and the Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in 2023.  And we remain committed to the expansion of our low-carbon renewable diesel business. The Diamond Green Diesel expansion project is expected to be completed in 2021. This project is expected to increase annual renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year, bringing the total capacity to 675 million gallons per year. In addition, the Diamond Green Diesel continues to make progress on the advanced engineering review for a potential new 400 million gallons per year renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur, Texas facility.  As we focus on the path to recovery with improving product demand, we remain steadfast in the execution of our strategy, pursuing excellence in our operations, investing for earnings growth with lower volatility and honoring our commitment to stockholder returns. We continue to prioritize our investment-grade credit rating and nondiscretionary uses of capital, including sustaining capital expenditures and our dividend. This uncompromising focus on capital discipline and execution has served us well in the current pandemic-imposed downturn, and it should continue to position Valero well through the recovery and beyond. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the second quarter of 2020, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.3 billion or $3.07 per share compared to net income of $612 million or $1.47 per share for the second quarter of 2019.  Second quarter 2020 adjusted net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $504 million or $1.25 per share compared to adjusted net income of $665 million or $1.60 per share for the second quarter of 2019. Second quarter 2020 adjusted results exclude the benefit from an after-tax lower of cost or market or LCM inventory valuation adjustment of approximately $1.8 billion. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany the release. Operating income for the refining segment was $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $1 billion in the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the LCM inventory valuation adjustment, the second quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss for the refining segment was $383 million.  Second quarter 2020 results were impacted by lower product demand and lower prices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.3 million barrels per day, which was lower than the second quarter of 2019 due to lower product demand. Throughput capacity utilization was 74% in second quarter of 2020. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.39 per barrel were $0.59 per barrel higher than the second quarter of 2019 primarily due to the effect of lower throughput rates. Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was $129 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $77 million in the second quarter of 2019. After adjusting for the retroactive Blender's Tax Credit, adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $145 million for the second quarter of 2019.  Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 795,000 gallons per day in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 26,000 gallons per day versus the second quarter of 2019. Operating income for the ethanol segment was $91 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $7 million in the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the benefit from the LCM inventory valuation adjustment, the second quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss for the ethanol segment was $20 million.  Ethanol production volumes averaged 2.3 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2020, which is 2.2 million gallons per day lower than the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in adjusted operating income from the second quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower margins resulting from lower ethanol prices and lower throughput. For the second quarter of 2020, general and administrative expenses were $169 million, and net interest expense was $142 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $578 million, and the income tax expense was $339 million in the second quarter of 2020. The effective tax rate was 20%, which was affected by the results of certain of our international operations that are taxed at rates that are lower than the U.S. statutory rate.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $736 million in the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of $629 million as well as our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in its working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $38 million. With regard to investing activities, we made $503 million of capital investments in the second quarter of 2020, of which approximately $240 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance. Approximately $263 million of the total was for growing the business. Excluding our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's capital investments, Valero's capital investments were approximately $448 million.  Moving to financing activities. We returned $400 million to our stockholders in the second quarter of 2020 through our dividend, resulting in a year-to-date total payout ratio of 96% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. As of June 30, we had approximately $1.4 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. And on July 16, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share, further demonstrating our sound financial position and commitment to return cash to our investors. With respect to balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $12.7 billion, and cash and cash equivalents were $2.3 billion. The debt capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents, was 33%. At the end of June, we had $5.7 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We still expect annual capital investments for 2020 to be approximately $2.1 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments, with about 60% allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. Approximately 30% of our overall growth CapEx for 2020 is allocated to expanding our renewables business. For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.4 million to 1.45 million barrels per day, U.S. Mid-Continent at 380,000 to 400,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 215,000 to 235,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 375,000 to 395,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be approximately $4.40 per barrel.  With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2020. Operating expenses in 2020 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.20 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.  For the third quarter, net interest expense should be about $145 million. And total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $580 million. For 2020, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $825 million. And we expect the RINs expense for the year to be between $400 million and $500 million. Lastly, as discussed on our last earnings call due to the impact of the beneficial tax provisions in the CARES Act as well as the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, we are not providing any guidance on our effective tax rate for 2020.  That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Prashant Rao of Citigroup. Prashant Rao : So I wanted to start on the demand recovery. Joe, you mentioned the rapid recovery in product demand through 2Q. Can we get a sense of the strength of product demand as we entered the current quarter and how it's been trending since? And if you could, any color on how to think about that in terms of buckets of gasoline versus jet versus diesel and everything else? Joseph Gorder : Yes. Sure. Gary, you want to? Gary Simmons : Yes, sure. I'll walk you through it. So I'll start with gasoline. As Joe mentioned, we saw demand fall off to about 50% of what we would normally have. Our export volumes fell to about 1/3 of where they would typically be in the second quarter. But as you mentioned, demand has certainly recovered faster than most people have expected. By May, we were at 77% normal gasoline demand in our system. In June, 88% of normal, and we've continued to see recovery as we transition into July.  On the export side, as I mentioned, we bottomed out about 1/3 of the volume we typically export in the quarter. By June, we were back to 70% of our normal export volume. July, with the estimates we have today, we'd be about 76% of normal on our export volume. So gasoline demand has recovered much faster than certainly most would have expected and appears to be pretty strong.  On the distillate side, the magnitude of the demand destruction wasn't nearly as great. As we mentioned, we fell off to about 70% of typical demand. But diesel demand recovered pretty quickly back to about 80% of normal. In our system, we've remained about 80% to 85% of normal demand. However, that's below what the DOE was reporting. The DOE is closer to 94% diesel demand. I think the difference there is certainly in our Three Rivers and the key system, we had a lot of diesel going into the upstream sector. And with lower drilling activity, we're seeing a little less diesel demand than maybe we're seeing nationwide. Also just like gasoline in the export market, we fell off to about 1/3 of our typical export volume in May. Just like gasoline has recovered at a pretty good pace, actually stronger. In June, we were back to about 45% of our normal export demand. And things have really picked up for diesel export demand in July. Our current estimate for July, we showed July export volume's 107% of where they were in July of 2019. I think the other thing that's really interesting when you look at the export numbers is looking at those export numbers in light of the U.S. Gulf Coast diesel production. So if you look at our export volumes last year in July, we exported about 1/3 of what our refineries produced, the diesel they produced. July of this year with our estimate on exports to be 47%. So almost half of what our refineries are making are going to the export markets. On the jet side, we can also seeing recovery in demand. This week's DOE stats would show jet demand about 60% of normal. I think the DOE data really highlights the importance of the recovery in jet demand because as jet demand has recovered, you've seen diesel yields from refinery fall off significantly. So where we've peaked at about 39% diesel yield, that's come down to about 32% diesel yield. As you continue to see jet demand recovery, you'll see diesel yield fall off from the refineries, which will really help the diesel supply demand balances. I think on the jet side, that would be the only sign that we're seeing that's a little bit troubling. Certainly with some of the renewed efforts to slow the spread of the pandemic and many of the states shutting down, we don't have a lot of good line of sight into jet demand, but some of our nominations for August demand are down a little bit from what we saw in July. Prashant Rao : Excellent. That's a great answer. My follow-up is just on the balance sheet. Net debt-to-cap held in pretty well sequentially. And free cash flow, including the working cap tailwind, was positive in the quarter. Given what we're seeing in the demand recovery and the commentary around where we are in 3Q, if we can hold at these levels, if not improve slowly from here, does it feel like you're already starting to turn the corner a bit on the balance sheet? That is to say the defensive measures that you've taken so far this year feel sufficient to ride out this downturn, absent another pullback in demand? Joseph Gorder : Yes, why don't we let Jason take a shot at that? Jason Fraser : Hey, this is Jason. Yes. I think you're right. With the liquidity we have now, the $2.3 billion in cash and $5.7 billion of other liquidity available, we do think that's adequate for what we see this -- how we see it playing out right now. Prashant Rao : Okay. Fantastic. And Jason, congrats on the promotion and stepping into the new role. I look forward to talking to you more on that front in the future. Jason Fraser : Thanks. I appreciate it. Joseph Gorder : Thanks, Prashant. Operator : The next question is from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Theresa Chen : Just a quick follow-up on Prashant's question related to the demand side and your commentary about LatAm. The current estimates of, I think it was 107% versus normalized levels that you're seeing, how much of that you think is pent-up demand? Or is it sustainable? And related, do you think that any of the refineries that were previously maybe not optimal or operating at optimized capacity would perhaps permanently shut down or be permanently impaired economically in that region such that perhaps you can take some market share going forward? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think what we've seen, at least for the export markets we go to in Latin America, their demand recovery has been very close to the same type demand recovery we're seeing in the United States. I do think you may have some prefilling of inventories getting ready for winter, which could cause exports to spike a little bit. But in our system, we see a pretty steady flow of diesel volume to Latin America, and the volumes are fairly constant. Where we really get a spike in our export volumes is when the arb to Europe is open. And that arb is currently open as it has been much of July, and that's where a lot of that incremental volume is going. Theresa Chen : Got it. And then switching to the differential front. So we seem to have several pipeline or projects in regulatory purgatory. And just given your expansive commercial presence, I'd be interested to hear your views on how differentials could react specifically to DAPL. So if the pipe is shut down, how do you think that will impact not only Bakken differentials, but also WTI? And do you think that could create perhaps like a pull on Cushing? What are your thoughts here? Gary Simmons : Yes. So definitely, if DAPL isn't allowed to operate, it certainly will pressure the Bakken differentials. We could see that moving weaker. Enbridge came out yesterday. They have some efforts to improve their capacity to help clear the Bakken. Of course, through that Enbridge system, we are connected. We are our line 9 to Qu\u00e9bec. So we'd have an opportunity to bring that Bakken volume to Qu\u00e9bec, which would be a benefit for us.  In terms of the WTI differentials, I think with where we are on the forecast for production and where pipeline capacity is, I don't see it really having a significant impact on the WTI differentials. I think we're kind of in a mode where Brent-TI probably is in that $2 to $3 range based on the incremental cost to get it to the Gulf and clear. Theresa Chen : Understood. Congratulations to Jason as well. Jason Fraser : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Manav Gupta of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Manav Gupta : First is a more of a policy question at this point. Joseph Gorder : Hey, Manav, we can barely hear you, man. Manav Gupta : So is it better now? Joseph Gorder : Sorry. Manav Gupta : Yes. So on the policy side, at this point, President Joe Biden's clean energy agenda does not have renewable diesel in it, but there is a school of thought that you can't post the big trucks and buses to go on electric, but you can encourage them to go on renewable diesel. Do you see a chance that the clean energy agenda of the Democratic nominee expands and includes renewable diesel at some point of time? Joseph Gorder : Manav, everybody fainted when you made your first proclamation. We'll let Rich Halls take a shot at the answer, okay? Unidentified Company Representative : So we have some familiarity with Biden and some of his priorities. And one of the things that I would point out is that nobody's going to want to take the union jobs away that are associated with the manufacturing that we have out there. There's a huge amount of infrastructure in the country that's based on that.  Same thing with the renewable fuels. I don't think that any administration that comes in is going to want to pull the rug out from under the farmlands. And so we see the renewable diesel having a big role to play, a significant role of play. And I know there's a lot of aspirational statements and positions out there about electrification, but there's a big marketplace for renewable diesel, and we think it fits strongly in the [indiscernible]. Joseph Gorder : Martin, anything you want to add to that? Martin Parrish : No, I'd just echo that. When you look at -- when you get to the true numbers, if you look at the carbon intensity, renewable diesel competes very well with so-called zero-emission vehicle. You're already up to 16%, 18% renewable diesel in California. You've got mandates out to 2030 in California and Europe, the clean fuel standard coming in Canada, New York proceeding. So we just -- as Rich said, we just feel really good about the future and the growth and just see this worldwide globally as in the fuel mix for a long time to come. Manav Gupta : That was helpful. One quick follow-up. So the Monday indicators which you put out, which are very helpful, are basically indicating that when you look at all the regions versus May, every region is showing some improvement. But Gulf Coast, where your most of your capacity is actually showing a $3 per barrel improvement, so I'm just trying to understand, on the margin front, why is the rate of change on the Gulf Coast showing a better positive variance versus some of the other regions? Gary Simmons : Probably the biggest variance is due to the crude differentials. So crude differentials have been very tight, but we've seen medium sours move $0.60 in the last few days, and we've seen the Canadian heavy move $1. And so on our Gulf Coast, we run a lot more of the medium and heavy sours, and so that would have the positive impact on the margin indicator versus the other regions, which are primarily sweet. Operator : The next question is from Paul Sankey of Hubbard. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, it's Analyst Hub, actually, not Hubbard. But anyway, Joe, it's been a long 6 months, 4 months since we last spoke. And I was wondering the extent to which you feel world has changed on a secular basis. Obviously, you've referred to the demand side, and we can debate how air travel and what suburbanization is more gasoline intense, but clearly, you've accessed capital. You've seen very clearly to be restating the dividend commitment that you've had since you became CEO.  I guess one question would be where you think we're going in terms of how U.S. crude markets change? It does seem that we're in for a very different outlook now in terms of how much available crude there is in the U.S. and how the balance will shift. Equally, we've heard a reference already, and thanks for the about how the election may change things, but any further comments you have on that would be very interesting. Joseph Gorder : Yes, you bet. Paul, I mean, just looking back over the last 6 months, it's been a bit of a roller coaster, right? When we started off the year in pretty decent shape, and then we had the incredible trough. Most of us in this room have been in this business for a very long time. And you got to look back a lot of quarters before you see a quarter like the second quarter of this year. It was just brutal. I mean, the margins were just horrible.  And so anyway, the one thing that we're focused on really is that we're going to run the business for the long term. And we need to have a steady hand right now and just continue to focus on doing what we do and doing it well. We're dealing with news that's barraging us every day with negative commentary, and people are fearful. And we've got an election coming on. And you and I probably could have a lively conversation about the impacts of that.  But frankly, we're coming out of this. And I think if you look at our country and the way that people want to live, it is not the way that they lived over the last quarter. So anyway, I'll stop there. Gary, talk a little bit about crude situation? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think most forecast we see confirm what you're talking about. As total oil demand picks up, I think a greater percentage of that gets filled with more sour production. Our view is that the U.S. will still be a net exporter of crude oil. And as long as the U.S. is exporting crude oil, we'll continue to have advantage on the light sweet barrels we're bringing into our system. And then of course, with the flexibility that we have, especially with our complex Gulf Coast refining assets, getting some more medium and heavy sour barrels on the market will help us as well from that aspect. Joseph Gorder : And then as far as your -- no, Paul, and you mentioned the election. And we don't have a crystal ball on what's going to happen. But we do know that if you just look fundamentally at where we are, the products that we produce are necessary for life as we know it. And so you can have a lot of conversation around what we're going to do and what needs to -- but in reality, fossil fuels are going to be with us for a very long time. And demand forecast continue to be for increased crude oil consumption going forward as countries continue to develop and so on. So we just need to not get hung up in the -- think we're going to be in this dungeon that we're in now forever. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. I mean, obviously, a vaccine would change that. I think I've read from your comments very clearly that the strength of demand is really impressive. If you think we've just printed minus 30% GDP, and we've got yesterday, gasoline demand down 8%, it's actually quite incredible. Joseph Gorder : You bet. Take care. Operator : The next question is from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Douglas Terreson : So my question is on supply and specifically how you guys are thinking about closures of refining capacity over the next several years. And the reason that I ask is because I think IEA's final tally of closures last cycle was 6 million, 7 million barrels per day of supply. And between recent closure announcements that we've seen in Asia, related factors and current refining economics, it seems like we could be on a similar track for the next couple of years as well. So I just want to see your thinking about how the supply side could be affected by this factor in coming years. And is there really any reason to believe it will be much different from the drag for the last cycle? Lane Riggs : Doug, this is Lane. So we've always sort of had the view that really what shuts refineries down, obviously, they have to have some sort of fundamental issue, whether it's -- they're configured incorrectly for where the market is or some other structural things. But ultimately, what closes them as either a big environment -- a big regulatory change where it requires a lot of capital, and it just becomes like you should look at the whole sort of scenario of cash flow. And it becomes insurmountable, and you start trying to normally try to sell and then ultimately it shuts down.  The other one that does that is it could be like a big turnaround. We visited a refinery few years we've got back in the U.K., and that's essentially what got them. They had a -- they put off a turnaround and had kept doing that. And ultimately, that was a big SEC alky cracking complex turnaround, the cost of which got to be where it was so large, they chose to shut it down. So it's really big refineries if they can just sort of kind of move along and manage expenses and things like that, but it's when if a refinery has an outlook based on configuration or fundamentals, it makes it negative to begin with. And then they had, there's a large cash outflow due to something changing, that's generally what gets these refineries. Operator : The next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Philip Gresh : First question here, just -- obviously, you've referenced the demand picture improving into July quite a bit. That said, the crack spreads are still pretty soft here in July and as we head into August. So as you look at the second half of the year and look to balance the supply against the demand and the current inventory picture, do you think demand is going to be able to take care of the inventory situation? Do you think we're in a situation where we need to underproduce through the second half of the year in a greater extent to get inventories lower? Lane Riggs : Hey, this is Lane again. So we ultimately believe, to get back to more normalized economic sort of drivers for our business, we need to get back into sort of the 5-year range for inventories. There's three paths you talked about. There's really how does the demand look, and how disciplined are refiners with respect to their utilization rates? And then, of course, finally, it's just a matter of how many closures there are. Our view is that we've been really impressed so far with the industry's response to this in terms of being disciplined and been encouraged by that. But certainly, as we move forward, seeing how jet demand works and obviously, the seasonality with respect to butane going in the pool, we expect that utilization rates will sort of be commensurate with where the economics are. And somewhere, and then I'm going to say early next year, our view is we'll get sort of back into the 5-year range of inventories. Philip Gresh : Okay. Got it. So I guess, with your view then just extrapolate that a little further to kind of the medium-term outlook, would you think by the middle of next year, do you think that would imply margins could get back to some kind of normalized level if demand continues to improve? Or just how are you thinking about things in terms of structurally a normalized picture moving forward? Lane Riggs : A normalized world looks like the inventories are basically back into the 5-year band. That's how sort of -- that's how we sort of look at it. And yes, we believe some more time next year, but we should be back into that sort of market. Operator : The next question is from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : So my question is about the net potential DGD expansion. You mentioned you're in engineering. At this point, the kit seems pretty well established. The underlying fundamentals of the business are good. I think what you said is reasonable that there's a high probability that in other markets that have a credit system or a carbon price that are comparable to California. So this business is growing. So I guess my question is on this evaluation, what are the inputs that you're watching? Is it more commercial? Or are you really evaluating some design changes or some other aspect of the expiration in front of FIP here? Martin Parrish : Sam, this is Martin. We're really just going through our gated process and the work. This is a new location. So there's other things that you take care of, the off sites, the integration with the refinery. So it's really not -- I wouldn't say -- I think commercially and operationally, we feel pretty good about where we're at. It's just really doing the work you have to do to get to a cost estimate and the rigor that we apply to these things. So we're still on track. We're -- expect to make a final investment decision in early 2021. And if we go forward, we would expect to start construction in 2021 and operations commencing in 2024. Operator : The next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Douglas Leggate : And Jason, you're -- let me add my congrats. So looks like you're jumping into the fire at a pretty interesting time. So good luck with everything. Jason Fraser : Thank you. Douglas Leggate : Joe, at the beginning of this -- at the beginning of March, when Saudi launched its flow pillar of crude to the United States, I seem to recall you talking about getting calls relating to your ability to absorb that crude. And obviously, we saw a huge increase in export or import from Saudi, essentially at the end of May. That appears to have tailed off now. And I'm just wondering if you can walk us through your prognosis for heavy availability and crude spreads in light of what I just suggested. Joseph Gorder : Yes, Doug. Gary can speak to this really well. Gary Simmons : Yes, Doug. So I think for us, we've certainly seen spreads about as narrow as we've ever seen with our margin for light sweet, medium sour and heavy sour all right on top of each other. As we look forward, OPEC has 2 million barrels a day coming online in August. It looks like Canadian production will ramp up somewhere in the 200- to 300-barrel a day range. And so we're already starting to see that have an impact on the market.  I mentioned medium sour discounts have widened about $0.60 in the last week. Canadian heavies moved about $1 a barrel weaker. Longer term, the forecast we see show that as total oil demand increases, a much larger percentage of that total oil demand will be filled with sour-type production rather than the light sweet, which came off the market. And so we think all of that could lead to wider quality differentials as we move forward longer term. Douglas Leggate : Okay. I appreciate that. I don't want to make this my second question, but just a footnote to that, Gary. Our understanding from quality curve or associated with it [indiscernible] at the center of energy studies in Russia, he suggests that the increase from Saudi and Russia would be absorbed domestically. So do you believe that those vials are actually hitting the water? Gary Simmons : We have seen some barrels from the [indiscernible] show up in the U.S. Gulf or on offer in the U.S. Gulf, which we haven't seen in quite some time. So Basra has been an offer, which we haven't seen in quite some time. So I think some of the barrels are making their way onto the water into the market. And some of that is also due to the fact it looks like Far East buying is down a little bit as well, which is also helping to pressure the crude differentials and make our barrels available to us. Douglas Leggate : I appreciate that. So Joe, my second question, and I apologize in advance, it is a policy question in light of what we're seeing in the polls and so on. And it's really just ask you if you would mind articulating Valero's position on carbon tax, and I'll leave it there. Joseph Gorder : Okay. No, that's great. I mean -- and again, we'll get Rich. Rich is responsible for our government affairs activities. We'll get him to comment on this. But Doug, we're seeing different proposals coming out, right? I mean Biden's got a position he's taken, and the House is looking at things and so on. We don't know what's going to come out of this yet, okay? We just really don't. And because nothing seems to have been settled on. But that being said, Rich, just want to kind of share what our thoughts are? Unidentified Company Representative : Yes. I mean, it's a little bit hard to respond to it in the abstract, right, because it all depends on how the tax is structured, right? If you're looking at a properly structured carbon tax, you've got to consider is the carbon tax going to drive carbon offshore to unregulated environment? You'll need to structure around that. It needs to be market-driven. You need to think about affordability. You need to think about complexity in structuring it, and not picking winners and losers just by virtue of it, letting it actually allow all carbon reduction options to play into the market is really important.  The other thing I think you should temper all of this with is considering the state of the economy right now. I mean, any administration that gets elected is going to be dealing with a COVID recovery economy, and you need energy to drive the economy. You can't really want to drive stimulus in the economy and then layer a bunch of taxes on and completely restructure the energy format for the nation. It's really not feasible.  So I think you're going to -- the next administration, it's going to be about the economy, and the economy is going to need energy. And so while there's a lot of hyperbole in the campaign and a lot of aspirational statements, the reality is that they're going to need strong fuels to keep the economy going. So I guess in summary, we just need to see what they're going to do before we can say what our position would be on it. Operator : The next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Roger Read : A lot has just been hit here. But I guess one question I'll throw at you on the refining side. We've heard talk in some of the other companies about delays and deferrals on maintenance and how that may affect what's available to run, meaning maybe a little higher this fall and winter, but maybe lower next spring as people get, let's say, we get past the worst of the pandemic and all that. As you think probably, Lane, this question's for you, as you think about getting inventories back to the 5-year average, is that something that we should factor in as an additional help? Or there's enough surplus capacity everywhere if demand stays kind of soft that maybe we won't really notice anything on the maintenance deferral side? Lane Riggs : Hey, Roger, so I think it's really a function of how that operator responds to some of this. So for example, one of the things that we did when we saw and when this all first started is we took the opportunity to have Pembroke FCC down and on its fractionator, right? So we actually incurred additional maintenance expense to deal with what we thought was an acute issue around its operation. We could have tried to get through that and get it to its turnaround next year. But we thought, you know what, let's just get and get that cleaned out and also help with this sort of just the sort of structural demand destruction that was early on.  So I think it all depends on the operator. An operator who's stressed, they have their balance sheet stress or access to capital is -- and debt is a little bit stressed, they may, in fact, decide to defer a lot of maintenance to some other point because they got to get through -- they got a liquidity issue, and they got to get to -- they got to push it out to a point at which they hope that there's enough recovery they can afford to do these things. The risk in that is that the unit, the unit doesn't really know how good your balance sheet is or how the world is. It just sort of the size. And at that point, if that unit goes down, it's an unplanned event, it becomes a much larger event. It's a much more expensive event. And that's the risk an operator in that condition has to deal with.  But Valero specifically, we didn't have a lot of turnaround work going into the sort of even planned turnaround work in the third and fourth quarter. We'll still address where we think we have operating issues. And so -- and the other general comment I'll say is, yes, we reduced expenses. One of those was, I would call it, light maintenance. You can sort of tell from the way I talk.  We have just sort of core value of ours is that we will never ever cut our maintenance capital such as it puts our reliability at risk because we believe that's a pathway to get to even higher expenses and more cash outlay in the future because we believe in being in this in the long term. So we don't operate that way, but we did touch lightly on some of what we consider to be a little bit of discretionary maintenance. So the debt -- does that answer your question? Roger Read : Yes, I think so. I mean, it's obviously a lot of moving parts to it. I'm just trying to, where we can, understand some of the things that are going to be coming at us here other than what... Lane Riggs : Just what I'm trying to say is it's very operator specific. If you think -- if you like to look out there, the cast of characters, the people who are in this business, some people will respond by being careful, and some people might have to take an additional risk. And then it all -- and then it's just a matter of how it all unfolds. Roger Read : No. I appreciate that. I guess the other question I have is to follow-up on the earlier comment about the diesel yield going from the high 30s to the low 30s as jet fuel demand comes back up. As we look overall at what's been coming in the last several weeks on the DOE is we've seen gasoline draws a little bit on net. Diesel's actually been continuing to build. Are we at a point here where jet fuel demand has recovered enough that we should see the lower diesel yields feed into no longer building diesel margins? Or kind of maybe tag teaming on Phil's question. Are we in a situation here where maybe we face, I don't know, overall run cuts or a further cut in diesel yields in order to kind of balance the market?  And one of the reasons I'm asking that is as we roll late September into October, we go from summer-grade to winter-grade gasoline, and so that tends to make it easier to make gasoline. And I was just curious if that further complicates thing if we don't see a continued improvement in jet fuel demand. Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think our view is we don't see where jet fuel demand fully recovers to where we were, and that jet fuel demand picks up and up to really correct the yield issue, which is where it gets really to Lane's point. For us to really see diesel inventories get back to that 5-year average low of total light product inventories in that 5-year average range, we really need to see discipline on the utilization. And to keep utilization down is probably the biggest key to getting inventory. Operator : The next question is from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Two questions. Since that Jason is now the CFO. So Jason, do you have any preliminary outlook for 2021 CapEx? If not the exact amount but whether it's going to be flat up or down comparing to this year? Joseph Gorder : Yes. Paul, hey. So we haven't given the guidance yet as you well know. But... Paul Cheng : That why I asked [indiscernible] outlook. Joseph Gorder : So I would -- I'm going to say this right now, okay? The high end would be $2.5 billion and then probably $2 billion on the low end, okay? I think we just need to wait and see what happen. Lane's got us really well positioned on the execution of the capital plan that if we need to delay a project or continue to slow some of these projects, we'll do it.  I think we're very highly confident. We're just going to continue to proceed with the Diamond Green Diesel project. Jason Fraser : We haven't slowed down now. Joseph Gorder : Yes, we're not going to slow that down. So Paul, I'd say, $2 billion. And if we see the -- as guys have talked about, to get really back to a really strong margin environment, we need to see inventories come down some. That could happen sooner than later, but we just don't know. But I think to the extent we can restart some of these capital projects, we'd like to do it, okay?  I think we've talked before, Jason, we've talked about this, that if you're going to prioritize your use of funds in the company, one of the first things we'd like to do is go ahead and restart these high-return capital projects like the coker, then we're going to look at the balance sheet to be sure that we reduce our debt and that we build some cash. And then ultimately, Paul, we would look at share repurchases. So anyway, that's kind of our sequencing around the use of cash. Paul Cheng : And Jason, what is the debt level you need to bring back down to before you will consider the other maybe shareholder return options? Joseph Gorder : Bring capital down to or you saying? Paul Cheng : No. And at that level you want to bring it down to. Because I would imagine that when you start generating free cash, maybe one of the priorities that you want to bring down your debt. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if that is the first priority, then at what point the debt level you will say, okay, wow, that we still want it to be down more so that this that we could have more balance between increasing the return to shareholders and reducing that at the same time. Jason Fraser : Okay. Yes. Our guidance on our capital allocation framework as we target 20% to 30%. That's a good guideline. There's not an absolute hard and fast rule. That's a good thought. Joseph Gorder : But Paul, you know what kind of debt we've got out there. I mean, in the past, and we'll continue to look at it. We do regularly. But it's been prohibitively expensive for us to go out and call debt, okay? And so we look at it. And Jason, Steve looks at it all the time. It just hasn't made sense to do in the past, and we'll continue to look for going forward. Paul Cheng : Okay. A final question for me on my side. In the event you're being [indiscernible] the supply alternative, Gary, can you maybe elaborate a little bit? Gary Simmons : Yes. So we -- throughout the history, we've really supplied the Qu\u00e9bec refinery over the water, can fully supply Qu\u00e9bec with waterborne barrels. Line 9 is an optimization for us. It's provided a nice economic benefit to us, but we have the ability to supply Qu\u00e9bec either West African barrels or barrels from the U.S. Gulf Coast over the water. Paul Cheng : But is there any option or opportunity to fund additional North American supply? Or that's really what Line 9 is just that's winning that no additional well we'll be able to gain more local supply or that Calgary or that Bakken supply into that? Gary Simmons : So the line that's really close is Line 5, and not all of Line 9 is fed from Line 5. So even if Line 5 is closed, we still believe we'd have access to Western Canadian barrels that could feed Line 9. Paul Cheng : How does that work actually? Is it the rate? Line 5 is shut and that assumes that the total available in Line 9 become, say, call it half. Is it you will get half of your normal allocation? Or how does that work, the process? Gary Simmons : That's close to how it would work. So there would be a progression that goes into effect based on your shipper history. And so where we would fall out on that, I'm not sure. But assuming Line 5 is half of the volume and everyone was to 50%, then would be 50% of what we normally ship through Line 9. Operator : The next question is from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Bradley Heffern : Joe, you've had the 40% to 50% cash return target for a long time now. I'm curious if we end up in a sort of longer margin recovery environment, maybe like we softer the financial crisis, how long you're comfortable sort of paying above that target as you are now before potentially the dividend could need to be addressed? Joseph Gorder : Okay. We'll let Jason talk generally how we're thinking about cash flows and the dividend here, okay? Jason Fraser : You're right. We're well above it. Now I think Homer said, we're at 96% year-to-date on payout. But with this being an extraordinary and short-term event, we're not going to -- we don't adjust that based on this type of a situation. So we stick with our guidance. We won't vary from it. I don't know if we have an exact number on how long we would be comfortable with that. Joseph Gorder : No, we do not. Bradley Heffern : Yes. Okay. And then, I guess, sort of along the same lines, have your thoughts changed at all about the repurchase program, just given what we've seen? I mean, obviously, the historical has been that when you have money to do repurchases, obviously, the stock price is higher. And that's certainly proven to be true this time. So is there a chance that on the other side, we see Valero with sustain a higher cash balance and a lower overall debt level than maybe we thought previously? Any color like that would be great. Joseph Gorder : So you want to talk about it or you me to? I'll tell you, it's -- again, I think the key to remember here is we're in kind of a funky, short-term, what we consider to be a short-term period, okay? And we're going to evaluate it. We don't know what next week is going to hold or what the next month is going to hold or the next year.  And so what we're doing is sticking to what we've done in the past, and we're comfortable with it right now. We are well positioned going into it. We've looked at how we're positioned today versus where we were back in '09 when we had a previous downturn. We stress test everything.  So we're not willing right now to make decisions with long-term implications based on what we consider to be a short term set of circumstances. So we're just going to play this out. We'll see what happens. Operator : The next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : The first question I have is just on DGD margins. You've been following the indicator margins on your website. They came in a little softer than what we expected in the second quarter. Volumes looked good. But just any thoughts on 2020 DGD margins would be helpful. Martin Parrish : Yes, Neil, this is Martin. I can tell you, the second quarter was $1.93 a gallon EBITDA, which we actually feel pretty good about it. If you look now where we're at relative to the second quarter, diesel price's up $0.27 a gallon. The D4 RIN component with the multiplier's up $0.12 a gallon. So you're close to $0.40 a gallon better on the indicator margin than we were in the second quarter with those components. So looking out for the rest of the year, we feel really good about where DGD is going to be for the rest of the year and foreseeable future. Neil Mehta : That's great. And then that brings us to the follow-up. Just your thoughts on RIN and particularly the D6 RIN and just how it could play out from here and it kind of ties back into some of the election mentioned earlier? Martin Parrish : Well, right now, we expect RINs to remain supported in the near term. There's a lot going on. You've got low energy prices relative to agricultural prices, and that makes the biofuels less competitive, which typically means a higher RIN. You've got uncertainty around the small refinery exemption program. And obviously, effects of COVID-19 on gasoline. You just don't know if you can -- the gasoline pool will absorb the mandated ethanol volumes next year. So that's a risk.  And then the EPA, the 2021 RVO itself has been postponed indefinitely. So there's just a lot of uncertainty around the RIN right now. So as a result, it's higher. Once we turn the corner on the pandemic, we get lower energy price and energy prices, excuse me, recovered at higher levels, we expect the RINs to drift lower. Operator : The next question is from Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies. Christopher Sighinolfi : I do have two questions. I guess, first, following up on Roger's earlier question. With changes in product slate and unit configuration and perhaps the swing into winter grade, how high could you push gasoline yield if demand there continues to rebound and for jet and distillate? Maybe it doesn't? And on a related note, are you changing at all the crude procurement processes, just given the pace and degree of change and uncertainty with regard to individual product demand over the last couple of months and maybe continuing for the next couple of months? Lane Riggs : Gasoline yield, it's probably to give you a really good answer in terms of if you were in a mode of trying to maximize gasoline and minimize distillate. It would be -- it's probably in the order of 50%, low 50% sort of yields overall. In the independents, it's obviously a function of different refineries. Our Venetia refinery makes like 60% gasoline, and so it's our Mckee refinery. Some of the more heavy refineries are a little bit different. So it's really a function of the refineries. And if the world works out the way, where gasoline is recovered and jet doesn't recover and consequently, you got to be careful. But we'll certainly test the limits of that probably going into probably first quarter and going into second quarter depending on again how disciplined refiners are for the rest of the year. Gary Simmons : On crude, I guess, early in the second quarter when gasoline got very weak, we pushed a little bit more medium sour into our system to try to promote higher distillate yield. Since then we backed off, and we're in a real similar crude diet to what we typically run. And I don't see that changing in the near future. Christopher Sighinolfi : Okay. Great. And Lane, I appreciate the early discussion of product inventories and sort of your expectations as we move into next year. For my own edification, when you think about recapturing 5-year inventory ranges and the signal that, that inventory normalization might send to prices and cracks, do you think about that in an absolute sense? Or do you think about it in terms of a days of demand ratio? I know it's a conceptual question, I guess, with all this shadow inventory represented by the low refining utilization rates. I'm just curious how you and your team think about those components. Lane Riggs : That's an excellent question. We always -- because obviously, there's just different demand through time. And so it's not just -- we look at where inventories are in the 5-year range. That's sort of where we start. And then we certainly start looking at days of supply. And then we look forward, are there inventories that maybe the DOE is not capturing that's somewhere else out there. And so we look at all those things, for sure.  But I guess it's sort of at a high level, we're just saying there's the industry needs to be disciplined. It needs to -- and there's -- and obviously, demand's on its way back. We want to see what is normalized inventory to be in the 5-year range. And then we start looking at days of supply, are there inventories in unusual places that we'll take into account. Operator : The last question today comes from Benny Wong of Morgan Stanley. Benny Wong : I'll keep it to one. I just want to be mindful of your time. Just kind of looking at your renewable diesel, your business margin there came in at like $1.95, which was a little bit better than what we expected. But when we look at spot prices, the business margin looks like it would be much better, maybe even close to 2 50, 2 75. When we kind of put aside movement in commodity prices is there any reasons or factors that we should not expect the same magnitude of index price recovery to flow into your business margin in 3Q and the back half of the year? Martin Parrish : This is Martin. As I said earlier, we've seen quite a bit of recovery since the 2Q average numbers in both the diesel price and the RIN. LCFS price is flat. So I would say you ought to expect kind of what we've guided to before that we feel pretty good about third and fourth quarter for renewable diesel. Benny Wong : Got it. Okay. Appreciate that. So there's nothing within like movement in capture rates and costs that we might have to incrementally think upon in the back half of the year. Is that right? Martin Parrish : That's correct. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the call back to Homer Bhullar for closing remarks. Homer Bhullar : Thank you. We appreciate everyone joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to call the IR team. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference.

There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joseph Gorder : Thanks Homer and good morning everyone. The third quarter was another challenging period in which refining margins continue to be pressured by pandemic imposed restrictions on global economies. These restrictions have limited individual movement and in-person activities across the globe, resulting in lower demand for finished refinery products. This in turn, has created less incentive to produce crude oil and has led to narrower crude oil discounts compared to last year. Despite this challenging environment, there were a number of positive developments from the previous quarter, as product demand increased with incremental easing of restrictions on businesses, and the reopening of some schools. Relative to the second quarter, DOE statistics show the gasoline, diesel and jet demand improved by 25%, 7% and 57% respectively, which is in-line with the increase in demand, that we experienced across our system. Our wholesale volumes remain steady, moving over 50% of our total light products production. Our gasoline and distillate exports to Latin America and Europe were also robust in the third quarter. We exported 316,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, which is significantly higher than the 170,000 barrels per day we exported in the second quarter. We also saw a steady increase in our wholesale volumes into Mexico, where we have been proactively expanding our logistics network for the last several years. In fact, Valero is now one of the largest, private fuel importers into Mexico. With the incremental easing of restrictions and higher product demand, our refinery utilization increased from 74% in the second quarter to 80% in the third quarter and we increased our ethanol plant production as well from 49% to 81% of capacity. Our low-carbon renewable diesel business remains resilient, with another quarter of solid performance, realizing a margin of $2.72 per gallon and setting a record for sales volumes. In addition, we remain well capitalized. We ended the quarter with over $4 billion of cash and almost $10 billion of total available liquidity. While we expect margins to improve as economies continue to reopen and product inventories come down to normal levels, we opportunistically raised another $2.5 billion of debt at very attractive rates to ensure that we're able to keep our high return projects on track and to honor our commitment to shareholders. Even if the current low-margin environment persist for longer than currently anticipated. Turning to capital investments, we continue to execute on announced projects that are expected to drive long-term earnings growth. The St. Charles Alkylation Unit, which is designed to convert low-value feedstocks into a premium alkylate product, remains on track to be completed in the fourth quarter. The Diamond Pipeline expansion and the Pembroke Cogen project are expected to be completed in 2021 and the Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in 2023. We're also evaluating a number of other low carbon growth projects that are in the development phase of our gated process. Now, we continue to strengthen our long-term competitive advantage with investments in our renewable diesel business. The Diamond Green Diesel expansion project at St. Charles, which is designed to increase renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year to 675 million gallons per year is still expected to be completed in 2021. Diamond Green Diesel also continues to make progress on the advanced engineering review for a potential new 400 million gallons per year renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur, Texas refinery. As we look ahead, we expect to see improvement in margins, as product inventories approach the normal five year range. U.S. gasoline inventory is already in the middle of the five-year range. And although distillate inventory is higher than the five-year range, it's been trending downwards in recent weeks. Diesel demand should continue to improve, supported by winter heating oil demand and harvest season. Oil refinery turnarounds coupled with recently announced and anticipated closures or conversions of less advantage refineries, should also further balance supply. Although there is a lot of uncertainty in the market, we remain steadfast in the execution of our strategy, pursuing excellence in operations, investing in earnings growth, with lower volatility and honoring our commitment to stockholder returns. Our unmatched execution, while being the lowest cost producer and ample liquidity, position us well to manage this pandemic induce low-margin environment and maintain our position of strength, as the global economy recovers. Lastly, the guiding principles underpinning our capital allocation strategy remain unchanged. There is absolutely no change in our strategy which prioritizes our investment grade ratings, sustaining investments and honoring the dividend. So with that, Homer I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks Joe. Before I provide our third quarter financial results summary, I'm pleased to inform you that we recently posted a Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB Report on our website that aligns with the SASB framework for refining and marketing industry standards. As you'll see in our report, we are targeting to reduce and offset greenhouse gas emissions by 63% by 2025, through investments in Board approved projects. The targets will be achieved through absolute emissions reductions through refining efficiencies, offsets by our ethanol and renewable diesel production and global blending and credits for renewable fuels. This is consistent with our strategy as we continue to leverage our global liquid fuels platform to expand our long-term competitive advantage with investments in economic low carbon projects. And, now turning to our quarterly performance, we incurred a net loss attributable to Valero stockholders of $464 million or $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020 compared to net income of $609 million or $1.48 per share for the third quarter of 2019. The third quarter 2020 adjusted net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $472 million or $1.16 per share compared to adjusted net income of $642 million or $1.55 per share for the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter 2020 adjusted results, primarily exclude the benefit from an after-tax lower of cost or market, or LCM, inventory valuation adjustment of approximately $250 million and an after-tax loss of $218 million for an expected LIFO liquidation. For a full reconciliation of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany the release. The refining segment reported an operating loss of $629 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to operating income of $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the LCM inventory valuation adjustment, the expected LIFO liquidation adjustment and other operating expenses, third quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss for the refining segment was $575 million. Third quarter 2020 results were impacted by narrow crude oil differentials, lower product demand and lower prices, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.5 million barrels per day, which was lower than the third quarter of 2019, due to lower product demand. Throughput capacity utilization was 80% in the third quarter of 2020. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.26 per barrel were $0.21 per barrel higher than the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to the effect of lower throughput rates. Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was $184 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $65 million in the third quarter of 2019. After adjusting for the retroactive Blender's Tax Credit, adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $123 million for the third quarter of 2019. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 870,000 gallons per day in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 232,000 gallons per day versus the third quarter of 2019, due to the effect of the planned maintenance that occurred during the third quarter of 2019. Operating income for the ethanol segment was $22 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to a $43 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2019. The third quarter 2020 adjusted operating income for the ethanol segment was $36 million. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.8 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2020, which was 206,000 gallons per day lower than the third quarter of 2019. The increase in operating income from the third quarter of 2019 was primarily due to higher margins resulting from lower corn prices. For the third quarter of 2020, G&A expenses were $186 million and net interest expense was $143 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $614 million and the income tax benefit was $337 million in the third quarter of 2020. The effective tax rate was 47%, which was primarily impacted by an expected U.S. federal tax net operating loss, that will be carried back to 2015, when the U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 35%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $165 million in the third quarter of 2020. Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of $246 million, as well as our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in its working capital, adjusted net cash used by operating activities was $177 million. With regard to investing activities, we made $517 million of total capital investments in the third quarter of 2020, of which $205 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and $312 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to our partners, 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $393 million. Moving to financing activities, we returned $399 million to our stockholders in the third quarter of 2020 through our dividend, resulting in a year-to-date total payout ratio of 165% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations for $15.2 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $4 billion. The debt to capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 36%. At the end of September, we had $5.8 billion of available liquidity excluding cash. Turning to guidance, we expect approximately $2 billion in capital investments attributable to Valero for 2020, about 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. We expect our annual capital investments for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion as well, and approximately 40% of our overall growth CapEx for 2020 and 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. For modeling, our fourth quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast, at 1.41 million to 1.46 million barrels per day, U.S. Mid-Continent at 385,000 barrels to 405,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 230,000 barrels to 250,000 barrels per day. And North Atlantic at 400,000 barrels to 420,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $4.35 per barrel. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2020, which reflects planned maintenance in October. Operating expenses in 2020 should be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.17 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4.2 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the fourth quarter net interest expense should be about $155 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $590 million. For 2020, we expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $775 million, which is $50 million lower than our prior guidance. And we expect the RINs expense for the year to be between $400 million and $500 million. Lastly, as discussed on our last earnings call, due to the impact of beneficial tax provisions in the CARES Act, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, we're not providing any guidance on our effective tax rate for 2020. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gresh : Just wanted to start-off by asking a bigger picture question around how Valero thinks about capacity management? Obviously recognizing Valero is at the low-end of the cost curve. The guidance here for 4Q and the results of past few quarters, you've had utilization in low '80s roughly. So I'm just curious how philosophically you think about managing capacity, whether it's from a temporary perspective or from a permanent perspective. Just what are the decision point to think about? Or is it more just managing, say secondary units, given the situation with diesel is more challenging than gasoline are, just any thoughts you'd have would be helpful. Thank you. Lane Riggs : All right. So, good morning Phil. This is Lane. I'll start by answering it with on a near-term, the way Valero looks out - and where we've been running our system is trying to optimize at a lower utilization nature that we have the - be very selective on the crudes we run and making sure we have the molecule where we want them. Certainly and it's a challenging time to do that. You just got to be very careful, we've seen our ability to flex our refinery yields quite a bit, that you can do a lot of that when your lower utilization we've seen move gasoline yield. So roughly 17% distillate yields up and down 10%, which is a little different than when you're full. So in the near-term, you just sort of trying to constantly optimize your operations, obviously to cash flow here. Longer-term, I've sort of spoken about this in earlier calls, when a company or Valero looks at an asset, from a deciding whether we run through or not it's largely driven by a change in trade flow which means - what I mean by that is - you see there is lots of crude advantage or something has changed its products fundamentally changes it's sort of, I would say, it's gross margin competitiveness and here is and combined with obviously a big regulatory spend or CapEx. Those are really the things that in terms of what drives I think, companies - and company like us another company it consider refinery closure. And so when you think about that criteria, where do you see that - you see that - in the U.S. it's on the West Coast, and the East Coast and you've seen companies like those decisions. And certainly, we've always felt like Europe, because you know, Europe - they're bringing all their crude oil in and they're kind of - a lot of their products have to export. And that's a tough situation, if you don't have a structural advantage on OpEx. And so that's sort of my answer on that. Phil Gresh : The second question would just be around the third quarter results themselves. Obviously, in the prepared remarks, Joe, you talked about tighter crude differentials as a factor that drove the sequential capture rate declines, particularly in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con. But I was just curious, are there any other say one-time factors in the quarter. I'm thinking perhaps, multiple hurricanes on the Gulf Coast as one that might have led to a more challenging performance versus what you would maybe ordinarily thought of? Joseph Gorder : Good question, Phil. Lane will take a crack at this and then, Gary, can follow on. Lane Riggs : Yes. So you're correct. Our Port Arthur refinery, we had to close [technical difficulty] and are really, really come back up was impeded by the utility provider got really hit hard us. So it\u2019s regional, sort of the utility provider and they had a difficult time providing power, they did a great job recovering, but ultimately that slowed our ability to bring the refinery back up. So we had some volume, where - how we would characterize the volume variance levels for those refinery. Gary Simmons : Yes, the only thing I'll add, as you know we provide ourselves a space in the U.S. Gulf Coast system on our ability to optimize and really well define a lot of these disadvantaged - discounted feed-stocks. And those opportunities, really just weren't there in the third quarter has certainly impacted our Gulf Coast operations. Phil Gresh : Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Manav Gupta : Joe, in your prepared remarks, you had indicated that the renewable diesel margin for the quarter was about $2.72. And in the last quarter this number was $2.22. So there was almost a $0.50 increase quarter-over-quarter. And when I look at the renewable diesel margin indicator you provide every week, which is very helpful. That was indicating a $0.01 improvement. So if you could help us sort of us out a little - as to how that $0.01 in indicator margin actually translated to over $0.50 in actual capture for the renewable diesel business segment? Joseph Gorder : Good morning Manav. Listen I'll let Mark can a crack on that one. Mark Schmeltekopf : So in the indicator margin as you know, as he says the gross margin, but it is a proxy for feedstock, we will use the soybean oil price and we're obviously not paying soybean oil price for feedstocks for our waste feedstocks. So that fluctuates quite a bit Manav. So that's the biggest reason, is the actual feedstock versus a soybean oil. Manav Gupta : Okay. And then quick follow-up is, I'm sure you have already secured the feedstocks for the St. Charles expansion. But again, there are a number of announcements out there. So are you in - already in the process of securing more feedstock for Port Arthur, if you could help us out there, a little? Joseph Gorder : Well, I think the backup, there is a lot of announcements out there and time will tell. If you look back historically, there's always been a lot of announcements and the announcements came and the projects never came, will it be different this time. It may be somewhat different. But you know, we're just confident in our ability to source waste feedstock going forward. Waste feedstock supply is tied to global GDP growth and our partnership with Darling, gives us the benefits of vertically integrated access to low cost, low carbon intensity feedstocks. We also get the benefit of Darling's experience in the global feedstock markets. Darling also helps us procure feedstocks from other people. So we just feel like we have a unique position here and that's going to allow us to maintain these superior margins versus the competition. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Theresa Chen : I guess a follow-up question on the renewable diesel front. And clearly the energy transition is a big theme along with ESG investing, happy to see the additional disclosures consistent with the SASB framework. Can you talk about how you view your renewable diesel position, as far as the defensibility of your projected return. How many of these projects that have been recently announced? Are you factoring in - as - once that could come to fruition. And also on the LCS prices as well. Do you see any risk there? Martin Parrish : Sure, I'll take a stab at that. This is Martin. Obviously we keep track of all the announced projects. We also keep track of all the new policies that are coming, and what we expect to come. And it's cloudy. I mean there is nothing but cloudy, in the farther you go out, the cloud you gets. You're making projections here. But if you just again step back and look at where we're at, a lot of these projects aren't going to get bill. That's just a fact. And you've got more policies coming. So right now, you've got California, you've got rid too in Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive and then you've got British Columbia and Ontario, those are in the major markets. While in the future, Oregon's ramping up. We're going to have a nationwide clean fuel standard in Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland, are being more aggressive, not huge demand there. But a huge percentage of renewable diesel. And you got the state of Washington, that keeps moving these steps forward, few steps back. And you've got Midwest states and Colorado, announcing policies too. And then the biggest one though is the New York, which the preliminary information they put out, has a lot of renewable diesel in the plant. So we really feel good about the demand. And then if you look at renewable diesel, just the molecule, right. It's available. It's a drop in fuel, it's low carbon intensity. There is no blend wall. So you have to think too, if you take California, they've hit the brakes a few times when - low carbon wasn't available right. They slowed down the program, if it is available. I would expect these regulators to hit the accelerator. So you know at the end of the day, all that being said, is there advantage demand of first mover. Yes, I would think so, and we're the first mover in the United States and we feel really good about our position and we feel really good about what we've laid out to do. Theresa Chen : Understood. And Joe related to your statements about the other low carbon growth projects under development. Can you give us a flavor of what kind of projects and this could pertain to? Are you talking about additional investment in biofuels and if it hydrogen related, any color that you can share there. Lane Riggs : Yes. This is Lane. So what we're really - what we're looking at right now is carbon sequestration projects largely and really trying to tie those two, the markets of - Mark was talking about. This is - where we think that we can make investments in lower our CIS of fuels and make them more competitive for these markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Brad Heffern : So you made a pretty clear from the remarks and the press release and your remarks on the call that there is no change to the capital framework or the dividend part, I think, you said in your prepared, even if this COVID weakness goes on for longer than expected. Can you just add a little more color around that. If we see four more quarters of less than minus $1 EPS, do you still see everything is being unchanged or what point do you have to re-evaluate, how you think about. Thanks. Joseph Gorder : Yes. Brad. That's a good question. Let me give - let Jason give you some insights here and then maybe I'll follow on. Jason Fraser : Yes, this is Jason. We basically feel we're a long way from rethinking the dividend. At the end of September, we all saw - we had a little over $4 billion in cash and about $5.7 billion of liquidity available under our committed facilities. We saw positive signs in the third quarter, demand improved, export volumes picked up. So we think things are headed in the right direction. It's just a question of how fast, in course of vaccine would really accelerate things alone. Looking bigger picture this pandemic is an isolated event. And we very reluctant to revise our long-term capital allocation framework that served us well for so many years. With our cash and liquidity position and the way things appear to be headed right now, this time we just don't think adjusting the dividend something a step we're going to need to take. Joseph Gorder : Yes, let me just add to this, I mean, there has been a lot of question out there, regarding the dividend. And I've been in this job a little over six years now. And we came out with the capital allocation framework and our approach to rewarding shareholders at that time. We have done nothing, every step of the way, but walk at top. And we've been very clear in our communications and we've demonstrated our commitment to our owners and we're going to continue to do that. I think one needs to decide when they're trying to determine who they're going to listen to and who really understands what's going on. There is going to be a management team and is demonstrated their commitment to their shareholders for six years or with somebody, who is taking a position from a basis of very little knowledge and trying to create opportunities for movement in the equity. And it certainly affects our long-term shareholders. So anyway I would, if I were you, I would encourage everybody to listen to us and listen to our messaging. And I think we've been pretty clear about at this time and I think Jason's answer was exactly right. Brad Heffern : And then maybe for Lane or Gary. Just on the West Coast, obviously, as part of the renewable diesel discussion, we've seen a couple of closures out there. I know historically you've thought about that market is sort of being an option value market for Valero. Do you think on the other side of - all this COVID stuff that it's potentially a stronger market that's less like option value or sort of how do you see that playing out? Lane Riggs : This is Lane. I would say, we're always going to manage it by being very careful what we've send out there. But we certainly, we believe ultimately the COVID will pass and gasoline and diesel demand will recover and you've changed the balances out there. So in the near term, it's an improved market for. So, while I think strategically we think we don't look at [technical difficulty] and take advantages of what - or at least in the near term, looks like a pretty good opportunity. Operator : Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Prashant Rao : My first one is on the balance sheet. Jason, I wanted to ask a couple of follow-ups here. Given the inventory adjustments, the LIFO liquidation and the liquidity management, you've done. I don't want kind of wanted to focus on balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents, you need to keep on hand for working cap in the current environment. Is that lower now going forward, I know, that we used to think about, it is sort of the slightly sub $2 billion bouquet for balance sheet cash but or the needs slightly lower, does that give you a little room under the caller, as we think about managing through the next couple of quarters into the recovery? Gary Simmons : We still target to be in that range. So - I think that's still a good assumption. Joe Gorder : Yes, clearly I think as we go forward, I mean one of the things that we did is took advantage of the opportunity in the market today to reassess it. And as Lane spoke about earlier, the supply chain has changed. And so the working capital, the inventory volumes essentially that we need are different than they were in the past. And so we took the P&L impact this year, but we run our business to - and we try to target proper operating levels for all of our inventories. And that's what guides us, it's not so much, jeez we need to take a LIFO impact or anything like that is more what - this proper operating level for our inventories and we adjusted to that. And so we've seen some benefit from the cash side. Prashant Rao : Okay, thank you, I'm sorry. Joseph Gorder : No, you're good. Go ahead. Prashant Rao : All right. Sorry, little bit static on the line here. I had another question on sort of the macro-specific on products on jet fuel. We're sort of trying to get our arms around what would happen on this with a slower jet demand recovery. What does that look like for a sort of refining margins and how does the system cope with that, if it takes a few more years to get back, let's say, in a bear case scenario the normal jet fuel demand. Can you maybe help us with some color on what that means for how you run your operations where you're sort of comfortable with jet fuel recovering to and maybe staying lower for longer, is it 70% of typical demand or 80% of typical demand. At what level, is it really not that much of a headwind, sort of - little bit of color on how to think about that and where we can think about you that stopping, pressuring distillate inventories not just in your system, but overall, globally? Joseph Gorder : Yes. So overall, I think you could see, we have full flexibility to pretty much not yield any jet and lend all of those molecules in ULSD and where it really does, it gets overall impact our refinery utilization. So the advantage of jet demand improving is that we can start to pull those molecules out and raise utilization along with it. I think, overall, we've been very surprised that the rate recovery of the jet markets, second quarter to third quarter was up 57% increase. And so far, the fourth quarter, the airline data - 15% to 17% increase in passenger headcount, which is encouraging. You know to - also go along with that, I would say, our nominations for the airlines it's - reserving are also up. The other thing you can start to see is jet, jet is now trading at a rate adjust petrodiesel maybe ULSD. I think that's the thing, that you'd like to see in the market is generating around - adjusted petrodiesel ULSD, which allows us to pull those molecules out of the diesel fuel and you will start to see that result in higher refinery utilization. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Doug Leggate : Let me just say, Joe, first of all. I for one and I think a lot of people appreciate you being as articulate and direct as you've been about the dividend question because of too much responsible investment analysis out there. And I think, you're right, people need to listen to you guys. So I appreciate you making that statement. With that, I've got two quick questions. First one is on debt tolerance, can you just talk about, you've added some debt, obviously as last quarter. You're positioned with plenty of liquidity. But what do you see as the debt tolerance? Your bonds are trading just fine it seems. If you needed to what do you think about the balance sheet here. Joseph Gorder : Yes, I mean, you're right. The bonds are trading well. We've got a lot of cash given the steps we've taken, we still have our $5.7 billion of untapped liquidity, which we could rely on is, if we needed to - we don't expect the need more liquidity and I'm sure we could. There are other things we could do if we needed to. We feel like we're in a pretty good spot. Lane Riggs : Yes, I think, Joe lot of the business, Jason mentioned earlier, I think that you finance the business, when it's attractive to do that and there is no sense of adding any degree of risk to - for the operation. And so just it's debt. I was very impressed with the rates we got, the demand was very high for the offerings and we remain committed to the investment grade rating. No question about it. But we think, there is room if we needed to do something else. There is room to do more, we don't anticipate that we're going to need to do more, but we certainly believe we could, if we needed to, we do great. Yes, So, - answers that question, Doug? Doug Leggate : Yes, it does. Thank you. And my follow-up is really more of a housekeeping issue, maybe I missed some subtlety in prior calls, I don't know. But in your last presentation, you still have the non-discretionary spending at our - run about $1.5 billion. Your guidance today says a couple of billion 2021 and the sustaining capital is 60% and that's obviously $1.2 billion. Is that just a low point? Is it sustainable at that level or is something changed, that has reset your sustaining capital. And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Lane Riggs : Thanks, Doug. Sorry, Doug, This is Lane. So it's that - that's on the lower side and when we talk about our spend or sustaining Capital. We're really talking about, is over three or four-year cycle. That's roughly the average that we feel like we need to spin. We have heavy turnaround years and lighter turnaround years. So you have to remember in that $1.5 billion is - our turnaround activity. So that's - I'll leave it with that. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Please proceed with your question. Paul Sankey : Doug, kind of hit on what I wanted to hits on. So because the question really being the extent to which CapEx is flexible, I think you answered very well. Separately, could you talk about, just give us the latest update and I know it's a difficult question on the election and what do you think the top risks that you faced from the potential outcomes hopefully abide and when, what are the biggest concerns and do you think overblown concerns about a potential for example democrats suit. Thank you. Rich Lashway : So, this is Rich. I'll talk a step trying to answer this. I mean, I think, if you look at this, we have a Democratic win directionally, they're going to, they're probably going to want to look at higher taxes and probably more regulation. But regardless of who win, you're coming out of the pandemic here. So you've got a first priority, which is high unemployment rate, you need to stimulate the economy, the focus is going to be on those kinds of things and it's really hard to layer on a whole bunch of policies that with some other an effort to recover. So I think. I think what you going to see is a lot of campaign rhetoric right now. And then you're going to see a lot of that have to run into the wall of reality once they get through the election. The other part of it is, if you just look at Biden and his history. He is not you know, one of these real ideologically driven individuals. He saw a long history of being supportive of manufacturing and supportive of union jobs and those facilities. And so he spoken positively also about the renewable industry. So we - because you'll be supportive in that area as well. So we - it's never, it's never as bad as I say, it's going to be in and it's never as good as I say is going to be. And so I think there's a lot of institutional and structural reasons why these changes will not be as good coming in and some people think. And so we feel pretty good. We think there is going to be demand recovery here, as we go through the economy. And we don't think that the administration we are doing anything that's going to really materially alter that. Joseph Gorder : Yes, the one thing I think that we see Paul is - there is a kind of stimulus package following the election. It doesn't matter which part you get selected is Rich referred to. They're going to have to get the economy rolling. And so I would say it is rolling off, but there is. Our view is there is going to be some kind of stimulus package. And any type of stimulus package. Just going to trigger greater demand for products that we produce. And so we're - all over watching it carefully and we'll - we are well positioned and organized company to deal with whatever comes, I think, we're not as pessimistic as many are about the potential outcome for a change of administration. Paul Sankey : Great, thanks. And I'd like the wall of reality comfort. Thank you. The follow-up. Joseph Gorder : That's what we try to live Paul. Paul Sankey : Joe, the follow-up is, there's a lot to talk about further to stimulus about bailout for airlines sort of stuff. Can you just remind us how to what extent you've been helped out by federal government programs if any. Thank you. Jason Fraser : What I'm trying to think, I mean, Jason Fraser : Yes, I mean, I think there are substantial efforts here to pop-up the airlines and provide them with protections and we think any of the bills that are coming through, you're likely to see more support for the airline industry and obviously supporting them helps reinforce the demand for jet. So I think, that's where we would think we would benefit from that. I think that\u2026 Paul Sankey : So obviously your response implies that Valero has not received much? Joseph Gorder : No, no. Paul Sankey : Yes, I just wanted to clarify that. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Roger Read : Lot of the stuff has been hit. I guess maybe if we could go back and address a little bit kind of the issue with the way the industry is losing money hand over fist at the current environment. And that's likely to continue at least a little bit longer. What do you see, even if you don't want to name any particular company or particular unit that would be at risk. I know, you've talked about the regions. But what are the kind of things that we should pay attention to you from the outside that would indicate someone that made the decision to shut a unit, if not absolutely permanently at least for the foreseeable future. I mean, everybody is losing cash. But is it a crude supply changes, it is a demand concern, is it, I think, the high maintenance costs in the very near term then cited previous times. Just anything else I suppose that questions for you Lane but whoever wants to jump in there. Lane Riggs : Now, after the practice of losing money hand over - I kind of spoke earlier about the change in trade flow. And what I really mean by that is, you can really see that in some of those place or maybe product demand is falling. And they don't have a crude advantage. So that's obviously a part of it. I think. - and then I have talk about regulatory spend. The other spend they can have is [technical difficulty] a large turnaround like I don't want to say, it probably it's like an FCC sort of base turnaround, where you have the FCC and those end up very large. And that - well, that might be of companies that maybe have stretched balance sheet or are struggling and you had layer on of these other issues and based on their location that might factor into some of the companies, thinking about whether they either just sort of shut part of a refinery down or maybe consider something [technical difficulty]. Roger Read : Yes, certainly going to be sort of an interesting - will continue to be interesting. I guess one on last questions, and so much of it has been on the negative front, lot of stress in the system. A lot of questions about longer-term viability of fuel demand. But if you were believing in the long-term success of refining, are there or would you expect any interesting opportunities to come along, particularly in the areas that you already operate in where you could, really get some synergies built in there. So kind of the M&A wish list question, so to speak. Joseph Gorder : Yes, let me just start and then we'll see Rich wants to add anything to this. But certainly, we do believe in the long-term viability of refining. I mean, it is totally impractical to think that we would live in a world over, certainly I would guess my lifetime. Because I know this is more than the couple of years, we\u2019re losing money hand over fit. In my lifetime where we're going to be able to displace fuels, motor fuels, liquid fuels that are produced from fossil fuels. I mean it's just, it is part of what is necessary to makes the world function that we live it. And so anyway, we are believers in the long-term viability of refining. Cleaner fuels will be a part of it. We're obviously making investments to take care of that. But we do believe that our refining business is going to continue to be strong and successful going forward. So, Rich, anything on the M&A front. Rich Lashway : No there's really, nothing to say other than it's hard to justify any kind of an acquisition given that we're preserving cash, and we've got a queue of good organic projects that we've kind of can push back. So in - we're not buying back shares. So in this environment, it's really difficult to see any kind of M&A activity. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Paul Cheng : Two question one. It is for Jason, and I think that we're strict forward. One maybe longer term. For Jason, have you received any cash tax refund, given your loss, and if you are - what is your expectation that - what percentage of - if the tax loss, reported tax loss in the next 12 months to 18 months and what percentage you would be able to receive as cash tax refund. The second, should I also tell you guys, my second question or should I wait until Jason answer that first? Joseph Gorder : Paul do you mind repeating the question real quick. It is tough to hear you. Paul Cheng : The first question is on the cash tax refund. You guys receiving any given the tax law and you have tax loss carry-forward, maybe back into 2015, when you are making money. And if you are receiving cash tax refund from the government. Over the next 12 months, let's assume if you're still reporting loss, what percentage of that tax benefit would we actually we see it as a cash tax refund. Joseph Gorder : Okay. So the first part of it is NOL right - was the value of NOL to\u2026 Lane Riggs : We expect to get it in second quarter. We expect to receive cash related to the refund. Paul Cheng : Jason you said, always that the second quarter for the previous year. Jason Fraser : Yes, yes. Paul Cheng : So - so in other words that 2021, if you have a loss those cash tax refund, we will receive in 2022. Any idea on the 100% dollar to dollar, or that is a percentage. Jason Fraser : No, to be clear. And this is Mark. The tax loss that we're incurring, this year - we received the tax refund in April of next year. So that has nothing to do with what our results might be in 2021. Paul Cheng : I understand, I understand. So I'm saying that we - if you have your - in your book, if you report your tax and let's say for this year, argument they did, $300 million. If the entire $300 million you expect to receive that cash or that is only a portion of that? Mark Schmeltekopf : Well, I'm not sure I really totally understand your question. But if you look at the effective tax rate that we're running that would probably give you a good idea of what the refund would be next year. Paul Cheng : My second question is that Joe and Lane, if we look at the regulatory environment in Europe and in California, in both areas that the government is trying to detect their current law, saying that they will ban the sale of the hydrocarbon or to the gasoline or even diesel hydrocarbon base vehicle by 2035 or so. How that impacts your outlook on your game plan for the facilities in those areas. And - also that on long that way. Some of your bigger customers has been talking about energy transition plan. Do you think that is something for level need to have a plan. Joseph Gorder : Okay. So we'll take the first part first, you want to go. Lane Riggs : Yes, I'll take the first part. So it's obviously still early, trade flows on regulatory environment, can drive some - how you think about assets, I think, the one thing I would [technical difficulty] government's intensions and plans and targets, we live in the aspirational world as the tendency to put. And lot of markets that are trying to do that or regulators that are trying to do to - their tenancies to put a goal out there, but the feasibility of the goals has a tenancy to push the goal out. I don't necessarily think that either California or the U.K. or Europe, you're going to have zero fossil fuels, gasoline transportation going for. Now with that said, there is what they're trying to do. And so ultimately, as I said earlier, what are we doing in West Coast, what are - number of very, very careful in the CapEx that we - how we run and we're very careful and trying to manage the cost of those refineries, whether it's through our regime, cost or current [technical difficulty] very careful. Joseph Gorder : And you know, Paul, on the question of the future and positioning the company strategically for the future. We continue to work on that. And obviously, I think we've been a leader on several fronts. We were early to get into the ethanol business. Now we're looking at ways to lower the carbon footprint of the ethanol that we produce in - on market that into the market seeking, and rewarding lower carbon fuels. And the renewable diesel business is another example of that. We will continue to evolve the portfolio based on what the market is calling for and using the strong refining base that we've got, is a basis for the cash flow to do this kind of transition. But you know, and we can, I think we put out our documents now, what our targets are for further reductions over the - which now 2025 with already - projects are already approved by the Board. So we're clearly working this direction. We don't have our heads buried in sand on that front by any stretch. And will position Valero to be very successful for a very long time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Todd : Maybe a follow-up on some of the conversations from earlier on the renewable diesel side. You talked about some of the advantages, obviously that the Darling partnership fossil on the feedstock side. Can you say - as you think about your expansions of the one coming in 2021, the possible one for 2024. Can you talk a little bit more about how you see those, being positioned on things like how do you compare transport cost in terms of transporting - product to California versus operational cost of running a plant like that in Louisiana or Texas as opposed to California. How do the relative economics, do you see those in terms of competitive positioning. Martin Parrish : Sure, this is Martin. Well, we would just flat I would say, we feel like to get Gulf Coast is the best place to be. It's lower capital cost to build, it's lower operating cost. And then also when you think about just the logistics, the rail infrastructure getting into the Gulf Coast from wireless, you've going to source of feedstocks as great. And then the logistics getting out. We don't know, where the highest-priced market is going to be in the future and it's going to move. So whether we're going to California, Canada, Europe somewhere else. We just - the Gulf Coast is just have to be. We've been at the seven years now and what we always try to do is to build the advantaged, low OpEx and high flexibility plants. And what we've learned is that you need to co-locate with the large operating refinery. It needs to be an operating refinery and by doing that reduce this cost. And again I can't stress the logistics enough that we just have a huge advantage there and we intend to keep that. But been in the Gulf Coast. Ryan Todd : And then maybe just a follow-up on the macro side on refining. I mean, third quarter differentials, where a large headwind. I mean, even more so on the spend in the second quarter. And particularly, sweat and sour differentials have been tough. I mean, is there a scenario on which the outlook for sweet tower or crude differentials in general improve meaningfully, without a meaningful recovery in oil demand or absolute prices from here. How do you think about just if you look forward over the next six months to 12 months. Gary Simmons : Yes. So, this is Gary. Certainly, we saw very, very narrow crude quality differentials in third quarter. Some of that - lot of balancing in the market came from those production. We got some of that production back in August. Additionally, they had the storms that affected the Gulf of Mexico, leads our production. So getting some of that production online is held. And so you've seen the ASCI differential, kind of move out a little bit wider so far. You - in fourth quarter Amaya's tended to follow it. But we believe, you know, it really needs to have that - is as global continues to improve a greater percentage of that will be incrementally build from OPEC production sour barrels. And so you will have more of a gradual recovery in all the differentials it go along with that. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Gabelman : So I wanted to ask about the investment grade rating and kind of the metrics that are critical for determining that - the cap is over 30%. So I'm assuming that's now what's really driving the conversation between Valero and the credit rating companies. So when we're trying to assess kind of your targets for the balance sheet, what are the right credit metrics to kind of look at outside of that the cap? Jason Fraser : Yes, this is Jason. I can talk a little bit about that. As you know, our investment grade ratings are key top priority for us and we've discussed this with the rating agencies. We have excellent liquidity, which is really whether most key factors for them. They also right through the cycle for the long term, right. They're not just like the next 6-months and 12-months. And need to clearly recognize our strengths. Longer term if you read their reports, talk about our excellent facility, top operators. So I don't think there is any concerns on their part with us being investment grade. It also, the way we structured our debt. You will notice that at least our most recent offering, the big one was biased towards the shorter term. And we did that intentionally, we have a lot of maturities in '23, '24, '25, '27 and we have the ability to call the $575 million tranche through your floaters as early as next fall. We did have to give us the flexibility to deleverage more quickly, in all circumstances right. And the ratios we looked at, they looked at each agency looks at all the ratios, but they have their own ones or ones if they are highlight the most are versions of debt-to-EBITDA and retained cash flow. And those type of things and then net cash flow. I mean, net debt to cap. But they look at kind of the same things but we don't think we're at all at risk for investment-grade rating. And we did get put on negative outlook, when we did this last offering rating. And I could tell you a little bit at least about what, the way I think they were thinking about that. So each of them does our own analysis and has their own separate view. But really think that outlook change was mainly driven by the change in expectations for the timing of the recovery versus the assumptions that were made, when they last looked at us back in April. The deal in April was, if this would be a one to two quarter event with pretty full earnings recovery in the fourth quarter. That's what we were looking at. I think that was their view too. But there - that was before the summer infection spikes hit and things clearly going to take more than getting back to absolute normal in the fourth quarter. And we really think that view - that there is going to be delayed recovery, along with our new debt which will then will all lead to a longer period with elevated credit ratios. And that's really what the negative outlook reflects. They look out the next 12 months and are you going to have a higher ratios and what they like new regular baseline. And the answer is yes. And that is true. But it would - doesn't affect their view of us as an investment grade credit longer term. Jason Gabelman : Great. That's really clear. So they're thinking about or recovery when they're assessing the rating in 2022-ish? Jason Fraser : Yes. That's right. I think, I can't remember exactly they stated in their reports. What I was thinking second half of next year. And they admit that they think Valero's thinks is going to happen more quickly and all the - what I don't think was as clear. But I think the next 12 to 18 months, generally. Jason Gabelman : Okay, great. And then I want to ask a follow-up on Lane's comment on carbon sequestration, which I think you mentioned was one of the low carbon investment opportunities. What's the economic case for that is that driven by the U.S. tax credits offered or is there something else driving the potential to generate returns from investing in that. And then on the topic, I'm surprised that hydrogen was I mentioned just given that there is a lot of interest globally in investing in the hydrogen value chain and refineries produce a lot of hydrogen already. So just wondering, any thoughts on that. Thanks. Lane Riggs : Well, this is Lane. So I'll add to that - I'm sure some other people might want to well. So when we're looking at these projects - our first filter our first where we think about from developing them. It does improve our carbon intensity as Philadelphia at those market that's where we see the higher value per [technical difficulty] and we can get the biggest bang for our buck. And then we for a stress test, with the U.S. tax credit and trying to understand what that looks like as well. So that's how are developing and looking at these types of projects. On the hydrogen, we're just - we're starting to look at some of those things. Again, we're looking at in the context of some of our existing hydrogen plants and their technology and we have the ability to obviously get the carbon dioxide out of those streams to lower their intensity, not so almost trying to make hydrogen for fuel cells. Joseph Gorder : Yes. There's a lot of things like that - that you take a look at. But at the end of the day, the economics just don't work and like the 45 tax credit. It is a key one, when you looking at the sequestration going forward, where day looks like you can or return on some of these projects into it LCFS market, as Lane said borrowing that a lot of these projects just don't have economics. And so that's why it's interesting to talk about it. It's like the topic du jour but is there - are these feasible enough that's one of things if we look at. And we're certainly not fair to announce that these step that direction is disappoint. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Bhullar for any additional closing comments. Homer Bhullar : Great, thank you and thank you everyone for joining us. Appreciate everyone's questions. Unfortunately, we're out of time. So if you have follow-up questions feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. We thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a remainder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the Company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact on families, communities, and businesses across the globe. The energy business was among those confronted by unprecedented demand contraction, which began in the first quarter of 2020 as COVID-19 cases accelerated globally, resulting in an increase in crude oil and product inventories to record high levels. In response, we lowered our refinery utilization rates to more closely match product supply with demand. And as the pandemic-related restrictions were eased in some regions and mobility increased, product demand increased substantially, steadily reducing crude oil and product inventories. We ended the year with U.S. crude oil and product inventories within the normal five-year inventory band. Throughout the pandemic, our team has been thorough and decisive in its operational and financial response, while maintaining focus on safety and reliability. In fact, we set several operational records in 2020, recording our best ever year on employee safety performance, achieving the milestone two years in a row, and the best ever year for process safety and environmental performance. And applying our refining expertise to optimize our renewable diesel segment, we set records for sales volumes and margin in 2020. We also made significant progress on our international strategy to expand our product supply chain into higher-growth markets with the start of waterborne product shipments to our new Veracruz terminal, making Valero one of the largest fuel importers into Mexico. On the financial side, we improved our liquidity by raising $4 billion of debt at attractive rates, and we reduced our capital budget by over $500 million, while keeping our high-return projects moving forward. And in spite of all the challenges this past year, we continued to honor our commitment to our shareholders by maintaining the dividend and ending the year with $3.3 billion of cash and $9.2 billion of total available liquidity. Despite the pandemic imposed challenges and several hurricanes, we completed and continued to make progress on several strategic growth projects, including the St. Charles Alkylation unit, which was brought on line in the fourth quarter, on schedule and under budget. The project further increases the competitiveness of the St. Charles refinery and is a testament to the talent and efforts as a refining organization. The Pembroke Cogen project and the Diamond Pipeline expansion are on track to be completed in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. And the Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in 2023.The Diamond Green Diesel expansion project at St. Charles, which we refer to as DGD 2 is designed to increase renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a result of continuous process improvement and optimization, the capacity of the existing St. Charles renewable diesel plant, DGD 1, has increased from 275 million gallons per year to 290 million gallons per year. With the completion of DGD 2, the total capacity at St. Charles is expected to be 690 million gallons per year. In 2020, we laid out our comprehensive roadmap to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 63% by 2025. As part of this goal, we continue to reinvest capital into higher growth, higher return, low-carbon renewable fuels projects. To that end, we're pleased to announce that the Board has approved DGD 3, a new 470 million gallons per year renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur, Texas refinery. We're moving forward with the project immediately, and we now expect the new plant to be operational in the second-half of 2023. Once DGD 3 is completed, DGD\u2019s combined annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. Looking ahead, we expect to see continued improvement in refining margins, as COVID-19 vaccines are widely distributed in the coming months, allowing people and businesses to get back to normalcy. We're already seeing encouraging signs with strong diesel demand and with U.S. total light product inventories now in the normal range. In addition, many uncompetitive refineries around the world announced shutdowns or conversions in 2020, and we expect further capacity rationalizations to be announced this year. In closing, we remain steadfast in the execution of our strategy, pursuing excellence in operations, investing for earnings growth with lower volatility and honoring our commitment to stockholder returns. We expect low-carbon fuel policies to continue to expand globally and drive demand for renewable fuels. And with that view, we're leveraging our global liquid fuels platform and expertise that comes with being the largest renewable diesel producer in North America to steadily expand our competitive advantage and economic low-carbon projects for a higher return on invested capital. So, with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we incurred a net loss attributable to Valero stockholders of $359 million, or $0.88 per share compared to net income of $1.1 billion, or $2.58 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019. The fourth quarter 2020 adjusted net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $429 million, or $1.06 per share compared to adjusted net income of $873 million, or $2.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019. For 2020, the net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.4 billion, or $3.50 per share compared to net income of $2.4 billion, or $5.84 per share in 2019. The 2020 adjusted net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.3 billion, or $3.12 per share compared to adjusted net income of $2.4 billion, or $5.70 per share in 2019. Fourth quarter and full-year 2019 and 2020 adjusted results exclude items reflected in the financial tables that accompany the earnings release. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to those financial tables. The refining segment reported an operating loss of $377 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to operating income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the LIFO liquidation adjustment and other operating expenses, the fourth quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss for the refining segment was $476 million. Fourth quarter 2020 results were impacted by narrow crude oil differentials, lower product demand and lower prices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Refining throughput volumes averaged $2.6 million barrels per day, which was lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 due to lower product demand. Throughput capacity utilization was 81% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.40 per barrel were in line with guidance with $0.47 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the effect of lower throughput rates. Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was $127 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $541 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. After adjusting for the retroactive blender's tax credit in 2019, adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $187 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 618,000 gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of 226,000 gallons per day versus the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the effect of planned maintenance. The segment set annual records for sales volumes of 787,000 gallons per day and margin of $2.66 per gallon. Operating income for the ethanol segment was $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.1 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was 197,000 gallons per day lower than the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease in operating income from the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower margins, resulting from higher corn prices and lower ethanol prices. For the fourth quarter of 2020, G&A expenses were $224 million and net interest expense was $153 million. G&A expenses in 2020 of $756 million were $112 million lower than 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $577 million and income tax benefit was $289 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The annual effective of tax rate was 45% for 2020, which was primarily the result of the carryback of our U.S. federal tax net operating loss to 2015 when the statutory tax rate was 35%. And we expect to receive a cash tax refund of approximately $1 billion in the second quarter of this year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding the unfavorable impact from the changes in working capital of $113 million and our joint venture partner\u2019s 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $140 million, and adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $955 million for the full year. With regard to investing activities, we made $622 million of total capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2020, of which $214 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts, and regulatory compliance, and $408 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner\u2019s 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $458 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $2 billion for the full year. Moving to financing activities, we returned $400 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2022 through our dividend and $1.8 billion through dividends and buybacks in the year, resulting in a total 2020 payout ratio of 184% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. And our Board of Directors just approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share, demonstrating our strong financial position and commitment to return cash to our investors. With regard to our balance sheet at quarter-end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $3.3 billion. The debt to capitalization ratio net of cash and cash equivalents was 37%. And at the end of December, we had $5.9 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance, we expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. Almost half of our growth CapEx in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges, Gulf Coast at 1.49 million to 1.54 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 170,000 to 190,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.75 per barrel, which is impacted by lower throughput volumes due to planned maintenance activity. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 790,000 gallons per day in 2021. Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 3.7 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for noncash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $155 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $575 million. For 2021, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $850 million, and the annual effective tax rate should approximate the U.S. statutory rate. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. And please respect this request to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Doug Terreson : Good morning, everybody. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson : Regarding refining fundamentals, Joe, you mentioned a minute ago that inventories are starting to shape up a little bit in close to five-year levels, I think on an absolute basis, but they look like they're going to the same range adjusted for demand for both gasoline and distillate, which is a good thing. Margins are near year-ago levels in most U.S. markets, and we're starting to see feedstock differentials widen, too. So, my question is, have you been surprised by the pace of the recovery that we've seen? Do you think there is reason to believe that it's sustainable? And either way, what's your overall view for the recovery in refined products market for 2021? What's your outlook at this point? Joe Gorder : Doug, that's a good question. We'll let Gary and Lane speak to it in some detail. But, I mean, we've been pleased with the pace of the recovery so far. And frankly, I think, you're going to see it accelerate as the vaccine rolls out more aggressively. That's kind of an obvious statement. But, I think, sometimes we do take it for granted. If we can really get the government functioning appropriately on the distribution, I think, we're going to be in much better shape, perhaps quicker than we all realized. And we've got a member of our Board of Directors, who thinks that there is such pent-up demand, certainly in the East Coast where he is and other parts of the country, that when we do get the vaccine rolled out, we get a herd immunity in place, you're going to see this look a little bit like the roaring 1920s, and that's his point of view. And I would tend to agree with that. So, with that, I'll let Gary and Lane provide a little more color specifically regarding the inventories and demand. Gary Simmons : Yes, Doug. This is Gary. Certainly, getting total light product inventory, we built a significant surplus, especially early on in the pandemic. So, seeing that surplus essentially gone and getting back into the five-year average range is very encouraging. As you know, as demand starts to pick up, it will allow margins to recover much quicker. I think, encouraging -- another encouraging sign is the fact, despite the fact that we've had a surge in COVID cases, gasoline demand for the DOE is still a little bit above 90% year-over-year where it was last year at this time. Our wholesale volumes are showing to be pretty close to that. And so, the combination of reasonable gasoline demand and relatively low gasoline inventories has caused the prop market to be a little stronger. I think, one of the key things there is the stronger prop market has really flattened the curve on gasoline. And so, it's taking away a lot of that incentive to store summer grade gasoline, and that certainly sets up for a stronger driving season in terms of gasoline margins. As Joe said, I think, we view that we'll see gradual recovery. Second quarter, you'll start to see things pick up. And then we expect things to be fairly normal by the third quarter, with the exception that we do see that there could be a lot of pent-up demand, and people that are spending disposable income largely buying things that they're ordering are going to spend that disposable income getting out and on experiences, family vacations, which could cause a surge in gasoline demand. On the diesel side, as you kind of mentioned, diesel demand is really hung in there pretty strong. So, DOEs are showing over 98% year-over-year diesel demand. Actually, at the seven-day average in our system, we were at 111% year-over-year, so actually showing diesel demand growth in our system. I think some of that heating oil demand has been strong, a little bit colder winter this year, starting to see some drilling activity pick up, which, of course, helps diesel demand. And then, of course, with people spending disposable income ordering things, freight -- on-road freight, trucking and rail has been strong as well. As we move throughout the year, we expect to see some incremental diesel demand coming from ag, as you start to plant crops. And then, moving throughout the year, we also see that as jet demand begins to recover, it will lower diesel yields and help bring supply and demand into balance, which will set diesel up nicely longer-term. Doug Terreson : Okay. Good points. So, that kind of covers it for me. It sounds fairly encouraging. Joe Gorder : Yes. Doug, I mean, look, we are encouraged. I mean, I think we're through the worst of this. And we're looking forward to getting back to more normal lifestyles here and certainly a more normal business climate. But, let me just say one thing before you get off. I understand that you're going to be repositioning this spring. And we've known each other for a very long time. And I'd be remiss if I just didn't say that without question, your wisdom and insight in this sector is unsurpassed. But more importantly than that, Doug, you're a very good man, and we're all better people for having had the opportunity to get to know you and to work with you over the years. And I, for one, am going to miss you greatly. So, I know we're going to have a chance to visit here sometime in March. But look, I just want to -- on behalf of the whole Valero team, I think, we just want to wish you the best and tell you thanks for everything you've done for the industry over the years. Doug Terreson : Well, Joe, thank you, too. I mean, you guys have been capital management leaders, especially in this industry. Your stock reflects it over time, and you all are good guys, too. And so, you've been a really easy management team for me to support over the decades. And I just want to thank you for your leadership and really enjoyed our time together. And so, you guys pat yourselves on the back because you deserve the performance that has been demonstrated in the stock market for sure. Thanks again, Joe. Joe Gorder : Yes. Bless you, buddy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gresh : Hey. Good morning. Tough follow-up. Joe Gorder : Well, Phil, you're still a young guy. You'll get yours one day, but it probably won't be from me. Phil Gresh : I guess, I'll follow-up on one part of Doug's question there, just on the differential side. You talked a lot about the product margin element, differential is obviously still pretty tight here, especially like on light-heavy. So, how do you guys see that playing out for the rest of the year? Gary Simmons : Yes. Phil, this is Gary. I think, we have seen very narrow crude quality differentials. In order to get those widened out, we need more OPEC barrels on the market. If you look at most consulting forecast, they're showing global oil demand growing to the point where you'll need at least 3 million barrels a day of additional OPEC production online by the end of the year. And so, I think, our view is probably the back half of the year is where you'll see quality differentials begin to widen out. I think, that's further supported by, if you look at the high sulfur fuel oil forward curve, where high sulfur fuel have been trading around 90% of Brent, you look to the back half of the year, and it gets more to 80% of Brent, which is more indicative that we'll see those quality differentials widen out again kind of the second-half of the year. Phil Gresh : Got it. Okay. And then, the second question, just trying to think through the capital spending cadence over these next few years with Phase 3 of Diamond Green Diesel. Obviously, you talked about a $2 billion spending level for 2021 being able to hold, despite still some spending for Phase 2. So, as you look out to 2022 and 2023, do you think you can do the Phase 3 project within the $2 billion or so capital budget as well? I'm just trying to gauge the free cash flow potential as we see the refining margins recover and DGD EBITDA come on? Lane Riggs : Hey Phil, this is Lane. So, we did about $2 billion last year, actually a little bit less than that. We maintained our pace on spending on Diamond 2 and developing Diamond 3. And we believe that we can continue to do that if for whatever reason, the world's -- the cash is a little bit lower. Obviously, we want to get back to some other things at some point, but we can certainly maintain our spend on renewable diesel with our capital budget at a $2 billion level. Joe Gorder : Yes. And Phil, just -- I mean, from a broader strategic perspective, this 2 to $2 billion number is our target going forward, okay? I don't think you should expect that we're going to go out and spend $3 billion in a year. So, we've said that timing of capital spend isn't necessarily calendar year spending. And so, some years, it might be less than $2 billion as it was this year and some years, it's going to be a little bit more than $2 billion. But, the target range for us remains in that $2 billion to $2.5 billion range, and I think, it will stay in this $2 billion range through 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Prashant Rao with Citi. Prashant Rao : I just wanted to follow-up on the RD market and its evolution, particularly outside of BTC, outside of the 4 RINs, which I expect other people are going to ask about. But, I'm curious about the LCFS market in California and some of the other provincial and regional opportunities that we've talked about. I wanted to get your thoughts specifically in California. It seems like there's a lot competing sources of capital. This pandemic has progressed capital towards sort of emerging energy. And while they're small now, there is a possibility for a little bit more electrification, more renewable gas, the other competing sources for that credit, or for diesel substitutes in California. I was just wondering, given the supply coming on line with Port Arthur and your longer term plans, how do you see that playing out in California? Is it fair to say that by the time DGD 3 is up on line, there might be a more meaningful opportunity outside of the California LCFS? And, how do you see the pace of that over the next few years? The other part of that also being, do you expect that California could reduce -- they could increase the emissions reduction target, which would just move the goalpost and create a greater opportunity? So, there is a lot of pieces moving there, but the market's changed quite a bit since we were talking about this pre-COVID. So, I just wanted to get an update on how you see those moving parts playing out? Martin Parrish : Sure. Prashant, this is Martin. On California, obviously, the market\u2019s been pretty stable as far as the carbon price the last few years. And then, the renewable diesel is the largest carbon generator. You step outside California, I'll answer that part first. What we expect to happen in the next few years is the clean fuel standard to be in place in Canada by the end of 2022. That will bring incremental demand in 2023. We've also got legislation in New York State and Washington State for LCFS programs. We think those states will implement an LCFS over the next few years. Timing of that is hard or impossible to predict, but we expect that's going to happen. Today, we sell to California, but we also sell to Canada and Europe. So, I mean, you're right. There's some electricity penetration, there's renewable natural gas, but still renewable diesel is the largest carbon credit generator. We don't expect that to change in the foreseeable future. And as far as the trucking, that's going to continue. Renewable diesel obviously is huge in that. California, if you look at their projections, they're heading for 2030, their internal projections are like a 40% blend rate for renewable diesel. We honestly think it might even be higher than that. So, there's really -- there's no blend wall. There's nothing to stop this. So, we're optimistic about demand in California, and we're optimistic about demand in other parts of the globe. Prashant Rao : And then, just a follow-up on that. Recently, we've been hearing in the headlines, there's been some in the financial community who talk about, who have been saying advocating for a need for a higher carbon price in order to incentivize the move to emissions reduction. And obviously, California has had a higher per ton price than other parts of the developed world. But, do you think that -- is it too early to say that there is some maybe -- that gives the $200 per ton carbon price in California, a little bit more legs to be sustainable as the rest of the world is going to come up, or do you see sort of the meeting in the middle? How do you see that evolving, given where the narrative and where the discussion is right now? Martin Parrish : Yes. I'd say, first thing, you have to be a little careful looking at the absolute price because it depends on whether it's a low-carbon fuel standard or a carbon tax, you get to a lot different carbon prices in those different regimes. But I think with California, they've obviously signaled, they're okay with $200, and they're okay with that escalated by the CPI each year. If things happen where that price started going down, I would expect California to move the goalpost and make it harder. We're looking at a carbon reduction at 20% by 2030 now. But, if you start having the carbon price go down, a lot of credits, I think, they're going to move the goalposts, because that's the objective, right? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Manav Gupta : In the energy industry, what you generally see is projects getting delayed by 6 months or 12 months, you're doing something unique, DGD is starting up 6 months before expectations. Just trying to understand from the perspective of engineering, feedstock securement, how are you able to achieve a start-up before time, in this case? Lane Riggs : Manav, this is Lane. So, we obviously are very, very focused on this project, and we did accelerate because if you look at our spend, we spent more than we actually budgeted to try to keep -- to try to -- as we are executing that project to find every step we can optimize and accelerate the schedule and not do so by accelerating the cost of the project either. So, as you've mentioned, we are -- we have worked it really, really hard because it is such a good project, and it is a big cash flow generator for us. So, it's really we have expertise in terms of project execution, we understand. And Diamond 3 is essentially a duplicate of Diamond 2 and with a few revisions here and there, but it's largely -- so we've been able to accelerate that project as well. And we just -- because of our focus, we put our best people on making sure that project moves along as fast as it can. Manav Gupta : A quick follow-up here is, obviously, wind prices have moved up. I'm trying to understand how the start-up of DGD 2 and then following up DGD 3 actually cut your RVO obligation, which would give us some idea what the RVO obligation is right now? And then, how much lower does it go once both the DGD phases are on line? Joe Gorder : Sorry. We're looking, Manav, to see if Martin or Gary... Martin Parrish : I think, what you have to think about there, Manav, is you've got the obligation but you've got a lot of factors right now. And RIN prices right now are probably more influenced by the SRE and the Supreme Court and what the EPA is going to do. And I don't know that it's really so much about the fundamentals as uncertainty at this point. [Multiple Speakers] Joe Gorder : That's right. Yes. So, it doesn't change our renewable volume obligation at all. And I agree with Martin, the uncertainty around SREs and just what will happen on the Biden administration is really what's causing the RINs prices to surge. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Theresa Chen : Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the renewable diesel side. So, in terms of feedstocks, in a quarter where feedstock costs seem to have risen sharply and with planned maintenance at the facility, your capture was still very high. Can you talk about how you were able to achieve that? Is that sustainable? If there were any onetime factors that might have benefited the quarter? And going forward, as you think over the long-term about feedstock costs, just given the onslaught of projects that are under development, but to Manav's point now, even if not all of them will meet the time frame and capacity as originally planned, the absolute supply of renewable diesel will likely increase and thus increasing competition for feedstocks. And as such, do you see a shift in the type of feedstocks versus what you're currently using? Martin Parrish : Okay. Sure. Soybean oil was up 17% in fourth quarter versus third quarter. But as you noted, our EBITDA per gallon margins were flat quarter-on-quarter. If you look back in the past three years on renewable diesel, we've experienced wide swings and feedstock costs, RINs enterprises, D4 RINs, ULSD prices obviously a huge swing there. However, our annual margins have been very consistent, ranging from $2.19 a gallon in 2018 as a low to a high of $2.37 a gallon in 2020. So, you can see that the earnings power is there and consistent kind of regardless. And that's because the market works to compensate, PAT prices go up, the RIN goes up anyway. So, it all kind of works in concert there. So, long-term, on the next foreseeable future, let's say, we're not concerned with sourcing feedstocks. We believe our margin history is a good indicator of what to expect over time. Any one quarter can be plus or minus, but over time, we feel good about this margin indicator. Then, if you look to what happened with the soybean price, well, soybean price is driven by global supply and demand of veg oils. Palm oil prices were first to move up because production growth slowed in Indonesia and Malaysia, due to a drought and COVID-19, lack of labor to harvest the palm. Now, you've got soybean production is pretty tight this year. So, I worry about a lower crop down in Brazil. Soybean oil production is going to be impacted. You've got the kind of the whole ag commodity index moving up, so that's moving up soybean oil too. And then finally, veg oil pricing was low as compared to ULSD in 2018 and 2019. So, we expected some upward movement relative to ULSD. In response to this, more vegetable oil be produced in response to higher prices. And we don't see a long-term sustainable shift in vegetable oil pricing relative to low sulfur diesel. Theresa Chen : Thank you. And on the broader topic of energy transition, since the Biden Administration took office and made a series of very aggressive climate-related policy announcements, can you talk about how this plays out -- how you think this plays out for the industry in general from the perspective of CAFE standards, emissions, EV penetration, renewable fuels, et cetera? And particularly what you think the next step will be? Joe Gorder : Yes, sure. And we'll tag team this. I mean, Rich Walsh can cover kind of the policy side of this. But I mean, we have seen -- and we've seen it for some time now, the headlines are all focused on EVS, right? And everyone takes that into consideration when they're looking at the long-term outlook for oil demand going forward. And we just need to continue to look at the facts and keep it in perspective. EV sales last year made up slightly less than 2% of domestic car sales, just around 4% globally. And, I think if you look forward to developing countries, their focus is a whole lot less on climate change and EVs than it is in feeding their people and providing safe and affordable housing for them. So, there's a lot going on politically, but the reality is that cleaner fuels are going to be part of the future, EVs will be part of the future. But, it's far from -- that internal combustion engine is far from being extinct. And so, that's one thing that we have to all keep in mind I think as we go forward. We're still selling a tremendous amount of internal combustion engines that are more efficient. And our industry has done a fine job of working projects and adjusting operations to reduce the carbon intensity of the products that we're producing. And frankly, Valero, as you know, is doing a lot of that with the renewable diesel projects that we've undertaken. We're also doing it with carbon sequestration around our ethanol business. We're looking at hydrogen and so on. So anyway, there's a lot going on here. And I think, we'll continue to see overall the carbon intensity of traditional fuels, liquid fuels go down. And honestly, you can tell from our IR deck that already we're very competitive from a renewable diesel perspective with an EV. And I think, you'll see that continue to increase. So, I'll stop there. Rich, on the policy side? Rich Walsh : Yes. I mean Joe's right. I mean, of course, you see a lot of headlines on it. I mean, yesterday, they came out with an announcement on moving the federal fleet to EVs. But, we point out, that's very similar to the order that -- the executive order Obama issued in 2015, mandating that half of the fleet become EVs. And we didn't see a lot of movement in the federal fleet to EVs under that order. And it's a lot more difficult than you think to do that. The other thing that I would really like to emphasize is, our renewable diesel can drop in today, and on a life cycle basis outperforms an equivalent diesel electric truck. So, we can help the administration address this climate issue straight away, is order did call for clean and zero-emission vehicles, and ours are certainly clean. The other thing I'd point out, even in that order, you have to read the fine print, it requires that it'd be made in America and meet the federal procurement standards. And I'm not sure there is a lot of electric vehicles that can meet those requirements, but our renewable diesel is 100% American made, and it's ready to go now. So, we actually think that a lot of this will be -- in the end, the economics are overwhelming for our products. And they're ready to go now. So, we think we can work with the administration. We think there is going to be demand and policy drivers for lower carbon jewels, but we think that's a good thing for us, so. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And Joe, Happy New Year. I think, it's the first time you've spoken this year. Well, when I heard Doug and repositioning earlier, I thought I was looking over much over thinking someone hadn't told me something, but you may be a little nervous [Multiple Speakers]. But anyway, we've passed our congrats along to Doug. He is the oldest analyst in the sector, so I'm not sure I'm grateful for that, but so will be, anyway. So guys, two questions, please. I actually just want to start with a quick housekeeping question. Homer mentioned the $1 billion cash tax refund, not immaterial obviously. I just wanted to double check. Is that a one-off, or are there any other retrospective cash tax losses you can bring forward? Mark Schmeltekopf : Doug, this is Mark Schmeltekopf, that is a one-off item. Obviously, it relates to our 2020 tax NOL that's being carried back to 2015, and that's the only significant item of that. Doug Leggate : Okay. I just wanted to double check. Thank you. My follow-up, Joe, is probably a little bit more -- I guess, it's a more high level. You've talked a lot about EVS. I love that slide in your latest deck about the math. I'm just curious, the carbon sequestration on your ethanol business, where does that sit on the potential carbon capture on the refining business? Is that something you're pursuing, will pursue? Is it part of the discussion? I'm just curious as to how you address what your next steps are and what's already been some fairly significant moves to register carbon footprint of your fuels? Just what should we expect from the level next in that regard? Lane Riggs : Doug, this is Lane. I'll take a shot at that. So, the reason we choose some of these projects like the ethanol plants, it has to do with the gas that's coming off that plant is largely carbon dioxide. So, it\u2019s -- we're not having to further treat it before we find a way to sequester. So, we're trying to understand that, how that works, try to understand the technology and not certainly all the policy and all the other sort of the regulatory regime is going to be around carbon sequestration. So, it's a good place for us to really start and develop projects. The other way that we can do this is with our blue and green hydrogen. We're gating projects in that. That will also affect the carbon intensity of our transportation fuels. Some of which we've done, smaller ones, but we are certainly gating some larger ones that will make our transportation fuels. Depending on what market we can target them in, we'll obviously be helped with the overall -- our competitiveness from a carbon intensity perspective will help us. So, those are all -- those are the things that we're looking at. But I think, again, we're trying to hit -- from a carbon sequestration perspective, we're trying to hit the streams that we see that are lower in carbon dioxide on that gas and maybe just something that's been combusted, it has a lot of other stuff in like basically nitrogen and some other things. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : I guess, two questions. I want to follow up on your introductory comments, Joe. And the second one is a follow-up to some of the questions Theresa was asking about renewable diesel feedstock. So, the first one on the global capacity kind of expectation of future shutdowns, just curious how you see that unfolding, maybe where you see that unfolding, any particular trigger points? And then, on the renewable diesel feedstock, specific to your Phase 2 and your Phase 3 plans here that will roll out in '21 and '23 -- or into '21 and then in '23, how comfortable you are in terms of your line of sight to the necessary feedstocks in terms of the geographic Gulf Coast focus you have? Joe Gorder : Okay. So, which one of you guys want to talk about the first one, the closures? Lane Riggs : I guess, that will be me. Roger, it's Lane. So, we talked about this a little bit on some of the prior earnings calls. First, we've seen about 3 million barrels a day of refining closures. I think that we've been -- I don't know -- and I want to say pleasantly surprised but certainly surprised at the acceleration of some of these closures. Interestingly, a lot of it's occurred in the United States. I think that's a little bit of a surprise to us. But we've kind of done I would say our share or at least -- it doesn't mean that you won't have further closure potentially in the Atlantic basin on this side of the pond or maybe on the West Coast. But certainly, for now, the United States, I think about 800,000 to 900,000 barrels a day of announced closure. I think, if you look at trade flow though, where the closures, you could look for the closures going forward is primarily Europe, particularly Southern Europe. It has -- they don't really have access to an advantaged crude. They're more aggressive on -- with respect to their transition away from transportation, fossil fuel. So, I think that's where you'll see more and more -- that will be where you'll see more closures going forward. Joe Gorder : Martin, do you want to take the second half? Martin Parrish : Sure. On the feedstocks, Roger, right now, what we're looking at line of sight to 2023, we feel very about procuring these waste feedstocks that we need. If you look at it now, United States, as far as used cooking oil production and [indiscernible] production, they're large. U.S. is the biggest around that. And that comes with GDP per capita and plus established rendering operations and everything else. So, we feel good about that into the future. If you look, the U.S. is the place to be, the installed base of renewable diesel is still pretty small, especially the guys that are running the waste feedstock and pretreatment unit. And there's plenty of waste feedstuff just to procure. As you look farther down the road, you get past 2025 out to 2030, we expect to see quite a bit of growth in used cooking oil production and the animal [indiscernible]. And a lot of that's going to come from Asia at that point because that's where the population growth is. But historically, this waste feedstock growth has been pretty significant. And we expect that to continue. So, line of sight out to DGD 2 and 3, we don't see a problem. Joe Gorder : Hey Roger, we just -- I wanted to compliment you on your recent piece of work on the EV expansion and oil demand that was well done, very thoughtful and well done. And I would encourage everybody, if you haven't seen it, to take a look at it. Roger Read : I appreciate that. And sometimes when people have referred to me as a piece of work, it wasn't a compliment. So, I like that. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : I have two questions, maybe this is for Joe. I mean, Lane was earlier there talking about Europe maybe more facility is going to get shut. So, how we should look at the government policy and everything and put it into plan books, and that how are we going to position on the longer term? So, that's the first question. And second question that at some point the pandemic will over, you will generate free cash again. And at that point, when we're looking at your financial strategy, you have added several billion-dollar debt through this pandemic. We assume that you're going to first trying to pay it down. But, after the pandemic, if we're looking forward, will the Company take a more conservative approach and even drive down the debt ratio much below the pre-pandemic level? Thank you. Joe Gorder : That's good, Paul. Okay. We'll let -- I'll let Jason take the second part, and you directed the first one to me. Relative to Pembroke -- and Lane, you can chime in on this too, and Rich Walsh. But, when you look at Pembroke, it supplies domestic demands within the UK, and it also supplies Ireland and other countries. So, we do export out of Pembroke. We bring fuels to Canada when we need them out of Pembroke and so on. And so, it's one thing for politicians to come out and lay down a hard line and say that they're going to do something. But, there's human beings in that country as there are in our country who have purchased internal combustion engine vehicles, and they have an opportunity to weigh in on these issues and these decisions going forward. So, Paul, I think, we all get very concerned when we hear these things. But, if you just go back historically and look at how things play out, they don't always turn out exactly the way that we fear. Okay? It's usually never as bad as we think and never as good as we think. And I think that's certainly the case here. But, we have a clear focus on Pembroke. And Lane and his team are working on different options and different projects that are going to continue to make that a more efficient operation. So, Rich, anything you guys would add to that? Rich Walsh : No. I mean, I think you said it really well. I mean, if you look at -- like if you just take a look at say, California, you saw when their early announcements that were very aspirational about how they were going to drive down carbon. And we'll see directionally efforts to move in this way, and you're going to see increased electrification in these countries. But, as you get closer to these deadlines, what you tend to see is that the practicalities of this start to have an effect, and then they tend to move the target and reset the goals. And so, right now, there's a big drive on this. And the cost and the consequences of it will start to play out, and it will influence the policy going forward. I think, that's the best way I can describe it. Lane Riggs : Hi Paul, this is Lane. I'll just add one thing. When we're -- key to that trade flow and what we've always thought was more Southern Europe, that's going to be more exposed to closures, just because of where they're located in Europe and where the trade flow in crude is. Joe Gorder : Okay. And Jason, do you want to take the financial piece? Jason Fraser : Yes, sure. I mean, you're correct. One of our more immediate goals will be paying down some of the extra debt we've taken on during the pandemic, and as far as like our base assumption on debt-to-cap is 20%, 30% debt. But we are in a very dynamic time, right? We have energy transition going. We're growing our renewable diesel business. We're aggressively looking at other technologies. So, exactly how we end up participating in it and the capital needs of these new businesses may dictate a different structure. We're open to looking at things. And we recognize we're in a very a dynamic time, which is exciting. And so, we're not wed to that. We'll keep our minds open and see as things evolve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Ryan Todd : Maybe one quick follow-up on the renewable side. Sustainable aviation fuel is clearly going to play, I think, a large role in this mix going forward over the longer term. It's very small at this point. Can you talk a little bit about what you see as kind of the necessary steps to ramp up the sustainable aviation fuel market and how your renewable diesel facilities are positioned to be able to produce it? Martin Parrish : Sure. This is Martin. I think, the necessary step to ramp it up is really some -- you're going to have to get some mandates to require the use of it across the globe. Right now, it's out there. Is it going to happen? Yes, we feel pretty confident it's coming, but it's a big question of when. The modifications required at a plant that's producing renewable diesel to produce a sustainable aviation fuel, they're significant, but they aren't huge. So, we could pivot there when we need to pivot there. We'll obviously keep paying close attention to that and doing engineering on options. But, it's really about getting some mandated volume out there. Ryan Todd : And then, maybe just one -- I mean, you touched on parts of this earlier, but maybe just an overall follow-up on refining capture. I mean, you talked about how headline margins have bounced here recently. It feels like capture has stayed kind of stubbornly low on the refining side for the entire industry. Can you talk to me how you see some of those trends playing out over the course of the year? It sounds like maybe you expect RIN pricing to soften up some and differentials to widen out a little bit. Any thoughts on how, and the timing of that recovery over the course of the year? Gary Simmons : So, Ryan, this is Gary. I think, the key for us, as you know, we pride ourselves on our ability to optimize our refining system, especially on the feedstock side of the business. And with the very narrow crude quality differentials, it's been challenging to do that. So, you get to the second half of the year and more OPEC production on the market, potential easing of Venezuelan sanctions, potential easing of Iranian sanctions. All those things will allow us to do more optimization on the feedstock side. And as we do that, our capture rates would go up. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Benny Wong : Hey, Joe. In your prepared remarks, you highlighted your international strategy moving forward with the Veracruz terminal now started. Just curious if you can give us an update on the demand and margin outlook you're seeing in LatAm generally and maybe in Mexico specifically? I wanted to get a sense in terms of where they are in demand recovery and if there is any notable differences across regions that you're able to see? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, this is Gary. As Joe mentioned, we did put the Veracruz terminal on line at the end of the year. We have both, gasoline and diesel and tankage in Veracruz today. We're still doing some commissioning activity. So, we expect to have the truck rack operational in the next couple of weeks. Overall, our volumes for the quarter in Mexico were a little over 40,000 barrels a day. That's an increase of about year-over-year 145%. So, good growth in the country. However, from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we were down about 10%. The mobility data we see in Mexico is mobility was down about 20%. So, it still indicates we're continuing to gain market share, but we did see a big hit in mobility in Mexico, and we saw that reflected in our volumes. Moving forward, I mean, our -- we anticipate that the inland terminals associated with the Veracruz Marine terminal, probably come online early second quarter, one at Puebla and one in Mexico City. And that's really where you'll start to see our volumes ramp up as those inland terminals come on. Our goal is to get to about 80,000 barrels a day in that central system. The other thing that the Veracruz terminal does is it takes a lot of cost out of our supply chain. So, in addition to the ramp-up in volumes, we would also expect to see wider margins on the volume that we're selling in country. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : My question is on the operating side. Your first quarter throughputs are sort of flat quarter-over-quarter, at least in the Gulf Coast. And so, I'm just wondering, as we kind of enter this recovery phase and like you said, crack spreads are even starting to pick up a little bit here concurrently with demand. How do you balance what you see on the commercial side with your operating rates, how much you want to ramp utilization versus what your assessment is of what the market can tolerate and various sort of commodity scenarios? I'm just curious how you work through that as you think about utilization? Lane Riggs : Hey Sam, this is Lane. I'll take a shot and maybe Gary can follow up, if there's anything. We're certainly positioned in the Gulf Coast. If recovery -- if things recover quicker, our rates could be higher, but we're trying to be -- we're obviously being very careful and trying to not get our supply line chain very extended. So, we have strategies around that, try to think about -- make sure that we don't have a lot of pricing exposure and trying to position our assets sort of in a conservative posture just to make sure that we're well-positioned going into this, but we can certainly raise rates as the -- if we see things getting better. Gary Simmons : Yes. I would just tag on to that. I think, the key for us is looking [indiscernible] and especially if we're able to ramp up utilization and it results in higher exports, and we have good margin to do that, we feel comfortable raising utilization. Sam Margolin : Okay. And then, one follow-up, if I might, just on an energy transition theme, and specifically EVs, there's a certain amount of petroleum products that are in EVs along with sort of other materials and processes that are associated with the energy transition. So, the question is, you guys can make anything, they might not be things you're focused on today, but you weren't necessarily focused on renewable diesel until you figured out the right way to build and structure that business. So, looking out over the horizon, maybe not over the immediately investable horizon, how do you think about the potential to kind of remix your product streams into things like specialty chemicals or other materials that are sort of more thematic, if not necessarily today, over your investment hurdles? Lane Riggs : So Sam, I'll take it. This is Lane. We've looked quite a bit of diversifying into petrochemicals. We continue to look at it. We have a -- it's just -- it hasn't met our gating threshold. So, we would -- but we're going to continue to look at it, because obviously, it's something that we could do. It's not too far out of our wheelhouse to do. But, so far, when we do a lot of these things, we haven't found them to be better than some of our other projects. For example, renewable diesel projects, right? I mean, in a world where we're going to put money, that's -- today, that's where we put our money instead of sort of petrochemical path. It doesn't mean that we are not -- we're closed to the idea. But certainly, we like our investments in sort of this lower -- this carbon transition in terms of trying to lower the carbon intensity of transportation fuels. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our allotted time for the Q&A session. At this point, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Bhullar for any additional concluding comments. Homer Bhullar : Great. Thank you. I appreciate everyone joining us. And for those that didn't get a chance to ask a question, please feel free to contact me and happy to chat with you. Please everyone stay safe and healthy, and have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Once again, we thank you for your participation.

[Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President Investor Relations. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Homer and good morning, everyone. The refining business saw a strong recovery in the first quarter as various pandemic imposed restrictions were eased or withdrawn and as more and more people receive vaccinations. However, Winter Storm Uri disrupted many U.S. Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent facilities in February due to the freeze and utilities curtailments. Although our refineries and plants in those regions were also impacted, they did not suffer any significant mechanical damage and were restarted within a short period after the storm. While we did incur extremely high energy costs, I'm very proud of the Valero team for safely managing the crisis by idling or shutting down the effected facilities and resuming operations without incident. With many of the countries Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent refineries offline due to the storm, there was a significant 60 million barrel drawdown of surplus product inventories in the U.S. bringing product inventories to normal levels. Lower product inventories, coupled with increasing product demand, improve refining margins significantly from the prior quarter. Crude oil discounts were also wider for Canadian heavy and WTI in the first quarter, relative to the fourth quarter of last year, providing additional support to refining margins. In addition, our renewable diesel segment continues to provide solid earnings and set records for operating income and renewable diesel product margin in the first quarter of 2021. Our wholesale operations also continue to see positive trends in U.S. demand. And we expanded our supply into Mexico with current sales of over 60,000 barrels per day, which should continue to increase with the ramp-up of supply through the Veracruz terminal. On the strategic front, we continue to evaluate and pursue economic projects that lower the carbon intensity of all of our products. In March, we announced that we were partnering with BlackRock and Navigator to develop a carbon capture system in the Midwest, allowing for conductivity of eight of our ethanol plants to the system. In addition to the tax credit benefit for CO2 capture and storage, Valero will also capture higher value for the lower carbon intensity ethanol product and low carbon fuel standard markets, such as California. The system is expected to be capable of storing 5 million metric tonnes of CO2 per year. In our Diamond Green Diesel 2 project at St. Charles remains on budget and is now expected to be operational in the middle of the fourth quarter of this year. The expansion is expected to increase renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year, bringing the total capacity at St. Charles to 690 million gallons per year. The expansion will also allow us to market 30 million gallons per year of renewable naphtha from DGD 1 and DGD 2 into low carbon fuel markets. The renewable diesel project at Port Arthur or DGD 3 continues to move forward as well. This is expected to be operational in the second half of 2023. With the completion of this 470 million gallons per year capacity plant DGD's combined annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. With respect to our refinery optimization projects, we remain on track to complete the Pembroke Cogen project in the third quarter of this year and the Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in 2023. As we head into summer, we believe that there's a pent-up desire among much of the population to travel and take vacations, which should drive incremental demand for transportation fuels. We're already seeing a star strong recovery in gasoline and diesel demand at 93% and 100% of pre-pandemic levels respectively. Since March, air travel has also increased. As reflected in TSA data, which shows that passenger count is now nearly double of what it was in January. We're also seeing positive signs in the crude market with wider discounts for sour crude oils and residual feedstocks relative to bread is an incremental crude oil from the Middle East comes to market. All these positive data points coupled with less refining capacity as a result of refinery rationalizations should lead to continued improvement in refining margins in the coming months. We've already seen the impacts of these improving market indicators with Valero having positive operating income and operating cash flow in March. In closing, we're encouraged by the outlook on refining as product demand steadily improves towards pre-pandemic levels, which should continue to have a positive impact on refining margins. We believe these improvements coupled with our growth strategy and low carbon renewable fuels will further strengthen our long-term competitive advantage. So with that Homer I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the first quarter of 2021, we incurred a net loss attributable to Valero stockholders of $704 million, or $1.73 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.9 billion, or $4.54 per share, for the first quarter of 2020. The first quarter of 2021 operating loss includes estimated excess energy costs of $579 million, or $1.15 per share. For the first quarter of 2020 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $140 million, or $0.34 per share. The adjusted results exclude an after-tax lower of cost or market, or LCM, inventory valuation adjustment of approximately $2 billion. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany the earning release. The refining segment reported an operating loss of $592 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to an operating loss of $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2020. The first quarter 2021 adjusted operating loss for the refining segment was $554 million, compared to adjusted operating income of $329 million for the first quarter of 2020, which excludes the LCM inventory valuation adjustment. The refining segment operating loss for the first quarter of 2021 includes estimated excess energy costs of $525 million related to impacts from Winter Storm Uri. Refinery throughput volumes in the first quarter of 2021 averaged 2.4 million barrels per day, which was 414 thousand barrels per day lower than the first quarter of 2020 due to scheduled maintenance and disruptions resulting from Winter Storm Uri. Throughput capacity utilization was 77% in the first quarter of 2021. Refining cash operating expenses of $6.78 per barrel were higher than guidance of $4.75 per barrel primarily due to estimated excess energy costs related to impacts from Winter Storm Uri of $2.21 per barrel. Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was a record $201 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $198 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 867,000 gallons per day in the first quarter of 2021. The ethanol segment reported an operating loss of $56 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to an operating loss of $197 million for the first quarter of 2020. The operating loss for the first quarter of 2021 includes estimated excess energy costs of $54 million related to impacts from Winter Storm Uri. First quarter of 2020 adjusted operating loss, which excludes the LCM inventory valuation adjustment was $69 million. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.6 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2021, which was 541,000 gallons per day lower than the first quarter of 2020. For the first quarter of 2021, G&A expenses were $208 million and net interest expense was $149 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $578 million and the income tax benefit was $148 million in the first quarter of 2020. The effective tax rate was 19%. Net cash used in operating activities was $52 million in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of $184 million and our joint venture partners 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash used in operating activities was $344 million. With regard to investing activities, we made $5820 million of total capital investments in the first quarter of 2021, of which $333 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance; and $249 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $479 million in the first quarter of 2021. On April 2019, we sold a partial membership interest in the Pasadena marine terminal joint venture for $270 million. Moving to financing activities. We returned $400 million to our stockholders in the first quarter of 2021 through our dividend. And as you saw earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.7 billion, and cash and cash equivalents were $2.3 billion. The debt to capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents, was 40%. At the end of March, we had $5.9 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. Almost half of our growth CapEx in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.65 million to 1.7 million barrels per day, Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 250,000 to 270,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 340,000 to 360,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $4.20 per barrel. With respect to the renewable diesel segment with the start up of DGD 2 in the fourth quarter, we now expect sales volumes to average 1 million gallons per day in 2021. Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.1 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $150 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $590 million. For 2021, we still expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $850 million, and the annual effective tax rate should approximate the U.S. statutory rate. Lastly, as we reported last quarter, we expect to receive a cash tax refund of approximately $1 billion later this year. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Please respect this request to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Roger Read : Thank you. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : I guess I'd like to take into account your outlook, well comments about where we are in terms of demand, your outlook, in terms of volumes for Q2. And then look at the crude runs that you had Q1 of 2021 versus Q1 of 2020. It seems like all the decline came out of Light Sweet crudes and kind of Residuals and other. And I was curious as we go forward your comment about a little more crude coming from OPEC. Should we anticipate more of the volumes likely to be on the medium and heavy side, the sour side where you tend to get a little more advantage on crude differentials or is it really that the opportunity lies on the Light Sweet crude side just because that's what's come off in terms of the system? Joe Gorder : How many questions was that, Roger? Roger Read : Well, I know it's a two-question rule, but I'm just \u2013 it's a way of trying to\u2026 Joe Gorder : No. No. We got it. We got it. Roger Read : Crude is supposed to \u2013 which crude you're going to run. Joe Gorder : No. I'm kidding. Gary is prepared for this, so I'll let him fire away. Gary Simmons : Hey, good morning, Roger. Our view coming into the years and we would see fairly narrow crude quality differentials for the first half of the year, but as global oil demand picked up, a great percentage of that would be filled with additional OPEC production, which would cause the quality differentials to widen back out. I think by and large that that view is still holding. Most forecast show about 4 million barrels a day of additional OPEC production coming on the market to second half of the year. In fact at the last OPEC meeting, they're saying we could see as much as 2.1 million barrels of that as early as July. I think the only thing that's different is the quality differentials have widened a little bit faster than what we thought and it's for a number of reasons. The winter storm brought down a lot of high complexity, refining capacity that pushed medium and heavy sour crude back to the market and help widen those quality differentials. After the winter storm, we had the release from the strategic petroleum reserve; put 10 million barrels of medium sour on the market, which again pressured that ASCI differential. We're seeing more Iranian and Venezuelan barrels on the market where it's not flowing to the U.S. but flowing through the Far East, and it's taken some of the pressure off the medium sours in the U.S. Gulf Coast. And then recently we had the refinery fire in Mexico, which has put more my out on the market. So we think the combination of the events have happened recently additional OPEC barrels on the market. We also think you'll see more heavy Canadian with the recovery and flat price and production quotas being lifted there that the differentials will continue to widen. To your question, we have seen a switch in economic signals. Of course, it's very dependent on location and refinery configuration, but some of our refineries today; the economic signals are pointing us to run more heavy sour, and we're seeing fairly equal economics between medium sour, grapes and Light Sweet. Roger Read : All right, guys, I'll leave it there since I did ask. Thank you. Joe Gorder : No, Roger. Roger Read : Thank you. Joe Gorder : We really appreciated. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Theresa Chen [Barclays]. Please proceed with your question. Theresa Chen : Good morning, everyone. So I'd like to dig a little \u2013 morning. I'd like to dig a little deeper on your comments about your carbon capture strategy. Maybe beginning with how your partnership with Navigator came about. And what can we expect in terms of the economics net to Valero? And if you intend to do something similar for your other facilities in the Gulf Coast, for example, especially on the heels of a competitor announcement building this type of infrastructure out in a major way along the Houston Ship Channel? Joe Gorder : No. That's a good question. And Rich and Martin worked together, and Rich was kind of the architect behind this. So we'll let him take a crack at this. Rich Lashway : Sure. So I'll just kind of back up. So Valero is going to be the anchor shipper on this project. BlackRock is the financial backer, and Navigator is leading the engineering, construction and operations for the carbon capture and sequestration. We're estimating that by doing this, we'll lower the carbon intensity of the ethanol that we produce from kind of a 70 CI down to 40 CI. And I'll let Martin kind of talk about the value creation there. But, today, the CI ethanol carries a premium into the California market, and the economics are supported by the California market and the 45Q tax credit. And we expect that further markets will develop for the low-carbon fuels, so increasing demand for this premium product. Today, Navigator is out there. They've launched their nonbinding open season, which is basically to kind of determine what kind of demand will be for this project so that they can rightsize the project and also kind of optimize on the routing. The open season is going very well, and we're seeing strong interest from ethanol producers and other industry players, but we're especially surprised by the strong interest from the fertilizer plants. And given the strong interest in the project, they will be moving forward with the binding open season this summer. And if you wanted more information, they've got a website out there. It's just navigatorco2.com, which kind of goes over the \u2013 kind of the open-season process and kind of a preliminary mapping of how the pipeline system is going to kind of work. Martin Parrish : Thanks, Rich. Theresa, this is Martin. Yes. So the 70 to a 40 CI reduction in ethanol, that's worth like right now $0.47 a gallon at $200 a ton. And even out into the future, it stays right in that range, about $0.50 a gallon at a $200 per ton carbon price. As Rich said, we've got California and Oregon with programs now. We expect New York, New Mexico, Washington; they all have legislation in place for low carbon. We expect those to happen over some time in the next few years. So as this project has got a time line to completion, we expect no slowing down in low-carbon mandates or clean fuel standard mandates. So that's the additional demand for the product there. Theresa Chen : Very helpful. And then within the broader LCFS framework, I wanted to ask about your renewable diesel business given the strength in margins as well as volumes. And maybe just on the impressive margin per unit result, can you explain what drove that this quarter, especially with the backdrop of rising feedstock cost, and if these high margins are sustainable? Martin Parrish : Sure. I'll take a stab at that. Well, it was a good quarter, right? $2.75 per gallon EBITDA and if you look versus first quarter of 2020, soybean oil price is up 1.6 times, but the D4 RIN price is up 2.6 times. So the D4 RIN has done a lot of lifting, and that's provided margin. So we're looking \u2013 I think if you look over history, we've had a pretty good stress test the last three years. We've had a wide variation in RIN prices, wide variation in feedstock prices, wide variation ULSD prices, yet our margin has only varied from 2.17 a gallon EBITDA in 2018 to 2.37 a gallon EBITDA in 2020. And now, last \u2013 first quarter of 2020, first quarter of 2021, about the same and is 2.70 EBITDA range. So again, a pretty good stress test. So we feel pretty comfortable about those kind of margins going forward for the foreseeable future. Theresa Chen : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Phil Gresh of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gresh : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gresh : My first question is on the second quarter utilization guidance. The midpoint there was about 87%, with 91%, I think, in the Gulf Coast and the Mid-Con. And obviously, that's a bit above the April DOE, and there's obviously seasonality benefits as we move into the summer. So I'm just curious how you expect demand and utilization to progress into the summer. And do you think the crack spreads today weren't running that high of a level of utilization? Or is it an expectation of even higher cracks moving forward? Thank you. Lane Riggs : Hey, Phil. This is Lane. So really, if you look at our guidance, it's somewhat consistent with where we're kind of running today. But there is \u2013 we have turnarounds in some of the refineries. But the current track, there's a call on refining to run at reasonably high rates. It's just a matter of how you're going to posture yourself and look at your supply chain. And so we're sort of inching up as an industry, but certainly, where margins are today and our margins going forward are that you'll see increasing utilization in the industry. Phil Gresh : Okay. Got it. And the second question would be on the balance sheet. Obviously, you have the tax refund coming. There is the Pasadena asset sale here in April. So I'm curious how you're thinking about the leverage targets and whether there might be other asset sale opportunities like Pasadena, just some low-hanging fruit out there that could help accelerate any debt-reduction objectives? Thank you. Jason Fraser : Yes. This is Jason. I can talk a little bit about how we're \u2013 see in the next 12 months with regard to debt reduction and capital allocation. Then Joe, if you want somebody else to talk about other potential opportunities? Joe Gorder : Yes. Okay. Jason Fraser : Well, like Joe said, in March, we had our first month with positive operating income and cash flow and to the demand in the markets are looking good. So things are definitely improving. It's hard to tell the exact pace that the margins and cash flows are going to recover, but we're certainly headed in the right direction. So some of the things we'll be looking at as margins start normalizing and cash flow starting normalizing is first thing we want to do is build our cash balance. We'll likely take our target up from the $2 billion range to the $3 billion-plus range. That will help our net debt to cap come down naturally as we do that. And as you asked about on the leverage side, the additional debt we took on was relatively short-term. The vast majority was three to five years in the base case. But we are going to look to pull some of that back in early. And the first thing we'll look at is this $575 million of freezer floaters that are callable beginning in September. So I imagine that's the first thing we'll pay up. Joe Gorder : And then, Phil, just as it relates to the asset sales, and we don't have anything else in mind. And frankly, we didn't do this because we were in any kind of desperate need for cash. We did it because it was a smart thing to do financially. And when we developed this project and a few others that we developed and then kind of base loaded, the plan was that we would want use of the asset, but not necessarily need to own the asset. And so this was part of the plan all along. It's not something that I would consider to be abnormal. But at the same time, the motivation for it was that it was an attractive business transaction rather than a need for cash. Phil Gresh : Okay. Great. Can I just clarify; is the $1 billion tax refund still a 2Q target or just latest thoughts on magnitude and timing? Thank you. Jason Fraser : Yes. Well, that is what we were thinking before, to talk a little bit more about that. We filed our tax \u2013 both our return and our refund request back in mid-January. It was a really big accomplishment for our tax department. We've never filed that early before, and I think most people don't. But unfortunately, it looks like the IRS is experiencing significant delays in processing these returns and the refund request. My understanding was that they normally turn around in a 90- to 120-day time frame. But with these COVID impacts, timing is uncertain this year. We certainly still expect to receive the full tax refund, but it may slip from the second quarter. Phil Gresh : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Prashant Rao of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Prashant Rao : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Prashant. Prashant Rao : I wanted to just \u2013 I have a two-parter, and I'll leave it with my compound question here, on DGD on the feedstock side. Martin, I think you're being a bit humble in saying the RIN was doing a lot of it \u2013 it was, but you guys also are \u2013 have advantaged feedstock and the way you set up that project. So I'm curious about your outlook going forward. One, it looks like \u2013 I know soybean is not something you were that exposed to, but the curve is showing some backwardation ahead, but really not a full mean reversion. So curious about what gets us going in terms of some deflation, reversing some of these inflation trends we've seen over the last couple of quarters for the overall complex. I guess soybean kind of the key that people key off of when they're making their assumptions? And then second, as we see that happen, how should we think about divergences or the advantage in your feedstocks like DCO or animal fats, UCO, other feedstocks that you're using the non-soy versus SPO as we start to see things deflate? And I'll leave it with that one. Martin Parrish : Sure, Prashant. So I think what you have to do is if you kind of step back and look what's really \u2013 soybean oil gets the attention in United States. But what's really going on is the worldwide veg oil price and it's just \u2013 it's up. And why it's up? First of all, it was really low in 2018 and 2019. So we had some periods where it was low versus history. And by that, I mean, relative to ULSD. So soybean oil price is driven by the global supply and demand of veg oils. Soybean oil, palm oil and rapeseed oil are all up 60% to 95% year-on-year. Palm oil production in Indonesia was off because of a drought in 2020 and labor shortages due to COVID-19. You also had U.S. soybean oil production in the 2019/2020 crop year or just soybean production was like 80% of the previous year. So you also have to remember, you had the trade sanctions. So China wasn't in. China pulled down stocks a lot. They weren't in the market for the soybean oil. So prices dropped, not as much was produced. Well, now China is back in the market. The world is recovering. So you've got a big demand now out there for veg oils. So we kind of got into this place because of low prices, and we'll get out of it because of high prices. So all these can be grown on demand. So the cure for high prices is high prices. So we'll eventually work our way out of it, but it's going to take a little while. Now obviously, DGD's advantages were we're not running the veg oils other than the distiller\u2019s corn oil, which is an inedible veg oil. So we expect to continue to see those feedstocks price at a discount to soybean oil. But the biggest advantage is the CI score of those oils, those waste oils, compared to a veg oil or compared to the soybean oil in most jurisdictions. So that's really what drives DGD. And by having our robust pretreatment system, our location, our ability to run anything is just a huge advantage. Prashant Rao : Thanks for that. That's super helpful. I'll leave it at that. Operator : The next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Homer Bhullar : Doug, you might be on mute, buddy. Doug Leggate : Is that any better, guys? Can you hear me? Joe Gorder : You bet. Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate : Okay. Good stuff. Good morning, Joe. Joe, I want to ask also about the broader kind of carbon footprint of Valero. I'm looking at Slide 5 on your deck. And I'm just wondering, with the latest announcement for the carbon pipeline and with obviously the potential for additional DGD plants, what is the objective for Valero overall? Is it basically to get that carbon footprint neutral negative? What's the general strategic objective of how you're building up your green credentials, if you like? Joe Gorder : Now, that's a good question, Doug. And obviously, I mean, you can tell from the chart and you can tell from where we're spending our capital that we have a clear recognition here that low-carbon fuels are going to be in much greater demand going forward. The interesting thing here from our perspective is that we've been able to come up with low-carbon fuel projects and projects that have enabled us to reduce the carbon intensity of some of our other fuels with projects that have significant returns also. I mean its one thing to try to have that drive to find compliance with Paris to go to carbon neutrality and so on. That's all fine and good. But it's also critical that, when we're on that path that we do it in a way that continues to deliver financial returns for our investors, and so while we continue to look at not only the projects that are listed here. I mean, obviously, the carbon sequestration pipeline is the next extension after we were in ethanol first and then renewable diesel and now this. And there's other projects that we're taking a look at, too, that are going to help us on this path going forward. The targets we've set for ourselves to hit by 2025, we think, are very achievable. And I don't think that you should expect that our goals are going to continue to be pushed forward from there. So we want to be viable for the long-term. We believe that liquid fuels are going to be part of the energy mix going forward. It's infeasible to think that they wouldn't. And we just want to do our part and continue to provide low-carbon products. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the full answer. I do have a quick follow-up, and it's related specifically to LCFS. And I guess, I'm going to be very honest with you, Joe. We were having a tough time modeling the sustainable discounted free cash flow, if you like, for Diamond Green Diesel because we don't know what the LCFS, how that's going to evolve. So I just wonder if you could \u2013 whichever one of you guys wants to answer this. How do you think about when you look at the economics of the project? How do you guys think about forecasting the scenarios for how LCFS can evolve? Because obviously, everybody in their [indiscernible] kind of coming up with projects, including electric vehicle charging stations, which are another offset, which can start to bite into that LCFS. So how are you thinking about modeling the payback and the assumption of LCFS in your projects? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Martin Parrish : Okay. Yes. This is Martin. I mean, the way we're looking at it is \u2013 obviously, California is there with the program. We think if Oregon is there with the program. Canada has got a clean fuel standard that's going to be in place. And the Canadian demand on diesel is about twice as high as California demand. And then you've got all these other programs. You've got the EU now with Red 2 out to 2030, California out to 2030. So while there's a lot of projects announced, there's also a lot of incremental demand announced. And if you look at generation to date, what's carrying the load for California is renewable diesel, biodiesel and ethanol that 70% of the credits generated is that. So when we look at the time line for the economics and what we're looking at for the Diamond Green projects, they pay out pretty quick, right? So, but we're not \u2013 and we don't see anything changing materially, and certainly through 2025 type time frame and even beyond that, we don't see this is changing that much. So we feel pretty good about that. I think CARB, if you have a carbon price go down, they're going to adjust that up. I mean I think they've pretty well signaled that this $200 a ton is kind of the sweet spot for them and 200, 200-plus. And so we feel pretty good about demand, and I think the flip side is a lot of these projects that are announced, if you go back in history, they just don't happen and we don't see anything that's going to change that trend. Jason Fraser : Doug, you may recall \u2013 Doug, you may recall when we issued guidance on the DGD 2, right? Like our portion of the cost was $550 million, and our EBITDA guidance was $250 million and that was based on $1.26 EBITDA, right? And you compare that to the $2.75 that we generated last quarter, just gives you some context of how much room there is. Doug Leggate : Very, very quick payback. Guys, maybe just tag on one last one real quick. Valero's view on carbon tax, positive or negative? And I'll leave it at that. Joe Gorder : Who wants to take that one? Rich? Rich Lashway : Carbon tax. Well, so you see various discussion points out there, you've got some trade groups; you've got other folks talking about carbon tax. It will be, generally speaking, in terms of best ways to reduce carbon emissions, the most efficient way to do that in the economy is with a tax. We would say the key components of this is the tax has to be applied broadly across the entire economy. You need to make sure it doesn't result in exporting the emissions outside the country. So you're going to have to have some kind of border adjustment process around it. But, yes, I think a carbon tax is an efficient way to address some of these issues and to help lower carbon. I'd point out that we do quite well in the \u2013 in this low-carbon fuel environment, and so we think we would be advantaged under that regime as well. Doug Leggate : Thanks very much, guys. Operator : The next question is from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Sam Margolin : Good morning. How's everybody doing? Joe Gorder : All right. Sam, well. And you? Sam Margolin : Good. Thanks. Thank you, sir. I have a question to start off about RINs. And I guess it affects both DGD and the refining business. We're starting to see some companies emerge that are RINs-generating businesses that are selling forward their RINs. In some cases, not even to obligated parties at a fixed price and then the off-taker takes the risk of the RIN price. Is that something that's interesting to you either at DGD to kind of smooth that variability in results or even in the refining segment to add some visibility there? Lane Riggs : Sam, this is Lane. We obviously are in a net position of buying RIN. So any way that we \u2013 any counterparty that as a novel way to getting RINs on the market, we obviously could be on the other side of that. As it's related to renewable diesel, I'm going to kick it over Martin. Martin Parrish : Yes, Sam. So I think when we look at our margin structure, there's probably no need. I mean we think that \u2013 with the RIN, if you step back and look at this, the price of the D4 RIN is based on the spread between biodiesel and ULSD. And then the driver for the biodiesel price is almost entirely soybean oil because that's the marginal feed for the biodiesel producer. So then, therefore, if you have at a given ULSD price, the D4 RIN is high, if soybean oil is high and the D4 RIN is low of soybean oil is low. So as renewable diesel feedstock prices move with soybean oil, renewable diesel margin is not necessarily higher with D4 RINs as they appreciate. Now D6 RINs are a whole different story. They're dependent on the renewable volume obligation and whether D4 RINs are needed to satisfy the total renewable fuels obligation. If D4 RINs are needed, then that D6 price is going to approach the D4 price, and that's the case we're in today. The D4 is right up against the D6. So D4s are tied to the production cost of biodiesel. We don't see that fundamentally changing. And then the D6 just depends on the total renewable fuel obligation and whether additional biodiesel is needed to balance that equation. So a D6 can be about anywhere, a ceiling of D4 down to zero, but a D4 has got some fundamentals behind it. So we don't really see the need to protect that. Sam Margolin : Okay. Thank you. And this follow-up is about carbon capture. It sort of relates to Doug's last question on a carbon tax. But just because of your experience in the LCFS and now as a shipper in a CCS project, Valero is very far ahead of the industry in terms of understanding the impact of a price of carbon or cost of carbon on energy markets and how it flows to the consumer, and there's a debate now about whether that is a restriction on the potential scale of carbon capture as a solution. So I'd ask you just to kind of comment broadly or specifically about how you see the world with a carbon price and whether it's applicable to, say, outfit an entire refining system with some kind of carbon capture solution, if that makes sense based on the way it interacts with consumers? Thank you. Joe Gorder : Yes. There's a lot of facets to that question. I mean, I wouldn't presume to say that we're ahead of anybody in looking at this. Perhaps we are, but that's not a claim, I don't think, that we would be willing to make. Lane can speak here about potential things that we could look at in the refineries to continue to do this. But the projects that we've looked at thus far all related to our core business. There's no particular step out that we've had here. We're in the ethanol business. We've been in the pipeline business for a long time, and we're in the refining business. So you want to speak at all about\u2026 Lane Riggs : I'm not sure I provide a lot of tremendous insight in this. I would say that we went around and looked at all of our sort of our stacks for carbon dioxide, obviously, is coming on. And we focused our efforts on where carbon dioxide is concentrated in those stacks. And therefore, it's easier to sequester it and get it targeted. So those are \u2013 and we're doing that in whatever the regime is, whether it's an LCFS market or it's in the CCUS market. So those are \u2013 that's how we're doing it for now, right? And again, so you can see where we've landed. We're doing ethanol. We're looking at \u2013 we have some SMRs that predominantly have CO2 as a flue gas and our flue gas. So those sort of things that we're analyzing. But there is ultimately needs to be more certainty and more of a larger framework out there for that kind of investment for refining and \u2013 and you need a carbon price that's a little bit higher, something more on the order of like the LCFS carbon prices. Joe Gorder : Yes. Anything you want to add, Martin? Martin Parrish : No. That's the point. I mean, Lane hit it on the head. When you look at an ethanol plant, it's a cost-effective way. You've got basically pure CO2. And it's at one point, one stack in the plant. Then you also have this 45Q and the CI reduction. So when you get to a \u2013 and then steam methane reformer can make sense too. But when you get to most of our refineries, we're not accessing those low-carbon markets. You've got a lot of sources. So you're going to have to get a higher carbon price, and that's what it's going to take to get more going on in the carbon sequestration market. Sam Margolin : Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from Manav Gupta of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Manav Gupta : Hey, guys. Thank you. Joe, my question is more specific to the U.S. demand. I think we're getting a lot of negative attention from the COVID spikes in other parts of the world, but things are looking pretty good in the U.S. as per your initial comments. I'm trying to understand, in your opinion, how far are we in terms of time frame where we could go back to pre-pandemic level demand for gasoline, diesel and domestic jet, even if you leave out the international jet? How far are we from a point where we could see a full recovery in the three key products in the U.S.? Joe Gorder : Mr. Simmons? Gary Simmons : Yes. So as Joe mentioned, gasoline recovery has gone very well. A combination of the vaccine rollout and economic stimulus has driven a rapid recovery and demand for our products. Our wholesale numbers are pretty consistent with the DOE data. I think our seven-day average is about 95% of pre-pandemic level, which is where Wednesday stats came out on the DOE as well. So a little bit below the five-year average, but well within the five-year average range. We're pretty bullish on gasoline going forward, not only due to the pace of recovery, but we think there's a number of factors that could be very supportive for gasoline demand. As people return to a normal style of life, we're seeing that people are driving more and kind of avoiding mass transit. For the summer season, we believe that a lot of people that want to go on vacation will again maybe avoid travel on an airplane and taking more driving vacations. And then just as Joe alluded to, because people felt trapped in their home for a year now, they'll spend more of the discretionary income on experiences like vacation rather than things. So everything domestically on the gasoline front looks very good. And even though we've seen spikes of COVID cases around the world, our domestic export markets are starting to pick up as well. Mexico gasoline demand in March was up 11% from February. So the gasoline side looks very good. On the diesel side, we've really been in this mode where diesel demand is almost fully recovered. We're starting to see very strong diesel demand, especially in our Mid-Continent system today as agricultural demand is starting to kick in. And the combination of the economic stimulus and infrastructure build, we think drives economic growth and will cause sustained strong diesel demand moving forward. You also talked about jet, and certainly we felt like jet would lag in terms of demand recovery. And it has. But if you look at the DOE stats this week, we're at 76% pre-pandemic levels. And I think if you look at a lot of the leading indicators, the TSA passenger counts look very strong, and that's not fully showing up in the DOE data yet. So far, the airlines have chosen just to put more passengers on a plane, but we're getting to an inflection point where now they're starting to add flights. You can see that in jet fuel nominations and also the fact that airlines are calling their pilots and their crews back and starting to add flights. So I think if you look at where jet demand could go; pre pandemic, about 81% of flights in the U.S. were domestic flights. I think we could get that demand back. That last 20% in terms of international travel will probably take a little longer to recover there. Manav Gupta : Yes. Perfect. My quick follow-up here is your renewable diesel results clearly are reflecting two very high-quality companies working together, and it's kind of showing up in the results. And my point is, I think if something is still working so well then you should do more of it. As I understand, when you designed DGD 3, you did leave space at Port Arthur for a DGD 4, exactly like DGD 1 and 2 at St. Charles. So at what point \u2013 will you wait for DGD 2 to start up? But at what point does Valero and Darling come together and start looking at a DGD 4 at Port Arthur facility? And I'll leave it there. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Manav. So who wants to do that? Martin or Lane? Lane Riggs : I'll take a shot. Manav, this is Lane. So everything you said is absolutely correct. We've left \u2013 we've left plot area to look at Diamond Green for there. But we want to see how the market develops. We want to understand sustainable aviation fuel, which is another option for us in the space. So we're developing projects along both those lines, and we'll just see how the world works. But we got to get two of these started up and get them done. As you've seen, our schedules are doing much better, and so we're actually bringing these to market earlier. And our real focus right now is to do just that. Our guys go there. We're very much involved in trying to accelerate these projects and bring them forward any way possible because of, as you can see, the economics and the projects. Manav Gupta : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Paul. Paul Cheng : I think that I'm going to ask two questions. One is maybe as a multiple part related to the COVID. Joe Gorder : Come at it, buddy. Come at it. We expect nothing less. Paul Cheng : Joe, I'm guilty as charged. For the DGD 2, can you give us a percentage of your feedstock that is the advantage of feedstock like the waste oil and all that? And also then, when we're looking at your renewable on the CST supply contract, I think you generate quite a fair amount of the RIN there. And can you tell us that, I mean, how much is the win you generate from those contracts and when that will expire? And when you talk about, I think, Martin, on the CCS band opinion in the ethanol, so that's related to eight of your plan out of the 16? So should we assume that half of your throughput volume will get that benefit of the $0.47 per gallon of the credit if we assume the LCFS maintained at 200? So that's the first question? Should I go ahead and \u2013 before I ask the second? Homer Bhullar : Well, but we're trying to figure that one out. But you're going to have to wait for even the second part of the first question. Joe Gorder : That was good. Martin Parrish : On the feedstock, DGD 2, I mean, we're expecting \u2013 we're going to have a higher mix of tallow, but we still expect the feedstocks for DGD 2 to be advantaged. So it's the same cast of characters, the used cooking oil, the tallow, the distiller\u2019s corn oil of ethanol plants. So that's what we expect to be stock for DGD 2 to be. But certainly, we'll be heading for more tallow. Used cooking oil is pretty close to being tapped out right now in the U.S. More of that will show up with these high prices that's what we expect. So what's \u2013 and then the ethanol question is, what was that carbon sequestration? How much of our volume is \u2013 what we're planning \u2013 what we're looking at, certainly, there's been a few questions the California market can't absorb it all. And it depends on how many of these ethanol projects happen. California is 10% of the U.S. gasoline market. So it's 10% of the U.S. ethanol market. But we certainly expect by the time we have these sequestration projects to be in place, something is going to happen in the Northeast. New York is a big market. As we said, New Mexico has got a standard that they're looking at. Depending on what Canada does with the clean fuel standard that may be an option to go there. We have to see what those final rigs look like on carbon sequestration. But again, we just feel like there is going to be more of these clean fuel standards, low-carbon fuel standard in the future than they are now. So we'll see how that plays out. Paul Cheng : How about the CST supply contract on the wind generation and when that those contracts expire? Homer Bhullar : I don't think we can comment on that, unfortunately, Paul. Paul Cheng : Okay. The second question is on Mexico. Given the recent political situation look like AMLO may want to be national lines or that we emphasize the stay maybe the dominancy in some of the sector including energy. So, I mean, what is your read for the people on the ground? And is that something that will impact your expansion or that your business over there? Rich Walsh : This is Rich Walsh. Let me take an effort at answering that. I mean, I think, when we look at Mexico, first off, they would take a constitutional reform for them to really formally close out the energy sector and nationalize it. So, we don't see the political climate supporting that. If you're talking about the recent legislative reforms that Mexico is working on, those are really aimed around fuel theft and other things. If you're \u2013 if you've got a legitimate business and you're operating there as we have, I think we would be able to operate around those regulations. It is a tough regulatory environment to be there, but we're very adept at this stuff. We've moved quickly. We have our market assets on the ground there, and we're working cooperatively with the Mexican government. And we think we have a pretty good relationship with them and a good relationship with PEMEX. And so our view is that we'll be in Mexico for the long haul, and we think that it's good for the Mexican people, and we think we can help supply and solve some of their energy needs. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Paul Sankey of Sankey Research. Please proceed with your question. Paul Sankey : Hi. Good morning, everyone. The bad news is I've got eight questions. The bad news is I've got eight questions, Joe. The good news is you've answered six of them. So\u2026 Joe Gorder : We've missed you, Paul. Paul Sankey : I missed you too. One concern of clients has been imports of products into the U.S. and I guess that goes further to refining shutdowns. So could you just talk a little bit about the dynamics of, I guess, Atlantic Basin product markets? I'm just wondering whether that's a sort of dumping of gasoline that's going on and whether these refineries \u2013 what you think about refineries getting shut down because we know you guys are in the right part of the cost curve. I just wondered what your perspective is on whether or not we can rationalize some of the stuff that's kind of damaging the market, particularly into New York Harbor. And that will be it for me. Thanks, guys. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Paul. Homer Bhullar : Yes, Paul. So I think in Joe's opening comments, he mentioned we drew down 60 million barrels of light product inventory as a result of the winter storm. It put inventories very, very low in the U.S. And the low inventories really incentivized imports, especially into the East Coast. And so we've seen that record levels of imports. But you're already starting to see those odds close and the volumes of product flowing from Northwest Europe and the New York are slow. In addition to the slowing of imports, we're starting to see exports pick back up. So certainly, for us, we had exports down in the first quarter as we replenished inventories, but already in April. Our exports are starting to normalize as well. So I do think that was a short-term dynamic that will reverse as we move forward. Paul Sankey : Anything to add on refining shutdowns, the outlook? Joe Gorder : Yes, Paul. I would just say we've had a strategic outlook that says the EU, the southern refineries and Europe will continue to be under pressure, largely driven by just changes in trade flows. And then you kind of add to that the ES&G goals of the companies that they are going to continue to be under pressure. And then we also believe and continue to have a sort of an outlook that Latin American refineries are going to struggle to run a competitive utilization rates. And so that's just going to be an ongoing thing. So to the extent that that's how the Atlantic Basin tries to sort of settle up in a sort of a post-COVID universe, we'll just see how it all works. Paul Sankey : Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Todd of Simmons Energy. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple, hopefully, fairly quick, one on RNG. I mean, a number of your integrated peers have been involved in on partnerships on the RNG side. Is this something that you've looked at? Or do you view it as not fitting or competitive within your portfolio compared to the carbon capture of renewable diesel projects? And then maybe a second one, you've got the Pembroke Cogen unit and the Diamond pipeline expansion coming on into the second half of this year. There's an EBITDA range associated with those, which is reasonably wide. Any thoughts on \u2013 in the current market, what the potential EBITDA contribution would be and what the big drivers are there in the range? Rich Lashway : Okay. This is Rich Lashway. I'll take the first piece of the RNG. So we are looking at different opportunities where we can take the RNG on a kind of a booking claim basis into the refineries to generate the development fuels, which fit into the UK. So that's kind of our foray into it right now, but we still continue to look at other opportunities for RNG into kind of our supply chain to lower the carbon intensity of the products that we're producing. So we are doing it, but we're just kind of on a quieter kind of scale. Jason Fraser : As for the Pembroke Cogen, we expect to start up here at the end of the second quarter, start of the third quarter. I think our FID EBITDA was like, I want to say, US$38 million. Obviously, you had some currency risk in that. But I mean that's sort of the range in terms of what the EBITDA contribution is on an annual basis. And\u2026 Joe Gorder : Have a pipeline we don't have anything to add. Jason Fraser : Yes. That was just an optimization and the return on that, Ryan, is going to be similar to like any logistics projects. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks, gentlemen. Operator : The next question is from Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Gabelman : Yes. Hi. Good morning everyone. I wanted to ask on the refinery utilization guidance, specifically in the U.S., so excluding North Atlantic. Are you essentially running kind of at maximum levels at this point, excluding maintenance? Or are you still operating in this framework where you're trying to control or manage the supply chain? That's the first one. And the second one, just on some of the credit prices that impact renewable diesel. First, just the outlook on RINs. Do you expect prices to come off when RVOs are announced or when the small refinery exemption case is concluded? And then conversely, on LCFS prices, they've weakened recently a bit, just wondering your views on why that is and if you expect them to strengthen. Thanks. Lane Riggs : So this is Lane. I'll speak to the first question about the outlook. It's somewhat commensurate with where we are today and like all-in refining capacity is a fairly decent one. I wouldn't say we're running at max rates, but we're running above \u2013 we're running in utilization rates that were more indicative of pre-COVID levels, but they're not completely \u2013 we're not completely running at max because we are still being very careful with our supply chain. Martin Parrish : Yes. And then on the \u2013 if you talk about the RINs, the RVO will impact the D6 RINs. I talked about that earlier. Once you need to satisfy the total renewable obligation, the D4 RIN is really all about the veg oil prices in the world. So as long as they stay escalated and it's going to take at least a crop cycle to fix that, we expect the D4 RINs to stay high. On LCFS, it's off, as you stated. I think a lot of that has to do with the lockdown in California. And being from my opinion on it, you just generated less deficits out there. So you would think that the Credit Bank is going to grow marginally in this environment. But as soon as California gets back to speed here, we would expect the LCFS prices to rebound and that should be happening in the second and third quarters of this year, we would think. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Blair : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Lane, you mentioned SAF. How much SAF can DGD produce today? And if that number is low, what's the timing and cost to add in some SAF flexibility? And can you just talk in general about the economics on SAF versus RD and how you see this SAF market developing? Lane Riggs : Yes. So I'll start with the very last question you had first. Sustainable aviation fuel requires something above renewable diesel because there's yield penalties and there is capital cost or energy costs, all of the above to try to make it. So if you sort of say, hey, I can always \u2013 I have the investment to make renewable diesel, therefore, I need something additional to make sustainable aviation fuel. Today, we're not configured to make it directly. There's ways that we could make it at a big yield penalty loss. And again, that's back to the cost structure. In terms of the way we think the most economic way to produce it would require a pretty relatively expensive investment. It's essentially adding a reactor into the process and the fractionation. So there's some costs there. And those are the things that these are the projects we're trying to develop where you certainly need just \u2013 you do need some \u2013 there's people interested in small amounts here and there, and you could probably get to that with fractionation. But to do this in any meaningful way, you're going to need something to get over the hump here of requiring jet fuel to be a renewable. Matthew Blair : Great. Thank you. Operator : There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Homer Bhullar for closing remarks. Homer Bhullar : Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And obviously, if you have any follow-ups, feel free to contact the IR team. Stay safe and healthy, and have a great day. Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Homer Bhullar, Vice President Investor Relations and Finance. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's, or management's expectations, or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. Our system's flexibility and the team's relentless focus on optimization in a week, but otherwise improving margin environment enabled us to deliver positive earnings in the second quarter. More importantly, cash provided by operating activities more than covered our cash used in investing and financing activities for the quarter, even without the cash benefits from our 2020 income tax refund, and the proceeds from the sale of a portion of our interest in the Pasadena terminal. There was a significant increase in mobility in the second quarter, driving higher demand for refined products, particularly in the US. In fact, we're seeing demand for gasoline and diesel in excess of pre-pandemic levels in our US Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions. Jet demand continues to ramp up as well, and is around 80% of 2019's level. We responded with higher refinery utilization to match product demand in our system. In addition, product exports have been picking up particularly to Latin America with the easing of lockdowns in the region. We exported 410,000 barrels per day of products from our system in June, which is the highest volume since 2018. Our Renewable Diesel segment continues to perform exceptionally well and once again set records for renewable diesel margin and sales volumes, highlighting Diamond Green Diesel's ability to process a wide range of discounted feedstocks and Valero's operational and technical expertise. Our ethanol segment also performed well and provided solid operating income in the second quarter as demand for ethanol increased, along with higher gasoline production. Carbon sequestration project with BlackRock and Navigator is moving ahead and has garnered strong interest from additional parties in the binding open season. Valero is expected to be the anchor shipper with eight ethanol plants connected to this system. This project serves to help achieve our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our products, while providing solid economic returns. Our Diamond Green Diesel two project at St. Charles remains on budget and is scheduled to be operational in the middle of the fourth quarter of this year. This expansion project is expected to increase renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year bringing the total capacity at St. Charles to 690 million gallons per year of renewable diesel and 30 million gallons per year of renewable naphtha. And our Diamond Green Diesel three project at Port Arthur is also progressing well, and is now expected to be operational in the first half of 2023. With the completion of this 470 million gallons per year plant, DGD's total annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel, and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. Our refinery optimization projects remain on track with the Pembroke Cogen project expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year, and the Port Arthur Coker project expected to be completed in 2023. Looking ahead, we have a favorable outlook for refining margins, as product demand continues to improve with increasing global vaccinations and mobility. In addition, there has been significant refinery capacity rationalization in the US in the last couple of years and we expect further closures of uncompetitive refineries, particularly in Europe. We believe that product demand recovery, coupled with significant refinery rationalization should be supportive of strong refining margins. We also expect to see wider medium and heavy crude oil differentials as OPEC+ increases crude supply which should further provide support to refining margins. And as low carbon fuel policies continue to expand globally, we remain well positioned. With the current projects in progress, we expect to quadruple our renewable diesel production in the next couple of years. In addition, we continue to explore and develop opportunities in carbon sequestration, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable hydrogen and other innovative projects to strengthen our long-term competitive advantage. So with that Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks Joe. Before I provide our second quarter financial results summary, I'm pleased to inform you that we recently published an updated stewardship and responsibility report which now includes our sustainability accounting standards or SASB disclosures. In addition to being on track to achieve our previously announced target to reduce and offset 63% of our global refining greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 through investments in Board-approved projects, the report includes a new target to reduce and offset 100% of our global refining greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. These targets are consistent with our strategy as we continue to innovate and leverage our global liquid fuels platform to expand our long-term competitive advantage with investments in economic low-carbon projects. And now turning to our quarterly summary. Net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $162 million or $0.39 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.3 billion or $3.07 per share for the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $197 million or $0.48 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $504 million or $1.25 per share for the second quarter of 2020. For reconciliations to adjusted amounts please refer to the financial tables that accompany the earnings release. The Refining segment reported $349 million of operating income for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.8 billion for the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 adjusted operating income for the Refining segment was $361 million, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $383 million for the second quarter of 2020. Refining throughput volumes in the second quarter of 2021 averaged 2.8 million barrels per day which was 514,000 barrels per day higher than the second quarter of 2020. Throughput capacity utilization was 90% in the second quarter of 2021. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.13 per barrel were $0.26 per barrel lower than the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher throughput in the second quarter of 2021. The renewable diesel segment operating income was $248 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $129 million for the second quarter of 2020. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 923,000 gallons per day in the second quarter of 2021 which was 128,000 gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2020. The segment set another record for operating income and sales volumes. The ethanol segment reported operating income of $99 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $91 million for the second quarter of 2020. The second quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss was $20 million. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.2 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2021 which was 1.9 million gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2020. For the second quarter of 2021, G&A expenses were $176 million and net interest expense was $150 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $588 million and income tax expense was $169 million for the second quarter of 2021. The effective tax rate was 37% which was higher than our second quarter of 2020 primarily due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities primarily as a result of an increase in the UK statutory tax rate that will be effective in 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of $1.1 billion and our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in DGD's working capital adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $809 million. With regard to investing activities, we made $548 million of total capital investments in the second quarter of 2021 of which $252 million was for sustaining the business including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and $296 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $417 million in the second quarter of 2021. Moving to financing activities. We returned $401 million to our stockholders in the second quarter of 2021 through our dividend resulting in a payout ratio of 50% of adjusted net cash provided by the operating activities for the quarter. Earlier this month our Board of Directors also approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share payable in the third quarter. And as Joe noted, we were able to cover all of our investing and financing activities which includes our dividend and capital investments in the second quarter with cash provided by operating activities even without the benefit from the cash tax refund and the proceeds from the sale of a portion of our interest in the Pasadena terminal. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $3.6 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio net of cash and cash equivalents was 37%. At the end of June, we had $5 billion of available liquidity excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. And over half of our growth capital in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. For modeling, our third quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.6 million to 1.65 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 435,000 to 455,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 250,000 to 270,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be approximately $4.45 per barrel. With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment with the anticipated start-up of DGD two in the middle of the fourth quarter, we expect sales volumes to average one million gallons per day in 2021. Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 3.7 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.43 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the third quarter, net interest expense should be about $150 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $590 million. For 2021, we still expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $850 million and the annual effective tax rate should approximate the US statutory rate. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request the callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Please respect this request to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions, [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Gresh : Hi. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gresh : Nice job in the organic dividend coverage despite choppy refining margins here. Joe I know you touched on some of this in the opening remarks around the macro environment. June was obviously pretty tough. July is getting better here. What do you think needs to happen going forward to see sustainable improvement in margins back to more normalized levels. Is it just demand and differentials, or do we need some of these closures you were referencing in your remarks. Just any additional thoughts? Gary Simmons : Hi. Good morning, Phil. This is Gary. As you talked about -- Joe talked about mobility increasing in the second quarter. We saw good recovery in mobility in the domestic markets. And with the recovery in mobility we saw on-road transportation fuel demand basically recovered to pre-pandemic levels. The issue we really had in the second quarter was the pace of recovery in the US was just much faster than what we saw in most of the other major demand centers throughout the world. And so where our margins started to track up as demand improved eventually our market began to dislocate from the global markets and we incentivized imports. And so we saw very high levels of imports later in the quarter caused inventory to build. And as inventory built we eventually saw margin destruction. I think the good news for us as we go into the third quarter is that at least the markets we have good visibility into we're seeing mobility increase in those markets like we did in the US in the second quarter. With the increase in mobility, we're seeing demand take off quite nicely. We certainly see that in our Canadian markets in the UK and the markets we go to in Latin America. And I think that's what you really need to have sustained margin recovery is the global market -- global demand to pick up. So thus far in July, we've seen margins that are better than we saw in the second quarter, and so that's certainly encouraging. Then on the crude side you talked a little bit about the differentials. I think you noticed -- see meaningful moves and the differentials we need OPEC barrels back on the market. Of course, it was good to hear OPEC plans to put 400,000 barrels a day back out on the market sometime post-August. And I think to some degree the markets are already reflecting that. If you look at the heavy Canadian differentials in the Gulf today on the fourth quarter has about $0.75 wider discounts than what we see in the Brent market. Again that $0.75 wider discounts in the face of backwardation in the Brent market. So if you look at that discount as a percent of Brent it's a fairly meaningful move that we would see as we get later in the year. Phil Gresh : Got it. Okay. Thanks for that color. I just want to switch over to renewable diesel for the second question. The indicator margins were down sequentially obviously because of the soybean oil based indicator. Regardless you put up another record quarter there up sequentially, again, presuming from the advantaged feedstock benefit. But how do you see the sustainability of this trend? Were there any transitory factors in the quarter or structural things that you're thinking about moving forward? Martin Parrish : Hey, Phil, this is Martin. I think if you step back and just think about our renewable diesel segment, right. Our refining expertise has been a critical component to the development and operations of renewable diesel and ultimately the success of that business. You have to also keep in mind that we were an early mover in the space and have accumulated decades worth of knowledge, which is a lot more than almost all of our peers. Our operating reliability has been very good and that's helped differentiate Diamond Green. We also use the same reliability process at renewable diesel that we have applied to our refining system. And then finally structurally on the pricing Diamond Green as well as other producers, you would expect them to have stronger results when prices are going up the RIN price, ULSD price going up, because that value you see immediately and it is going to be a lag in the cost of sales on the feedstock. So with this increasing price environment helped us somewhat. Phil Gresh : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Thanks folks. Good morning. Let me also open my observations around the cash flow numbers. So we have to confirm much that. Expect to go second in the queue. All right. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. Joe, the -- or maybe Jason for this one. On the cash flow, obviously, as things improve in the second half of the year, you've shown us that the cash coverage is going to be there, but you still have the cash return commitment to investors, while your balance sheet is somewhat elevated. So can you walk us through how you will prioritize the incremental cash returns actually over the next year or so? Will the balance sheet take priority beyond dividends? That's my first question. And I have a follow-up please. Jason Fraser : Okay. Yes sure. I'll be glad to talk to you about it. As Joe said, this quarter was a big, big step change for us in a couple of ways. We've made money for the first time, and we had enough cash to cover all of our needs. So that's a great place to be in or glad to be back there again. We did put on the $4 billion of debt last year. And we have said as things normalize we will initially focus on two things : first building our cash balance back up to $3 billion-plus in that range, and then second starting to work to get our leverage down. So our June 30 cash balance was about $3.6 billion. So we're in line there. We're in a pretty good spot, and we're starting to working on the second problem, which is looking at our debt repayment. We said a few times before we would look at redeeming this tranche of three-year floaters that are callable as early as this fall. So that would likely be our first step, and that's still true. That's definitely something we're looking at. And then as we move forward further into this year and beyond that, we'll continue to look at other liability management opportunities. And as earnings and cash generation continue to normalize as you said, which is the way, we hope things continue to move, we'll have increased optionality the more cash we have. But maintaining our credit ratings is also a priority for us. And we're targeting to have a net debt to cap around three times in a normalized environment, which is consistent with where we were in the past. And we still have our long-term net debt to cap target of 20% to 30%. But to get more to your question, we also still remain committed to our capital allocation framework. Our shareholder payout ratio was 50% this quarter and we continue to target this 40% to 50% ratio on an annual basis. We do expect to be able to meet that as we move forward through the recovery and beyond even as we work on our deleveraging strategy. So we think we're going to be able to do both of them. I think it would be your answer. We're not in -- certainly not going to have to sacrifice the dividend and I don't think we'll have to sacrifice the target the 40% to 50% target either. Doug Leggate : Yes. I guess, I was thinking more about the discretionary beyond the dividend, but just that's a very full and a clear answer. So, thank you for that. Joe, I wonder if I could bring it back to you. I don't know if you want to take this or someone else but -- in your prepared remarks you talked about the perennial prospect of refinery closures ex US, I guess specifically, but these are typically triggered by capital events turnarounds things of that nature as you know for the more vulnerable refineries. I'm just wondering the fact that you were prepared to put that in your prepared remarks, do you have any particular thoughts or insights or what visibility that's giving you some comfort that it might happen this time around at an accelerated pace? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Joe Gorder : Doug, that's a good question. And I don't think we've got any particular insight that anybody else doesn't have into specific assets. I think we can all look at them and say where the vulnerabilities are. I know Lane has spoken about this many times. Just want to share your thoughts? Lane Riggs : Yes. I mean Doug how we think about it is we think about regions that have or I would say structural disadvantages, and we've talked about them before Europe, it's the -- US East Coast, the US West Coast and it's Latin America. And they all have slightly different reasons for their disadvantages. And the reason we focus on those areas is a plant job or we have operations in those areas and we try -- we think about how those areas will change over time and how we will respond to it. Obviously when we have operations in those areas, we do stress tests and we try to understand the cash flow that we -- that our assets generate through an entire economic cycle. And as you alluded to and we've said before, the things that drive assets are these big -- you start with -- you have an issue whether it's trade flow or reliability or whatever and you layer in chunky capital, whether it's regulatory capital or a big turnaround, that's when these assets really fall -- that operators start to think about what they're going to do. And as Joe said, we don't sit there -- this refinery over here or this refinery over there. We just sort of think of it regionally and where we think those issues and where closures might ultimately happen. Doug Leggate : Appreciate the answers fellows. And I assume the Valero portfolio is, I don't think that you're quite happy with it where it is. Joe Gorder : We always work very hard to make sure that we maintain our ongoing competitive advantage in all the markets that we operate. Doug Leggate : Fair answer. Thanks, both. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Our next question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe first touching on DGD again. Just in light of the very strong profitability we've been seeing for many quarters in a row, given that LCFS credit prices have seen some volatility and faltering recently, how do you see that trend going forward? And what's driving that? Martin Parrish : Hey, Theresa, this is Martin. I think one thing you have to look at is the credit bank in California, it's been pretty stable now for five quarters. But the other thing is, if you think California, we haven't seen any data from them since the end of 2020 right. So there's a lag. Tomorrow, we'll actually see the first quarter data. So you might see. But it's probably a little bit of a lack of knowledge. The credit bank being stable for the last several quarters. And then the other thing that I think you have to think about -- do we worry about that too much? Not really because if you had something that happened where there was a prolonged shift for the price of -- price went down in California, I'm pretty sure the response by CARB would be to move the goalpost to actually raise the carbon reduction targets because they had signaled several times. They're pretty content with the $200 type per ton carbon price. So we would just expect quicker carbon reduction if there was a long-term shift in that price which would then raise the price back up. Theresa Chen : Got it. That makes sense. And then, on the broader renewables front, I wanted to ask about your endeavors there. Many projects you have under development. And specifically on renewable hydrogen, what kind of projects are you planning to do there? Lane Riggs : Hi. So -- this is Lane. So what we're doing there again in our St. Charles and Port Arthur refineries, as those projects lands up to our Diamond Green Diesel projects, we look for ways to essentially make renewable hydrogen from the LPGs that come off those units and then turn to get them into an SMR that -- and then the hydrogen go backs and lowers the carbon intensity of the product out of both of those units. Theresa Chen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi Roger. Roger Read : I guess I'd like to come back maybe to the first kind of question or first discussion there with you Gary, as you were looking at the way things are improving. We've definitely seen inventories come down hard in the Europe market. And I was wondering as you look at that, as you look at the mobility improving in some of those areas, what is the -- what would be the expectation for imports over the next, I don't know let's just say, two to three months to keep it a reasonable time frame? And what that could mean for margins potentially being measurably stronger in Q3 than they were for at least the end of Q2? Gary Simmons : Yes, Roger. So I think a thing I'd point to is, they are to import gasoline from Europe, has really been closed most all of July. And so that's been encouraging to see. I think the last set of DOE data is really the first time we saw reflected in the data imports falling off. But it really has more of an impact than just the imports because we've also seen that we're again much more competitive in the Latin American markets. Not only was Europe export in the United States, but they were pushing into Latin America and causing us to lose some of the exports we typically send to that market. But as things have picked up in Europe, they're not only, not sending barrels to the US, but we're seeing our exports ramp up in the Latin America. So what I would say is more normalization of trade flows, which will help inventories, continue to draw and support better crack spreads. Roger Read : Great. Thanks. And then the other question a little off the typical beaten path here. But you're, obviously, moving aggressively more expansions in renewable diesels we've seen. Lot of talk about sustainable aviation fuel as one of the areas, I was just curious is there anything you're looking at in that front? Are the economics of sustainable aviation as attractive as renewable diesel as you look at them? And then what would be the, I guess to some extent interchangeability between renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel? Martin Parrish : Yeah. So this is Martin. If you look at that Roger to make renewable jet or SAF, you have to have some additional equipment. I mean there's a few ways to do it but you're either going to add -- you're probably going to add a reactor and you're certainly going to add the fractionator. So that's additional capital. And then that once your yield pattern changes a little bit where you make some more light ends. So at the end of the day to get back to equal to renewable diesel, you're going to have to get some help on the SAF side with some additional pricing mechanism and additional green premium there. So right now we don't see the economic incentive to make SAF. That being said, obviously, we're studying it. We're looking at everything. We're looking how the landscape changes once going through in all parts of the world and legislative processes or regulatory processes. So we'll keep watching it. And we fully expect to be making it at some point. So I don't think it's a question of if but it's more about when. Roger Read : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Sam Margolin : Hi everybody. How are you doing? Joe Gorder : Hi Sam. Sam Margolin : My first question is for Martin. If I could ask you to go into a little bit more detail about that yield comment you made at DGD just given the per gallon value of all the different credits flowing in a yield outcome is very powerful. So if you're able to can you just give a more detail around that and how sustainable it is and whether how far off sort of your plans you are in terms of yield outcomes and production efficiency? Martin Parrish : Well, Sam, I wouldn't say our yield is right on track with what we expect. The -- and it's really not so much the yield, it's more just about the timing. We've been in a market with a huge increase in ULSD price, a huge increase in the RIN in the year-to-date and fat price has also been up but you had a bigger escalation in the RIN than you've had in the fat price. And we've also been helped by the discount. Our feedstocks by running 100% waste feedstocks, we're certainly buying at a price significantly lower than soybean oil. So what I'm saying on the timing is just in a rising market like that you're going to immediately see the ULSD price and your revenue you're going to immediately see the RIN price. And there's just a lag in the feedstock, price and hitting cost of goods sold. So you're going to see a little better margin environment in a rising prices. Lane Riggs : Hi, Sam. This is Lane. I'll add to it a little bit. We have been working with catalyst suppliers in terms of improving the yield of the current units and essentially trying to maximize renewable diesel versus LPG versus naphtha and versus some of the off gases. So we have seen our yields improving over the life of our over all operating experience from 2013 till\u2026 Sam Margolin : Okay, understood. Thank you. And then Joe in your prepared remarks you had a comment about light-heavy differentials potentially bottoming and starting to expand here as OPEC volumes come back. I think I'm still looking at the sulfur penalty. It's still very wide. Is there a signal around high-sulfur fuel oil discounts and what that means for when actual supply of sour expands? Is the expansion of that advantage going to be faster than normal, or are you still thinking about it as the normal relationship between supply versus differentials? Joe Gorder : No. I think some of the movement you've seen in high sulfur fuel, really two primary drivers on high-sulfur fuel discounts. One just the prospect of getting more OPEC barrels onto the markets caused high-sulfur fuel oil to weaken some. And then some changes in the tax policies in China had caused them to kick out some high-sulfur fuel blend stocks, which caused high-sulfur fuel to move weaker. Today it's one of the more economic feedstocks we're running in our system, high sulfur fuel and high-sulfur fuel blend stocks is one of the highest margin feeds we have in our system today. And we expect that to continue. Sam Margolin : Okay. Thanks everybody. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Yeah. Good morning, everyone. The first question here is just -- it's probably for Martin on the ethanol side. You had strong results at that business segment. Can you just talk about what you think the sustainability of this ethanol recovery is? And the moving pieces from feedstock to product prices? Martin Parrish : Sure, Neil. Yes, I mean, second quarter was obviously really good. And if you look at the weekly inventory debt in the second quarter what was happening through most of the quarter is the inventories just kept drawing. And typically when inventories draw you're going to get a better margin. And it's pretty good correlation there in the U.S. ethanol industry. So when we -- but the weekly data now in June starting into May and through June, we've seen that turn the other way. So margins now are lower than they were in the second quarter. How long is this going to last? I'm not sure. We're starting to see some run cuts in the industry now. We've signaled some lower guidance for third quarter on runs versus what we did in second quarter. So we'll see where it turns. I mean, really what we're looking at long term though in ethanol is carbon sequestration. And we feel like that is going to differentiate us from the industry between the 45Q tax credit that's worth about $0.15 a gallon getting into LCFS markets that's more like $0.50 a gallon gross. So we're well positioned there with what we're doing with Navigator and BlackRock and then we're also looking at some stand-alone projects that are Eastern ethanol plants for carbon sequestration. So that's really our endgame is to lower the carbon intensity of a product and stay competitive there and differentiate ourselves. Neil Mehta : Yeah. No, that's great. And as a follow-up, it's just a big picture question. And I don't know if this is for Joe or Lane, but if I think about the demand side of the equation for both gasoline and diesel has come back really nicely. Obviously, we're still waiting here on Global Jet. Margins until recently didn't perform it just strikes us that the refining system in the United States was running too hard ahead of product. Do you believe that discipline in the U.S. refining system has broken-down? Or do you see that as still a structural tailwind for the space that independent, refiners will generally run at relatively low levels of utilization relative to demand enabling favorable inventories. It's a big picture question but one of the structural benefits certainly of the refiners over the last couple of years has been the discipline around runs? Lane Riggs : Yeah. So Neil, this is Lane. What I'd say is independent refiners, will be much more disciplined than the industry was a decade ago. And it's just because we -- at the end of the day we have to manage our assets to cash flow and to make money. I think what you've seen there was a clear signal in April and May to raise utilization. It was a big -- the markets we're signaling that. What really happened and Gary talked about it earlier is it was just a bug, right? I mean, the U.S. recovered with the -- we were out -- our mobility had gone way up and it attracted imports from areas that were still essentially in lockdown. So you had surplus capacity in Europe and some of these other places that attracted imports. I wouldn't say that the United States was -- refining industries have gotten lack of discipline. It was our operating further signals. It was really the main issue that we have -- we had -- there's capacity out there that essentially could get pointed to the U.S. and some earlier caller mentioned the European fundamentals look better. So today what you're seeing is even though margins are up, we're not really -- yards close to the United States coming out of Europe. Neil Mehta : Excellent. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Hey guys. Good morning. Lane Riggs : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : A couple of quick questions, maybe this is for Gary. Gary, Mexico the recent action by AMLO does it cause any concern from you guys standpoint? And whether you will slow down your investment in the near-term to take away and see how hits you? Or that you think it's just, continue to be business as usual when you were pushed forward? And with the -- maybe elimination or cancels large number of the import and export lines and have you seen the market dynamic change there? So that's the first question. The second question is for Lane. Just curious, I mean you guys and the industry have done a remarkable job in changing the -- or that to use the flexibility of the system, refining system to one different type of crude over the last several years, even for Gulf Coast heavy oil refiner ship substantially more to the light. And during the pandemic, substantially reduced jet fuel and even this will then trying to get into gasoline. But a lot of time that deviated from the design standard model. So along that way while it's doable, have you seen any inefficiency or any course create as such that, the margin capture become maybe perhaps a bit more soft? Thank you. Gary Simmons : Okay. Paul I'll start. And if Rich Walsh wants to add anything to it, I'll let him on Mexico. Really our strategy is unchanged. The one thing I would say is we're not really investing in Mexico. We partnered with IEnova and others that are really making those investments and then we signed long-term agreements to utilize the assets that they're investing in. But overall I think the strategy that we're using in Mexico is what they had intended when they started energy reform. They wanted to see investment in infrastructure in their country. And a lot of others are really not doing. They've kind of taking advantage of the legislation. We are investing in the country. And I think what we are doing in Mexico is exactly what was intended with the change in the regulation. So our strategy is still very much intact. Veracruz is fully operational now. We have our terminal in Mexico City it was commissioned during the second quarter. We will commission our terminal in Puebla in the third quarter. We've also started to bring jet fuel into Veracruz and we'll start jet fuel sales in the third quarter as well. So things are going very well for us in Mexico. And Rich I don't know if you want to add anything? Rich Walsh : I think that sums it up. Lane Riggs : And Paul to answer your second question, the industry did I think at least particularly we \u2013 I would say, Valero learned a lot going into the pandemic in terms of how to operate our refineries may be differently and actually demonstrated more flexibility as you would expect us to figure out how to operate. I think in terms of margin capture what you'll see is you coming out of it is going into it we had contango, right? So as you \u2013 there was structural contango in the crude markets and as we're coming out of it we've gone flat to slight backwardation. So I think what you'll see kind of moving ahead you have a combination of slight backwardation and obviously high flat price will cause some of the byproducts to maybe have some margin capture \u2013 will affect margin capture. It doesn't really affect so much our ability to generate EBITDA as much as when you think of in terms of market capture. In terms of anything that's happened post pandemic, if anything we just learned a lot more about how to manage our business even more carefully than we had before. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our question is coming from Manav Gupta of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. Manav Gupta : Hey, guys. Just first want to congratulate Mr. John Locke and Homer for their promotions and wish them all the luck for all the new responsibilities they're taking within Valero. And I also wanted to congratulate you Joe. We know the capital discipline and shareholder returns are two strong pillars on which you have built this new Valero. So it was personally very important for you to achieve full dividend coverage. And so congrats on getting there despite a tough macro. Joe Gorder : Yes. No. Thanks, Manav. And John and Homer are both going to need a lot of luck. Manav Gupta : My quick question here is Lane or Joe is we have seen North Atlantic here actually sometimes outperform your Mid-Con do very strong. And this quarter came in a little weaker. I'm hoping it was just a turnaround and it's nothing to do with that one of the refineries that is located in Europe and Canada and just if you could give us some color on why North Atlantic was slightly weaker quarter-over-quarter? Lane Riggs : Yes. So you actually \u2013 you hit the main issue. Both refineries were actually in turnaround in the second quarter. The results were affected by that. Manav Gupta : Okay. Thank you for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe one on \u2013 you announced that you moved up the timing of the Diamond Green Diesel Phase 3 start-up from the second half to the first half of 2023. What's allowed you to accelerate that? And maybe can you talk about the general environment out there. I think most people probably would have taken that over for most of the capacity expansion start dates out there I guess within that overall environment what are you seeing that's allowing you to kind of execute better than expected on your projects? Martin Parrish : Sure. This is Martin. I think one thing you have to remember now is DGD 3 is pretty much a carbon copy of DGD 2. So that helped us. I mean all the major equipment we changed a little bit but just tweaks. So we had a lot of the engineering done sooner than you typically would have. Now obviously, we knew that when we funded it but just getting out the market while steel prices and everything were up we kind of beat all that to the market. So we had placed orders before that happened. The delivery is good. I mean the shop space is there and the labor situation is really good on the Gulf Coast, where we're building. So all those things and then just having an experience we moved over experienced contractors from DGD 2 that had just built one of these units. So all the work, the structural work, the concrete work structural steel is already going up. So we just got a really quick start out of the gates and we expect to be able to maintain that. So in a nutshell that set an experienced construction team and getting out in front of these price increases and shop space has been really good for us. Lane Riggs : This is Lane. I want to emphasize what Martin has said. I mean part of what we're able to do here is it's not just really in this space but we have a really good project execution group. And they just \u2013 we're in the process of building Diamond Green 2 and we learn and it's actually accelerated and brought in, it's scheduled. So we just took all that and transferred into Diamond Green 3. And this just sort of speaks to our capability to not only operate well but we can execute projects very well and in this not just in our refinery space but also in the renewable diesel space. Ryan Todd : Thanks a lot. Congratulations on it's pretty impressive though. Maybe a type question on RINs and RVO. I mean there's been obviously a lot of noise lately a lot of volatility in those markets following the Supreme Court's ruling on SREs and with the upcoming RVO. Any -- with yourselves involved now in a pretty material way on both sides of the issue, on the gasoline side and on the biofuel side, any thoughts as we head into -- how you think the EPA is going to try to balance things or how you're looking at the market playing out with RVOs in the over the next couple of years? Rich Walsh : This is Rich Walsh. I'll take a crack at that. There is a lot of noise on this, but when you really sort it all out, it comes down to EPA is going to have to issue these RVOs. They're clearly are kicking them out to get past a lot of the infrastructure discussion and not to have this issue rear up in the middle of their efforts to try to push forward the infrastructure deal. So we would expect that once you kind of clear this EPA is going to have to issue an RVO. We're almost all the way through 2021. By the time they could get a rule posed and out, the year is almost going to -- almost certainly be passed it. So you're looking at maybe 2021-2022 combined rule or at least them coming out at the same time. And I think that will -- and the other reality is they recognize that they need to set an RVO that's achievable and obtainable. So we expect them to do that. On the SREs, the Supreme Court ruling really focused on only one issue was appealed up and that was on these continuity of the SRE ruling. The other aspects of the Tenth Circuit ruling that kick those SREs back to EPA are still there and EPA has got them back under. And they haven't issued an SRE, since 2018. So I think the prospect for SREs probably doesn't really change with the Supreme Court ruling and the EPA still got a whole host of other issues that they have to sort through that came out of the Tenth Circuit ruling that was -- that still stands. And so how do you guess what's going to happen on this. I mean, the reality is they've just got a set attainable and achievable mandate and that's what they'll have to do. Ryan Todd : All right. I appreciate the comments. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering Holt. Please go ahead. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning. I want to follow-up on Martin's response on the LCFS question. Martin, I think you said that you expect CARB to move the goalpost to keep credit prices around $200 a ton. So just two follow-ups on that. One, mechanically, do you know how that would work? Does CARB have unilateral authority to do something like that, or do they need legislative approval, or is there like a public common period. And then two, what would you expect the refiner response to be if that happened? Just thinking about Valero, you have two refineries in the states that are incurring LCFS costs. There's some other refineries in the state that currently don't have RD production. So, is that something that refiners would fight, could they fight it? Any more color there? Martin Parrish : Well, what's different in with the CARB regulations and with the LCFS to answer your last question first. That obligation goes down to the racks so that the price is passed on for the refiner in California which is a contrast to the way the RFS works. So that's -- I wouldn't expect to see a fight from the refiners on that. The other question is more interesting. CARB has -- there's been several statements out there about moving the goalpost. To answer your specific question, I'm not sure I can what is required there. We want to be a little looking into that. But my understanding is they have the ability to do that, we'll have to check on that. Joe Gorder : Yeah. I mean that's\u2026 Matthew Blair : Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll leave it there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Gabelman : Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask on 2Q, two aspects that could have been transitory. First, on biofuel blending and there was some thought that maybe blending biofuels instead of buying RINs, minimizes the cost of RINs you incur, but it's unclear if the actual sales and costs flow that way or not. So can you just kind of elaborate on if you're still seeing the same benefit from blending as you historically have and that it avoids having to go out and buy out RINs, or are you incurring some costs at a similar time to go and buy RINs? And then the second question also on kind of transitory items on the coproduct impacts on 2Q. Are those headwinds dissipating and turning into tailwinds as oil prices are declining, or are different products moving in different ways? Thanks. Joe Gorder : I think on your first question, whether you're out buying the RIN or doing the blending you're kind of achieving the same thing. So the market price is -- price of the RIN is what it is. So either way, I'd say you get to the same result. Lane Riggs : Yes. On the second question there are byproducts that we make in the refineries that don't move lockstep with crude price things like asphalt, pet coke, sulfur, LPGs and the long haul they do. It takes it longer in other words once crude moves up or moves down have the tendency to sort of take longer to get to their equilibrium state with crude. So you'd expect it for whatever reason if crude prices were down those would improve. I don't know that -- we don't -- we're not speculating that crude prices will be down for the entire quarter. But that is how it works. Jason Gabelman : Sorry, can I just follow up on that first answer quickly. Is that to say there's no real benefit from going out on blending biofuels versus buying RINs? Because I was under the assumption that if you're blending biofuels, your side stepping buying RINs and there's kind of an embedded benefit in doing that? Joe Gorder : Well I would say there's a benefit right? I mean you can't -- I mean obviously, everybody just can't buy RINs you're going to have to move the biofuels too. So certainly we're looking at both sides of that equation. But if the market is functioning properly and people are certainly you're -- there's people that have to meet obligations. So you're going to have some blending and in a properly functioning market. I'm just saying, you're don't to get to the same place but you're going to do both. Jason Gabelman : All right. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. At this time I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Bhullar, for closing comments. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Donna. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Please stay safe and healthy and feel free to contact the IR team, if you have any additional questions. Have a great day, everyone. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Operator Instructions]. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Homer Bhullar, Vice President of Investor Relations & Finance. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO, Lane Riggs, our President and COO, Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO, Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President & Chief Commercial Officer, and several other members of Valero Senior Management Team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the Company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under Federal Securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Homer. And good morning, everyone. We saw significant improvement in refining margins globally in the third quarter as economic activity in mobility continued to recover in key markets. Finding margins were supported by strong recovery in product demand, coupled with product inventories falling to low levels during the quarter. In fact, total U.S. light product inventories are now at 5-year lows, and total light product demand is over 95% of the 2019 level. Across our system, current gasoline sales are at 95% of the 2019 level, and diesel sales are 10% higher than in 2019. And on the crude oil side, medium and heavy sour crude oil differentials widened during the quarter as OPEC+ increased supply. Hurricane Ida resulted in some downtime at our St. Charles in Miro refineries and the Diamond Green Diesel Plant. We immediately deployed emergency teams and supplies after the storm to help our employees, their families, and the surrounding communities in the restoration and recovery effort. The affected facilities did not sustain significant damage from the storm and once power and utilities were restored, the plants were successfully restarted. I'm very proud of our team's efforts in the ability to safely shutdown and restart our operations. Despite the impacts of the hurricane, we also completed the Diamond Green Diesel expansion project, DGD 2. In the third quarter, ahead of schedule, and on-budget and are in the process of starting up the new unit. DGD 2 increases renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year, bringing DGD's total renewable diesel capacity to 690 million gallons per year. In addition, we successfully completed and started up the new Pembroke Cogeneration unit in the third quarter. Which is expected to provide an efficient and reliable source of electricity and steam and further enhance the refineries competitiveness. Looking ahead, the DGD 3 project at our Port Arthur refinery continues to progress and is still expected to be operational in the first half of 2023. With the completion of these 470 million gallons per year plan, DGGS total annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel, and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. The large-scale carbon sequestration project with BlackRock and Navigator is also progressing on schedule. Navigator has received the necessary board approvals to proceed with the carbon capture pipeline system, as a result of a successful binding open season. Valero is expected to be the anchor shipper with 8 ethanol plants connected to this system, which should provide a higher ethanol product margin, uplift. The Port Arthur Coker project, which is expected to increase the refineries utilization rate and improved turnaround efficiency, is still expected to be completed in 2023. On the financial side, we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, which prioritizes a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. We redeemed the entire outstanding principal amount of our $575 million floating rate senior notes due in 2023 in the third quarter. And we ended the quarter well-capitalized with 3.5 billion of cash and 5.2 billion of available liquidity excluding cash. Looking ahead, we continue to have a favorable outlook on refining margins as a result of low global product inventories, continued demand recovery, and global balances supported by the significant refinery capacity rationalization seen over the last year-and-a-half. In addition, the expected high natural gas prices in Europe and Asia through the winter should further support liquid fuels demand as power generation facilities, industrial consumers, and petrochemical producers see incentives to switch from natural gas to refinery oil products for feed stock and energy needs. Continued improvement in earnings of our core refining business, coupled with the ongoing expansion of our renewable\u2019s businesses, should strengthen our competitive advantage and drive long-term shareholder returns. So, with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the third quarter of 2021, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $463 million or $1.13 per share compared to a net loss of $464 million or $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020. Third quarter 2021 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $500 million or $1.22 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $472 million or $1.16 per share for the third quarter of 2020. For reconciliations to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that acCompany the earnings release. The refining segment reported 835 million of operating income for the third quarter of 2021 compared to a 629 million operating loss for the third quarter of 2020. Third quarter 2021 adjusted operating income for the refining segment was 853 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of 575 million for the third quarter of 2020. Refining throughput volumes in the third quarter of 2021 averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 338,000 barrels per day, higher than the third quarter of 2020. Throughput capacity utilization was 91% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 80% in the third quarter of 2020. Refining cash, operating expenses of $4.53 per barrel were $0.27 per barrel higher than the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. The renewable diesel segment operating income was 108 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to 184 million for the third quarter of 2020. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 671,000 gallons per day in the third quarter of 2021, which was 199,000 gallons per day lower than the third quarter of 2020. The lower operating income and sales volumes in the third quarter of 2021 are primarily attributed to plant downtime due to Hurricane Ida. The ethanol segment reported a 44 million operating loss for the 3rd quarter of 2021 compared to 22 million of operating income for the 3rd quarter of 2020. Excluding the adjustments shown in the acCompanying earnings release tables, third quarter 2021 adjusted operating income was 4 million compared to 36 million for the third quarter of 2020. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.6 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2021, which was 175 thousand gallons per day lower than the third quarter of 2020. For the third quarter of 2021 G&A expenses were $195 million and net interest expense was $152 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $641 million and income tax expense were $65 million for the third quarter of 2021. The effective tax rate was 11%, which reflects the benefit from the portion of DGD's net income that is not taxable to us. Net cash provided by operating activities was 1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2021. Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of 379 million and our joint venture partners, 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel, net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was 1 billion. With regard to investing activities, we made 585 million of total capital investments in the third quarter of 2021. Of which 191 million was for sustaining the business including costs for turnarounds, catalyst, and regulatory compliance, and 394 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments, attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were 392 million in the third quarter of 2021. Moving to financing activities, we returned $400 million to our stockholders in the third quarter of 2021 through our dividend, resulting in a payout ratio of 40% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were 14.2 billion and cash and cash equivalents were 3.5 billion. And as Joe mentioned earlier, we redeemed the entire outstanding principal amount of our 575 million floating rate senior notes due in 2023 in the third quarter. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 37%, and at the end of September, we had 5.2 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance, we still expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately 2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts, and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. And over 60% of our growth capital in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.67 to 1.72 million barrels per day, Mid-continent at 455 to 475 thousand barrels per day, West Coast at 230 to 250 thousand barrels per day, and North Atlantic at 435 to 455 thousand barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $4.70 per barrel. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to average 1 million gallons per day in 2021. Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.2 million gallons per day in the 4th quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.43 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the fourth quarter, net interest expense should be about a $150 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $600 million. For 2021, we still expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $850 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again, respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than 2 questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Please respect this request to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hi, Joe and team. Morning Homer, thanks for getting on the call [Indiscernible]. Joe, I want to start with a balance sheet question and then a macro question if I may. So, this might be for Jason, but when you think forward to 2022, you've obviously completed the renewable diesel expansion at this point, your capital this year, you obviously had growth capital in there still, and your balance sheet is still probably above where you'd like to see at mid-cycle, how should we be thinking about Capex and prioritizing the right level of debt or balance sheet that you'd like to have as we think about 2022? Joe Gorder : Go ahead, Jason. Jason Fraser : Okay. Yeah, On Capex, I mean, our Capex budget going forward, we're forecasting to be pretty consistent with -- as we've done in the past so really no change there. And as we end up with extra as you said, excess cash flow that -- we have our commitment to shareholders to return the 40% to 50% that really hasn't changed. We have our dividend which we think is in a pretty good place relative to the peers. And then we will have buybacks to make up to our target and then cash beyond that, we are going to look at delivering a bit, that's a commitment we made. We bought back to 575 of floating rate notes and just last month. And we're looking to do more next week. I mean, sorry, next year, as it moves forward. Doug Leggate : We would you like that to be Jason, I guess is my point. Where do you want net debt-to-cap to be? Jason Fraser : But we hadn't changed what we have in our frameworks to 20, 30%. So, we hadn't changed that, but we're definitely working down from where we are now. I don't know that we've changed our -- the endpoint at this time. Doug Leggate : Okay. Thank you. Joe my macro question is really, I want to try and phrase it like this. There's a ton of moving parts, for you guys in particular with top-line reversing and obviously OPEC+ adding back oil and all the rest of it. So, you got spread side of it. And then you go the product side of it with jet-fuel perhaps being the missing link. Maybe the simplest way to ask this question is do you see for Valero 2022 at this point from what you know, as an above mid cycle year on a below mid-cycle year in terms of EBITDA, I'll leave it there. Thanks. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Doug. Gary Simmons : Hey Doug, this is Gary. I would tell you, on the demand side of the equation, our view of 2022 has been fairly consistent. We see gasoline and diesel demand recurring -- returning to pre -pandemic levels. Our view is jet -- it probably is the latter part of the year before jet demand recovers to pre -pandemic levels. The real change on 2022 is coming from the fact that inventories are just so low. Inventories domestically are low, but globally they are low as well. And when you look at the fourth quarter turnaround activity, it's difficult for us to see that we're going to replenish clean product inventories before next year. And so going into next year with inventories low, we're starting to move to a view that we can see some fairly strong crack spreads. I think in addition to that, the high-cost natural gas also comes into play. When you look at places around the world that are paying $30 a million BTU for natural gas, it pressures that refining capacity and kind of raises the incremental crack spreads needed for them to run, which also pushes margins higher. So, I would tell you that we probably came in looking at 2022 slightly below mid-cycle and it's trending now more above mid-cycle type levels. Doug Leggate : Appreciate the answers, guys. We'll talk to you in a couple of weeks. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : Hi, there. Good morning, everyone. Joe Gorder : Morning, Theresa. Theresa Chen : Thanks for taking my question, morning. Gary, I wanted to follow up on your comments about the natural gas pressures internationally, and clearly, we're seeing some of it domestically as well. So first maybe just on the competitive dynamics between domestic and refiners elsewhere, Europe, for example, how does -- how do you think this affects the competitive positioning of your assets, and where do you see that export or potentially going to? Gary Simmons : Well, that's a good question. I guess might ask for some lane help here. Natural gas is what about 25% of our OpEx? Joe Gorder : I'll [Indiscernible] Gary Simmons : Yeah. So, you kind of figure $4 a barrel and a dollar and that's natural gas. And if you're paying $30 versus 5, you can see what that does for overall refinery cash operating expenses, which does give us a very significant advantage into those export markets. We're seeing that today. You're not seeing much flow from Europe into those Latin American markets, and we're seeing a big pull into those markets. Theresa Chen : Got it. And maybe, switching gears a little bit, I would love to get an update on your outlook on renewable diesel economics. As DGD 2 is now starting up, and specifically, it looks like LCFS prices have hit a trough and now are seeing some signs of life consistent with Martin's previous expectations. Is this largely because of demand recovery or petroleum products in California beginning to higher deficit generation? Is there something else going on here? Would love it if Martin can look into his crystal ball again and give us a sense of where prices could go from here. Martin Parrish : Okay, Theresa. This is Martin, I'll give that a shot. I think, yeah, we've seen the LCFS prices rebound $1.75 a metric ton now. I think some of that's due to the expectation to game the second half data out. Second quarter of '21 data will be published at the end of the month, but if you go back and look, it's really obvious the deficits after 2019, just stopped increasing. And at that time, the carbon reduction goal was moving from 6.25% to 7.5% to 8.75%. So historically each year you'd see a step change in deficits, we've seen nothing happen since 2019. and credits are keeping up with deficits and the credit bank is flat. So that kind of explains why the pricing went away. It's not an over generation of credits, it's the lack of deficits. It's clear. And I think with the Delta variant now, hopefully, in the rear-view mirror and mobility improving, we would expect to see some pretty big changes in the deficit picture in California, going forward. And I think that's what the market is beginning to expect. As far as the renewable diesel economics, the DGD, as we signaled, we expected the margins to moderate versus the record margins in the first half of 2021. Part of this is DGD 2 getting into the marketplace. We're impacting the waste feed stock market at this point because we're changing the flows and any time you change the flows and change the inertia of the market, you're going to see a temporary increase in price. Once the new flows work through the market, we expect those prices to moderate, and go back to what we always talk about, the annual margins. We've been very consistent the past 3 years. Our annual margins only move from 218 a gallon to 237 a gallon in that 3-year period, and we believe that margin history is a good indication of what to expect in the future. Theresa Chen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read : Yeah, good morning, everybody. Joe Gorder : Hey, Roger. Roger Read : Just, uh -- let's go ahead and beat the natural gas horse hear completely to death. I know you've got cogen plant that helps you sort of mitigate things a little bit over in Europe. As you step back and look at both your operations and think about it, you were somebody else, what are the options for mitigation of higher natural gas costs? I mean, do you hedge -- do you think others hedge? Another way to come at it is mentioned in the intro. Joe, I think you said was, probably demand for some other liquid products. So, what are the -- some of the ratios we should think about there is to how that could pull additional product demand and what are, maybe, the trigger points for why you would do that over natural gas? Lane Riggs : Hey, Roger. This is Lane. So, I'll take a shot at some of these. One is, yeah, we do have completed our [Indiscernible] project over on Pembroke and so you'd sort of ask yourself, \"Hey, a $30 gas. Does this still even work? \" And it does. I mean our FID economics on that unit was about $105,000 a day of benefit, and today we're somewhere between $130 to $150,000 a day and it just has to do with the -- who the marginal supplier of electricity in that market versus an the efficient cogen. So that's where we have that margin that we have running it and it does help. Now a lot of people in the U.K. a lot of those guys rather have cogens as well, I don't know how efficient they are, because that's where these relative economics lie. Is how efficient your cogen is versus the marginal guy in that market. Because as Gary alluded to earlier, what you're seeing is you need margin in the Atlantic Basin because of the call on their capacity to essentially run oil and satisfy the market. So, what that means is Europe and UK are going to be very marginal in their economics, but that gives a bit -- that gives a substantially larger margin to people on this side of the Atlantic. In terms of ways to mitigate it through hedging or is a few ways, one is in just minimize gas. You can start burning propane, you can do other things, most of our refineries for their complexity, we're long gas, so we can always get into a place where we are essentially deriving our natural gas requirements from oil. And so, we played out arbitrage and signal around and try to see where that is. And the other thing is use option strategy. You know, you can go out and buy coal options for gas and in various ways of using options to mitigate your exposure. And then, obviously you can go out and buy before contract. I don't know how many people do that. It's an interesting question. And we look at it all the time and we compare -- you know, we look a little bit at his insurance because it's not free, right? And so, you have to take a view of my trying to use this to lower my exposure from a cost perspective, and my trying to -- my trying to prevent a shock incident. In other words, something like we saw during winter storm Yuri or something like that. So, you have to sort of frame -- what are you trying to do here? Because it isn't free. And if it doesn't translate into something that costs for somebody our size, that that being just additional operating cost, we essentially paid his insurance. And so, you have other ways to do it. You can decide to fix or float as you're getting closer towards the end of the month. There's a lot of tools in our tool bag to mitigate this but at the end of the day, to try to lock in lower prices going forward, it's almost always structural contango. If you look in the curve right now, it's kind of crazy looking, and so everybody's staring at this because you can see the futures activity in the first quarter. And so, it's difficult, but we do have tools to do that. Joe Gorder : Did you speak to fuel switching? Roger Read : Great, thanks. Lane Riggs : I did, I mean that's why I was saying we can -- we fuel switch. Joe Gorder : Propane. Yeah, okay. Lane Riggs : Mainly propane, but we also made gas from our operations. Joe Gorder : Okay. Roger Read : Thanks. On the -- let's look at it from a happier standpoint, the product demand side, it appears jet fuel should get a lift with some of the international travel restrictions coming off next month. And then we obviously have supply chain issues in trucking. I was just curious. You mentioned earlier that it looked like diesel demand was up versus 19 levels. Do you think there's another lift up, focused on logistics, and just general trucking demand? And then how do you see the jet fuel demand picture? Hopefully, improving as we get into year-end. Jason Fraser : Yes, so Roger, I think there is a good chance -- some upside to diesel. We've seen good harvest demand. A lot of it depends on the fourth quarter, what happens in weather, but specifically on the trucking side, still a lot of companies struggling to find drivers to drive the trucks and get products moved around. So, I think, as we worked through that and get drivers back to work, there is a chance that you'd see more highway demand for diesel. Which is encouraging. On the jet side, we saw a nice step change in the third quarter. We were trending 71%, 72% of 2019 levels and that jumped into the 80s. So that's nice to see. At that level, you're kind of overall total. Product demand is about 300,000 barrels a day below where it was in 2019. But you've got 675,000 barrels a day less refining capacity. So already, you're really tighter supply, demand balance is, at least, domestically, than we were pre -pandemic. And then we are seeing encouraging signs on the jet side. You look, we don't have a lot of transparency there, but the nominations that we're seeing from the airlines that we supply, seemed to show that they are anticipating a pretty heavy holiday travel season and so we would expect an uptake there with jet demand. Roger Read : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phil Gresh : Yeah. Good morning. Just following up on the last commentary around the domestic supply demand picture, how are you thinking about the export markets right now? It seems like the Brazilian demand is really starting to pick up from recent data points. So just in general, what are you seeing and then how do you think about the competitive dynamics in those export markets given the situation with European refineries right now? Gary Simmons : Yeah, so I would tell you that, you know, our export demand has returned to pre -pandemic levels. Very good mobility in Latin America, and we're seeing very strong export demand on the diesel side, the same type thing, very good export demand and the arb to Europe is swinging kind of open and closing pull to Europe as well. So again, trade flows seem to have completely normalized to where they were pre -pandemic. Phil Gresh : Got it. Okay. And then, my second question is just, there's been a lot of discussion of the impact of higher natural gas on European refineries, and the effect it's had on crack spread, so if we were to see a scenario or natural gas prices were to come back down in Europe, do you feel like the underlying diesel crack would still be stronger than where it was before all this happened just because of underlying demand improvements or, just curious how we should think about that? Martin Parrish : Yeah. So, I suspect you would see some falloff in the crack spread as natural gas weakened, however, the inventory situation will continue to keep and support crack spreads. It looks to us, especially in Europe, even if they ramp up utilization, and you look at where demand is versus the inventory draw that's been trending, it's going to be very difficult for Europe to really replenish their stocks and as long as that's the case, we would expect it to support the cracks. Phil Gresh : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Prashant Rao of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Prashant Rao : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask first on -- just little bit on the capital allocation policy. Given the commentary around EBITDA being -- looking like, it could be little bit above mid-cycle next year and what you said about giving it a comfortable place on the dividend and looking to maintain your capital allocation framework. I'm just curious how DGDs earnings can, specifically the distributions from [Indiscernible] fit into that? I think many of us have been expecting, maybe the distributions up for the partners come later. Given that you've got Capex on DGD 3 coming and that project is set for 2023 start, but is that a factor on how you think about potentially putting more money back to shareholders and specifically to the dividend? Or is the distribution not really that material versus the other sources of cash flow that you have? Jason Fraser : Okay, this is Jason I can take a shot. And you're right, it's definitely a positive development and going to get bigger and bigger as the DGDs more units come online. So, it is significant, it doesn't change our math on how we look at it, we get half of the distributions and that's cash into us and we still acquire 40% to 50% target in our normal analysis in that aspect, but it's definitely a growing [Indiscernible] EBITDA to us it's very -- excited about and will help us going forward. Prashant Rao : Thanks, Jason. I wanted to ask about something we haven't touched on yet, Ethanol and CCUs Project, good progress there. Couple of questions here in one, how soon could you FID or what do you need to see to be able to roll in the remainder of the footprint in to a CCS project and then up from a macro standpoint or I guess from more of a revenue standpoint, we've got some news about 45 queue increases for certain increase -- for certain industries. We've also got some volatility around the RFS and what that means for overall ethanol demand and support from the government for ethanol blending. I was just wondering if the second part of the question, if you could address how those -- all those factors might affect your thoughts about the project. Thanks. Martin Parrish : Yeah, Prashant, this is Martin. Well, we're operating 12 ethanol plants now. 8 of them are going into the navigator system. And the ones on the eastern side -- the four on the eastern side, we're moving forward with sequestration plans at three of the four. And potentially all of them a little bit down the road, but the geology on the eastern side of the U.S. -- so this is Indiana and Ohio, is the Eastern side of the [Indiscernible] I should say, is good for CCUS. So, we're planning to do sequestration at the -- actually on-site. So now that's going through our gated process, and still hurdles to get through there. But that's the plan. So that's where we're headed on that. And we're excited about CCUS. as you stated, the 45Q is an uplift of about $0.15 a gallon and just on a gross basis. The Low Carbon getting to a 40ci versus 70s worth almost $0.50 a gallon on a gross basis. As far as we look at demand for ethanol, we're feeling, I think, pretty good about maybe something happening with the fuel spec in the U.S. to get to a 95 RON, a higher efficiency engine. Good for the autos, good for ethanol, good for oil. So, we're more optimistic about that than we probably have been in the past, that would increase the ethanol blending. The Ethanol is definitely in the fuel mix to stay in the U.S. And we're seeing -- now we're getting into situation too with pretty good export demand again, that's kind of picking back up post the big impacts of COVID. So, we're pretty optimistic about the future there. But it's really -- what's driving our optimism is the Low Carbon. We're deep into corn fiber ethanol at this point. Producing that at several sites and the outlook for the carbon sequestration. Prashant Rao : Got it. Thanks, Martin. Appreciate that. Thank you very much, guys. I'll leave it there. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Prashant. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Manav Gupta of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Manav Gupta : Hey guys. A little bit follow-up on that question. When we go back and look at 18 and 19 and you're specifically our Gulf Coast scrap, it was about averaging about 1072. You are indicators are indicating it's closer to 13 right now. Brand WCS is almost 9. I know we have still some times to go in this quarter, but the way things are shaping up is it fair to say your strongest Gulf course quarter in probably 2 to 3 years is now approaching? Gary Simmons : Well, again, we don't know how the quarter is going to shape-up. But certainly, if you look at the month-to-date indicator, it is significantly above mid-cycle. We would agree with you on that. Manav Gupta : Okay. And a quick follow-up here is there are number of commercial technologies out there to produce sustainable aviation fuel, but nothing works like HAFFA and nobody works HAFFA better than Valero does. And so, we're seeing out there smaller players come out with lesser commercial technologies, get big off-take agreements with airlines, big companies, and the guy who can do it that best is still sitting on the sidelines. So, I was wondering what gets Valero involved in sustainable aviation fuel? Martin Parrish : Sure, Manav, this is Martin. Well, we're progressing our SAF production through our gated engineering process and we're currently developing, talking with customers, and as you stated, there's plenty of customers that are interested in SAF, so it's not really a demand issue. And also want to state that a DGD 4 is not required for SAF as we have -- can retrofit DGD 1, 2 or 3 or any combination thereof. The thing about SAF is it does require additional investment, a fractionator at a minimum and maybe additional equipment beyond that. So, the price of SAP needs to be such to justify that incremental investment. So, we're not waiting engineering-wise for the final outcome on the SAP blender's tax credit. But we do think a favorable tax credit compared to the -- a dollar gallon that you get on the blender's tax credit. So favorable one to that, it's likely needed to proceed beyond engineering. And as you say, it's not a question of if we are going to produce and sell SAP, it's a question of when. But again, we're looking for positive incremental EBITDA out of this, and not just to do it. So that's what's the holdup is right now. Manav Gupta : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Paul Sankey of Sankey Research. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey : Good morning, everyone. Joe Gorder : Hello. Paul. Paul Sankey : It's a long time since we've worried about natural gas prices. Can you remind me what the sensitivity sort of rule of thumb you guys uses for how battle good it is, and how much that's changed since, it's been 10 years or so since it's really been a problem, has your asset-based changed in terms of sensitivity? Thanks. Jason Fraser : Dollar change per million BTUs, about $0.20, $0.22 a barrel or gross. Paul Sankey : Great. Lane while I have you, the crude slate has changed a lot over that period as well. Nothing from Venezuela, very low Saudi, plenty from Canada, issues with Mexico. Can you just talk about -- and also notably some significant discounts, for example, West Africa to brand, Dubai to brand. Can you talk a bit about how you're managing the crude market? Thanks. Lane Riggs : I'll let my good friend Gary answer that question. Gary Simmons : So far today, if you look, we're seeing the widest margin in some of the heavy feed stocks we run. You mentioned, heavy canadian has good margins, some of the fuel blend stocks that we're running today have good margin. In terms of the other light sweet to medium sour, it comes and goes. If you look at today's market, it would favor light sweet over medium sours. But in general, what we're seeing is, in our Gulf Coast assets, as you move east in the Gulf, you tend to have better economics on the medium sours, and as you move west, it favors running more light sweet. Paul Sankey : Is the -- has the lower amount of crude coming out of the U.S. itself had a major impact? Gary Simmons : No. As long as we are still exporting crude, that really kind of sets the Brent TI and we're a long way from getting to a point where we're not in the export markets. Paul Sankey : Yeah, that make sense. The -- in fact my rule of thumb for my final part, what's your sensitivity to jet fuel if there's a way of framing that? Because obviously if we see that come back, I would have thought it's the highest margin product you guys produce. I just want to know how maybe what the opportunity cost has being at the lost jet fuel or what the issues have been around operations. Thanks. Lane Riggs : This is Lane. I would tell you that I don't know if I would -- Gary, I wouldn't consider. It's all a matter of optimization. If you look at it historically it's has had the ran in it. So, you can compare jet to ULSD and you can see what it -- almost always in the industry [Indiscernible] out to the penny. So, I would say most of the time, unless there's something unusual, the market is essentially in different ULSD between jet. Now with that said, our operations, especially we can actually go -- almost go down to 0 jet, and the way we we're configured, so I wouldn't say there's been a big opportunity cost not making jet. Now, obviously, what that means to the industry is that jet has been going into diesel. And so, to the extent it created [Indiscernible] and potentially hurt the crack, but as you've heard throughout the call, jet -- diesel demand is actually above where it was. So, there's been some offsets to all that. Specifically, I don't think us not being able to make jet's been a big [Indiscernible] to us. Paul Sankey : Yeah, that makes sense and it's just -- you make an interesting point about how much latent diesel demand there is with the shortage of truckers and everything else. The diesel market looks really, really tight, right? Jason Fraser : Yes. Paul Sankey : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Morning. Paul Cheng : I want to also ask a question on the natural gas. Lane, I think you talked about earlier when Sankey ask ed about the cost, the $0.22 per barrel. How about on the gross margin capture, given that the hydrocracker [Indiscernible] for heavy [Indiscernible] put, you use up 0.6 PCF of gas and hydro treatment [Indiscernible], so how should we look at the higher natural gas price to impact volumes on the gross margin? After that I have another question. Jason Fraser : Yeah, it's about $0.10 a barrel in cost of goods. Paul Cheng : Is $0.10 per barrel for every $1? Jason Fraser : Yes. Paul Cheng : Okay. The second question is that, I think this is for Martin. When we look at the DGD, we saw in the third quarter in ethanol, they both come in the gross margin worse than what the benchmark indicator will be. Benchmark indicator is in now number that for renewable diesel, seems like it's pretty spread. But your gross margin, accurate job, placed substantially. And then for ethanol is actually up on the gross margin indicator, but you guys are actually did not. It is actually down. I think for ethanol it's a fiscal issue and I think that a bit of the fiscal issue on the renewable diesel in the third quarter also. So, can you maybe elaborate a bit, help us to understand what happened and also whether those trends continue into the fourth quarter? And also, if you can tell us that -- what is the current DGD 2 curve on one way? Thank you. Gary Simmons : Hi, Paul, I might need some help in keeping those straight. Here we go. I'm going to start with ethanol. Bust it, Paul Cheng. The third quarter, as you stated, the indicator margin was $0.70 a gallon, Lane Riggs : which was up $0.30 a gallon versus the second quarter. But what you have to remember about that indicator margin is, it's based on the Cbot corn price and does not include the corn basis. In most years, that's a fine approximation to our corn costs, but due to the low corn to stocks -- ratio of the use to -- the stocks to use ratio this year basis was extremely high. If you look at some of the U.S.D.A reports, basis was $1, $1.20 bushel. So that takes $0.30 to $0.40 out of the indicator. So, at the end of the day, the indicator was just artificially high and that kind of EBITDA was not achievable. Gary Simmons : So, the good news is now, with the new corn crop, while the Cbot price is still high, the basis has broken. So those indicator margins you're seeing now, which are over a dollar a gallon, are pretty indicative of where the industry would be. So that's -- so it's not an ongoing issue. But this corn price is going to stay high. And we're going to go through this period probably again next year, where basis, as you get to the end of the corn crop, really gets high. But right now, we're kind of -- the basis is broken. On DGD, the indicator was down to like $2.84 in the third quarter, pretty flat, the second quarter, but on DGD, there's quite a few things moving. The first thing I would tell you, we signaled that we would have lower margins in the third quarter. Some of that was we expected this price is -- as prices are going up, the product prices, fat prices, all that's going up. The RIN goes up immediately, but we've got a lag in our cost of goods with the fat, so when you break over and that price quits increasing or starts decreasing, then your RIN falls immediately and you're still consuming a higher-priced feed stock. So, we had some of that in the third quarter. The other thing that's happened in the third quarter is we were out buying for DGD 2 and we're entering the market and I went through that earlier. Anytime you go into the market in a big way and change these flows, we got inertia in the market and it's going to take a while for it to get back down so we expect these [Indiscernible] prices and a price relative to soybean oil, and we're seeing a little good news there now. So, we expect that to correct itself too. And I'm trying to think what else I missed here. Paul Cheng : What's the DGD 2 current run rate? Gary Simmons : Hey, were just in the process of starting it up, Paul, but we're moving along well. Everything looks good, we don't have a run rate yet. Paul Cheng : Okay. So, you haven't actually stopped running yet? Lane Riggs : Yeah. This is Lane. We actually started it up about three days ago. Paul Cheng : I see. Okay. We do. Thank you. Jason Fraser : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Sam Margolin : Hey, good morning, everyone. Joe Gorder : Hey, Sam. Sam Margolin : Follow-up on capital allocation as the cycle gets firmer here. In the past, the buyback and dividend growths worked together, right? It was sort of partially enabled to grow your dividend as much as you did because you took out 30% of your shares. As we think about entering kind of the next phase of the cycle here into a potentially stronger period, do they have to be together or can you do one component of increasing capital returns without the other? Joe Gorder : Jason is going to love me to take this one. You know Sam I mean; we don't necessarily link them together, right? We do use the 40% to 50% target. Is based on how we make our decisions. And as Jason said earlier, we've got the dividend yield kind of towards the high end of this year range right now. Maybe at the high end of the peer range. So, we'll continue to look at it going forward. And he laid out the priorities really for our use of cash as we go forward and he wants to de -lever a little bit. I guess we're what like somewhere around 37% total debt-to-cap. We'd like to, you know, push it back down closer to that 30% number we had and do that in a multitude of ways. But anyway, that's one of our top priorities. And then we haven't given up on buybacks by any stretch of the imagination. We see them as playing a part in this capital allocation framework going forward. It's funny because you guys love us when we do it and then sometimes, we do it and the price is high and the stock comes up and you say, why did you do buybacks, right? Anyway, it's a fine balancing act for us and I think if you just revert back to the capital allocation framework and the way we've executed it in the past, I think right now, that's our plan for execution going forward. Sam Margolin : Okay. Thanks. Very helpful. And then just -- just a follow-up for Martin on the dynamics in the renewable diesel space. This may have been a coincidence, but at the time that DGD and a competitor plant in the same area were down, the whole complex of bean oil and waste oils came down too. And some people interpreted that as a signal of just how tight the market is. A couple of plants can bring down that complex by $0.20 a pound. Was your -- is your feeling the same thing or was that just a coincidence? And there's actually some spare capacity in feedstock that's underappreciated. Thanks. Martin Parrish : Hey Sam, this is Martin, it's a coincidence definitely on the bean oil side, I mean, when you look at that -- if you look at bean oil prices, soybean oil, just look at any veg oil price. And veg oil price, whether it's palm oil, bean oil, or canola oil, that's the big three globally, they have doubled since the fall of 2019 and all that was led by a shortage of palm oil. The palm oil stocks got lower in Malaysia. So, to put it in perspective, if you look in Malaysia and Indonesia, palm oil, that production is 6 times as large as soybean oil in the U.S. So, palm oil drives veg oil pricing. So anytime you see soybean oil, [Indiscernible] soybean oil move, it's a lot more about palm oil likely than anything else. So now that's said, the waste pig stuff price relative to soybean oil, as I said earlier, I think DGD had had an impact on that. It gets complicated because you're getting into all kinds of tallow and slaughter rates, and the weight of animals and all this information. But we do expect that to come back out. Certainly, you've got a situation now where the waste feed stuff prices are on an energy content or way above the value of corn on an energy content. So, the people feeding waste oils are trying to figure out wastes not to feed waste oils. So, we're still optimistic about waste feed stuff in the future and really glad we have always pre -treatment capacity to handle it. Sam Margolin : Thanks so much. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe just a natural follow-up on your last comment there. But over the last 12 months, we've seen a lot of headlines about potential capacity additions in renewable diesel. But I think we've also seen a shift amongst a lot of those additions towards what I would characterize as a capital light entry to renewable diesel targeting vegetable oils and avoiding the cost of pre -treatment facility. So how do you see these trends impacting already markets over the next few years given your increasingly differentiated position on feedstock flexibility and sourcing? Martin Parrish : Sure. Yeah, well I would say that this higher veg oil prices given what's going on in palm oil is kind of a structural shortage there now. The plantations, the trees are getting older, the yields getting less, so there's a little bit of a veg oil issue that's been coming for years, so we don't see the veg oil prices moderating. Which you have to remember that for Diamond Green Diesel for our renewable diesel business, a high veg oil prices met with a higher D4 RIN. And the absolute veg oil pricing doesn't dictate margin for us, and also the spread between RVD soybean oil, and crude degummed soybean oil does not impact DGD. So being in this waste feed stock position with robust pre -treatment just puts us in a lot better position than the guys that are acCompanying in and running veg oils and not -- so that position I think is going to be little tough. But we feel pretty good about our position. Ryan Todd : Good. Thanks. And then maybe -- a follow-up on er shift to refining. I assume we know your answer to use specifically, but there are quite a few -- a lot of refineries is currently being marketed out there. What would it take for you to seriously consider adding another asset to your portfolio and if not, for you specifically? How do you see this shaking out with a lot of these assets? Do you see more closures or I guess how do you see this asset long position right now playing out over the next 12 to 18 months? Joe Gorder : All right. Well, I'll answer it this way and then Rich can say whatever he wants. We're very comfortable with the portfolio that we have today. As you know, we've got a strong track record of having grown through acquisition in the past, and there was a time in place for that strategy to be executed, and we executed it really well. And then we spent the last 10 years plus, just getting the assets up to a standard that we were comfortable operating them in. And we realize that any acquisition like that that we would we would end up going through the same process. And so, it would have to be an incredibly compelling case for us to give that any consideration. And so, although we continue to look at what's in the market just to be sure we don't miss opportunities, I wouldn't anticipate that you should expect us to be doing anything on that front. I'd rather invest in the assets that we know, continue to optimize the assets that we have, and build the renewables business right now than investing in additional refining capacity. Ryan Todd : Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Gabelman : Thanks. I guess the first one just an easy modeling. On this lower tax rate, is that a good rate to use moving forward? I think you mentioned the low rate was driven by the DGD non-op impact. So just wondering if that's a good rate and if anything, else drove the lower effective tax rate for the quarter. And secondly, I just wanted to go back to the LCFS price volatility in California. It seems there's a lot of renewable fuel capacity coming online next year. And I'm wondering in the market we're in right now at what price does the LCFS price have to go to in order to maybe consider selling some of your renewable diesel into Europe rather than in California. I'm asking because you guys have a good position in terms of your U.S. Gulf Coast optionality\u2019s, I'm wondering if you could give any insight to that. Thanks. Mark Schmeltekopf : All right. Yeah, this is Mark Schmeltekopf, I'll take the question on the tax rate and then hand it over to Martin for your second question. The tax rate for the quarter does look -- it was 11%, it's a little challenging to tell you kind of what to expect in the future, but in the near future, I would say it would be somewhat under 21%. Just as a reminder, and as we said in the earnings release, you have to remember the impact that the DGD earnings have on the effective tax rate. So, our consolidated pretax income includes 100% of DGD income. And while tax expense only reflects taxes on a portion of that income, there's no tax expense on our share of the blender's tax credits included in DGDs income nor is there any tax on our partners half of DGDs income. So that impact is pretty having an outweighed impact on our overall effective rate. And I just also want to remind you that our partner's share of DGD s income is excluded from our net income by backing it out in non-controlling interest. So, if you look at it just from a purely EPS or cash standpoint, the only benefit LIRA is getting is not being taxed on our share of the blender's tax credit, which is quite a bit lower than I think some of the analysts are thinking it does. So, what it tells you is that our results are not driven as much by the perceived tax benefit as they were by underlying recovery and margins. And so, I'll hand it over to Martin. Martin Parrish : Sure. Thanks, Mark. Yeah, on the -- I would say on the LCFS, if you look about look at it, it's really to get to the root of your question is, again, this has been a lot more about deficit out there driving the price down and to me, credits in the first quarter of '21 renewable diesel blending was 23% in California. The highest previous quarter was 18%, but still the credits aren't just exploding in California is just a lack of deficits. And I think as we get out of the COVID and the Delta variant and back to work and we've got a big debt lag right now in California, right? We don't know what the second quarter that is will know that the end of October, And credit prices are up, they've hit a low of a dollar [Indiscernible] $58 a ton, now they are 175. But to get to your question, we routinely go to Europe and Canada with our fuel already. We're always looking at the different markets and working for the highest impact and given our long-term contracts we'll sometimes be constrained but we're always in those markets. Jason Gabelman : All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from William -- I'm sorry, Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in here. I was wondering if you anticipate being a shipper on Capline to your Louisiana refineries, and if so, would that be WCS or perhaps some other crude? Looking at that Capline tariff filing from earlier this week, expected volumes are only a 102,000 barrels per day, which just seems kind of low, so just trying to suss out if that's due to a lack of interest from Louisiana refineries or that's due to the lack of supply with the connector pipeline not going through. Thanks. Gary Simmons : Yeah. So, this is Gary, with most of the pipelines and Capline, really not too much different for us. Our focus has been on getting good connectivity to those pipelines, but not necessarily taking a shipper commitment. We let the producer ship, and then we buy at the other end. And I think that's what we would plan to do with Capline as well. Matthew Blair : And do you think those volumes will be WCS coming down, or something else? Gary Simmons : Well, that's a good question. I think it looks like initially it will be mainly like sweet [Indiscernible] certainly with the Line 3 replacement, we could see heavy Canadian making its way into cap line at some point in time. And that would be good for us, a more efficient way to get heavy Canadian to our St. Charles Refinery. Matthew Blair : Indeed. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Matthew. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Susana. Appreciate everyone dialing in today. If you have any questions, you want to follow up on, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thanks, everyone, and please stay safe and healthy. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation and interest in Valero. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance. Thank you. Please go ahead. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We saw continued improvement in our business during the fourth quarter with refining margins supported by strong product demand. In our system, we ended the year with gasoline demand at pre-pandemic levels and demand for diesel actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. We also saw a significant jet fuel recovery as domestic and international travel opened up, increasing from approximately 60% of pre-pandemic levels at the beginning of the year to approximately 80% at the end of the year. Product inventories were low as a result of the refining capacity rationalization that's taken place in the last 2 years and weather-related impacts from Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida. On the crude oil side, OPEC+ increased production throughout the year with improving demand supplying the market primarily with sour crude oils, resulting in wider sour crude oil discounts to Brent crude oil. As a result of all these dynamics, we saw a steady recovery in margins throughout the year, particularly for our complex refining system. In regards to our ethanol segment, ethanol prices were near record highs in the quarter, supported by strong demand and low inventories. Strong margins, coupled with solid operational performance across all of our segments, generated record quarterly operating income for our ethanol segment and record overall fourth quarter earnings for Valero. I am proud to say that 2021 was our best year ever for employee and process safety. In fact, we've set records for process safety for 3 consecutive years. These milestones are a testament to our long-standing commitment to safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operations. And despite the pandemic and weather-related challenges in 2021, our growth projects remained on track. We started up the Pembroke cogeneration unit in the third quarter of '21, which provides an efficient and reliable source of electricity and steam, and enhances the refinery's competitiveness. In addition, the Diamond Green Diesel expansion project, DGD 2, commenced operations in the fourth quarter on budget and ahead of schedule. The expansion has since demonstrated production capacity of 410 million gallons per year renewable diesel as a result of process optimization, above the initial nameplate design capacity of 400 million gallons per year. This expansion brings DGD's total annual renewable diesel capacity to 700 million gallons. Looking ahead, the DGD 3 project at our Port Arthur refinery is progressing ahead of schedule and is now expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2023. With the completion of this, 470 million-gallon per year plant, DGD's total annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. BlackRock and Navigator\u2019s large-scale carbon sequestration project is also progressing on schedule and is still expected to begin start-up activities in late 2024. Valero is expected to be the anchor shipper with 8 ethanol plants connected to the system, which should provide a higher ethanol product margin. The Port Arthur Coker project, which is expected to increase the refinery's utilization rate and improved turnaround efficiency, is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. On the financial side, the guiding framework underpinning our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, which prioritizes a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. In 2021, we took measures to reduce Valero's long-term debt by approximately $1.3 billion. We ended the year well capitalized with $4.1 billion of cash and $5.2 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. And our net debt to capitalization was 33%. We continue to honor our commitment to stockholders, defending the dividend across margin cycles and delivering a payout ratio of 50% in 2021. And as recently announced, the Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share for the first quarter of 2022. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic on refining margins, with low global light product inventories, strong product demand, global supply tightness due to significant refining capacity rationalization and wider sour crude oil differentials. We also remain optimistic on our low-carbon businesses, which we continue to expand with the growing global demand for lower carbon intensity products. We've been leaders in the growth of these businesses and maintain a competitive advantage with our operational and technical expertise. In closing, our team's simple strategy of pursuing excellence in operations, deploying capital with an uncompromising focus on returns and honoring our commitment to stockholders, has driven our success and positions us well. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the fourth quarter of 2021, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1 billion or $2.46 per share compared to a net loss of $359 million or $0.88 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. Fourth quarter 2021 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was also $1 billion or $2.47 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $429 million or $1.06 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. For 2021, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $930 million or $2.27 per share compared to a net loss of $1.4 billion or $3.50 per share in 2020. 2021 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.2 billion or $2.81 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $1.3 billion or $3.12 per share in 2020.  For reconciliations to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany the earnings release. The refining segment reported $1.3 billion of operating income for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to a $377 million operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2020. Fourth quarter 2021 adjusted operating income for the refining segment was $1.1 billion compared to an adjusted operating loss of $476 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. Refining throughput volumes in the fourth quarter of 2021 averaged 3 million barrels per day, which was 483,000 barrels per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. Throughput capacity utilization was 96% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 81% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.86 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2021 were $0.46 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. The renewable diesel segment operating income was $150 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $127 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $152 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 1.6 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2021, which was 974,000 gallons per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. The higher operating income and sales volumes were primarily attributed to the start-up of Diamond Green Diesel expansion project, DGD 2, in the fourth quarter. The ethanol segment reported record operating income of $474 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $15 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $475 million compared to $17 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.4 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2021, which was 278,000 gallons per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. And as Joe mentioned earlier, the higher operating income was primarily attributed to higher ethanol prices, which were supported by strong demand and low inventories. For the fourth quarter of 2021, G&A expenses were $286 million and net interest expense was $152 million. G&A expenses of $865 million in 2021 were largely in line with our guidance. Depreciation and amortization expense was $598 million and income tax expense was $169 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. The annual effective tax rate was 17% for 2021, which reflects the benefit from the portion of DGD's net income that is not taxable to us. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $5.9 billion for the full year. Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of $595 million in the fourth quarter and $2.2 billion in 2021, and the other joint venture members, 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.3 billion for the full year. With regard to investing activities, we made $752 million of total capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2021, of which $353 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and $399 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture members, 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $545 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $1.8 billion for the year.  Moving to financing activities. We returned $401 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2021 through our dividend and $1.6 billion through dividends in the year, resulting in a 2021 payout ratio of 50% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities for the year. And our Board of Directors recently approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share, demonstrating our sound financial position and commitment to return cash to our investors. With respect to our balance sheet at year-end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $13.9 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $4.1 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 33%. In the fourth quarter, we completed a series of debt reduction and refinancing transactions that together reduced Valero's long-term debt by $693 million. These debt reduction and refinancing transactions, combined with the redemption of $575 million floating rate senior notes due 2023 in the third quarter, collectively reduced Valero's long-term debt by $1.3 billion. At the end of the year, we had $5.2 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2022 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. Approximately 50% of our growth capital in 2022 is allocated to expanding our low-carbon businesses. For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.66 million to 1.71 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 395,000 to 415,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 185,000 to 205,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.80 per barrel. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 700 million gallons in 2022. Operating expenses in 2022 should be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.2 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.44 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $150 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $600 million. For 2022, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $870 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again, respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to 2 questions. If you have more than 2 questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Please respect this request to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Theresa Chen : Joe, I'd like to revisit your comments earlier about the refining margin outlook through 2022. I mean clearly, we seem to have a pretty positive setup with lean global inventories and significant amount of refining rationalization that's happened since and even slightly before the pandemic began while demand continues to recover and remain resilient. So looking through the rest of this year, can you just give us a sense of puts and takes on the variables that could detract from this thesis, either risk to the downside or upside from here? Joe Gorder : Sure, Theresa. Thanks a lot. Why don't we let Gary take a look at -- take a crack at this? Gary Simmons : Sure, Theresa. If you look -- I mean, I'll just kind of go through some of the things we're seeing in our system. We saw good recovery last year, both gasoline and diesel and even good recovery in jet fuel demand. And we expect that rebound to continue through 2022. We started the year, gasoline demand is off a little bit from what we would expect. Some of that is just seasonality. But even if you go back to 2019, we were in 2019 at this time of the year, we're off about 7% with the spike in COVID cases and also some weather impacting gasoline demand as well. But I would tell you already, our 7-day average is only off about 3% of where it was in 2019. So it looks like this latest surge in COVID cases we\u2019re already coming out of it. And so with where gasoline inventories are, very bullish gasoline moving forward. As you already pointed out, we expect to see gasoline demand back to 2019 levels, which was close to peak gasoline demand, and we'll be trying to feed that demand with significantly less refining capacity. So we expect the gasoline markets to be very tight. When you move to diesel, of course, diesel inventories are not only low in the United States, but they're low globally. Diesel demand actually in our system has been about 7% of where it was in 2019. So some of those factors, in particular, weather that are negatively impacting gasoline are actually -- are having a positive impact on diesel demand. So we see very strong diesel demand. And we actually don't see a clear path in the near future to be able to restock those investors in turnaround activity that's occurring in the industry, along with the rationalization that's occurred. So for us, both gasoline and diesel look very constructive moving throughout the year. Jet demand will be the unknown. Our expectation is that as we get through this wave of COVID, much like we saw last year, domestic air travel will pick back up fairly rapidly but it will be a longer period of time before international travel picks back up. So although we expect to be closed back to 2019 levels by the end of the year, probably not fully recovered. I think to me, when you talk about the wild card, really the wildcard for this year is what happens in the crude market. Obviously, a lot of tightness in the crude markets today, certainly having an impact on differentials and so for us, it's kind of when do we see OPEC begin to ramp up production. As global oil demand picks up, we would expect OPEC to increase production. A lot of that will be medium and heavy sour barrels, which would be constructive to wider differentials moving throughout the year as well. Theresa Chen : That's great color. So I got to ask the capital allocation question. You have been so consistent on your messaging as well as execution around this. And with the progress that you've made on reducing debt, generating free cash flow for the past couple of quarters and generally positive momentum on the near-term refining outlook. Are we at an inflection point where we may soon see a step-up in cash return to shareholders? Joe Gorder : Jason? Jason Fraser : Yes, this is Jason. I'll take that. And you're right, we've made good progress on our goals. We have said when we started coming out of this situation, we rebuild our cash and target keeping more on hand around $3 billion. We've done that. We had $4.1 billion at the end of the year. We also said we're really going to start working on delevering. And in the third and fourth quarters of last year, we did delevering transactions paid off about $1.3 billion net, brought our net debt to cap down to 33% at the end of the year, and our goal is to ultimately get back to our 20% to 30% long-term target we've had. And the pace is going to depend on margins and cash generation.  But getting on to buybacks and the return of cash to shareholders. As you said, things are looking better now. For 2021, the payout was 50% with just the dividend and some minimal buybacks related to the employee plans. But with the margin increase in the fourth quarter and they're continuing to be strong during the first quarter so far, if this pattern of recovery does continue, we do anticipate we'll be doing buybacks this year to meet our target. And we feel we can both continue to our pattern, our goal of having aggressive debt paydown this year and also meet our shareholder return commitment via projects -- via buybacks, I'm sorry. We definitely don't think they're mutually exclusive and it's all driven by our framework and targets we've had in place for several years. Operator : Our next question is coming from Manav Gupta of Credit Suisse. Manav Gupta : I just -- I had first question was on DGD. What we are seeing out there is number of projects getting delayed, long lead equipment not getting through. Everybody is kind of lagging. You are an exception, your project keeps moving forward. And I know you always tell me, you have the best people. But besides best people, what else are you doing right, which is allowing you to move the time line forward versus everybody else going backwards? Joe Gorder : Wow! I don't -- should we even say anything? Lane Riggs : I'm still going to say we have the best people. Hey, Manav, this is Lane. We also completed Diamond Green 2, right? So we have a really good understanding of what the project execution looks like. We have the same business partners that are largely executing Diamond Green 2. And we've been able to really improve the schedule, and it's really just -- we've been -- we\u2019ve built 2 of these, we're in our third, and it's just a really good team all the way around, not just our people, we have good business partners as well. And we also are permitting, we permit these even better. So just.... Joe Gorder : Yes. And there's -- Lane, there's been a lot of lessons learned as we went through 1. And so I mean\u2026 Lane Riggs : That\u2019s what I mean. We've built 1, we\u2019ve built -- we just finished 2 and we've learned all through all those things. We are definitely -- we have the advantage of being an early mover in this space. Manav Gupta : Perfect, guys. My second follow-up very quickly here is it looks like your partner is moving ahead with kind of an acquisition, which would give you guys more used cooking oil, more animal fats. At this stage, I think there was a point to get in more animal fats from international to feed DGD 3. How is the feedstock situation looking for DGD 3? Are you very close to what you would need when DGD 3 is up and running in terms of feedstock now? Martin Parrish : Yes, Manav, this is Martin. Obviously, our plan is to continue to feed DGD 1, 2 and 3 with waste feedstock. We feel good about that. The market -- feedstock market has tightened up relative to soybean oil. And we knew that was coming with the start-up of DGD 2. We changed trade flows. We've moved everything around, and that's had an impact on the market. And frankly, when we contemplated DGD 2 and 3, we expect that feedstock to appreciate relative to soybean oil and we expected carbon pricing to appreciate. So we're kind of where we expected to be here. And yes, the feedstock situation, it's a moving target, but it's all tied to global GDP growth. And just to sum it up, yes, we expect to be able to feed it. Operator : Our next question is coming from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Philip Gresh : The Gulf Coast refining margins in the fourth quarter were the best since 2015, if I have that right. And they're even better than 4Q '19 when we were talking about IMO 2020 and feedstock advantages and things like that. So I was just curious if there's anything more to elaborate on about the strength of the Gulf Coast margins that we saw in the quarter and how you think about the sustainability of that? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think a lot of -- typically in the Gulf Coast, when we see stronger capture rates, it's tied to feedstock optimization. And so certainly, we've been doing a lot around some of those fuel oil blend stocks and running more of those in our system, which has helped supported higher capture rates. Philip Gresh : Got it. Okay. And then second question, just a follow-up on some of the commentary there on renewable diesel. The gross margins there, down sequentially. It sounds like you expected some of that, but the capture rate, the indicator there was, I think, a bit lower than maybe some had expected. Were there any transitory factors there, in your opinion, in the quarter as you started up Phase 2 and whether it's with feedstock or other factors? Or is this how you think about kind of a run rate moving forward? Martin Parrish : Sure, Phil. This is Martin. So margin capture in 2021 was all about the feedstock price. In first half of '21, feedstock prices were low relative to soybean oil, which resulted in some really high margin capture. In the fourth quarter, the prices were high relative to soybean oil and that gave us a lower margin capture at 75%. With the start-up of DGD 2, we're going to have tighter prices for a while. We expect feedstock to be around soybean oil going forward for the immediate future. And then we'll see how that plays out in the next few months after that. But we expect it to be right around soybean oil, which would incur closer to this 100% type margin capture. And that's what we experienced throughout 2019. If you go back and look at those numbers, we averaged right around 100% margin capture. So that's kind of how we expect things to shake out in the next few months. Operator : Our next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Roger Read : I want to come back, if possible, to the crude tightness comments, just what you're seeing in terms of differentials, what you'd expect? And then are we highly dependent here on OPEC putting more oil in the market? Or is there some other factor at work? And one of the reasons I ask is some of the closures that we saw on the refining side tended to be a light suite unit. So if physical demand is down on that side, is that also accounting for some of the tightness of the differentials? Gary Simmons : Yes, Roger, it's Gary. I think there's a number of factors that contributed to the tightness, not simply OPEC. We saw the winter weather have an impact on heavy Canadian production from Western Canada. We had disruptions from supply in Ecuador. There's been -- the pipeline issue between -- the pipeline between Iraq and Turkey that took barrels off the market. So a number of factors. We think going forward, again, not only get OPEC production ramping up. We expect to not only see the Western Canadian production come back, we actually think it will grow with some of the logistics projects coming back on. And so most of that production that was off the market is coming back. In addition to that production coming on the market, the OPEC production growing will take some of the pressure off the crude markets and certainly pressure off the crude differentials. Roger Read : And then my unrelated follow-up question is coming to you, Jason. Like the insight on the possibility of getting back to more normal cash returns model in '22. I was curious, though, given the significant improvement in working capital in '21, are we at risk of seeing some of that reverse in '22? Or when you think about the outlook, do you assume a neutral working capital event and maybe we should assume something going the other way? Jason Fraser : Yes. Well, our movements in working capital generally follow flat price. So when we're forecasting, we just assume neutral cash on working capital as our basis. Roger Read : So just a quick reminder. If prices go up, positive prices go down, it's going to eat working capital? Jason Fraser : Right. That's right. Operator : Our next question is coming from Prashant Rao of Citigroup. Prashant Rao : I wanted to circle back on the capital allocation piece a little bit. You've done a great job reducing debt. It looks like you'll be able to take another chunk out this year, got high balance sheet cash. And it sounds like you're very positive on buybacks. I just sort of wanted to ask about the dividend. I know if it might be a bit premature at this point, but given that we're looking at what could be an above mid-cycle here in earnings. You've gotten debt controlled and the yield is starting to come in. Currently, just I annualized a little bit under 5% and tighter than that if the share price continues to work, is taking a hard look at the dividend, something that potentially increase something that you might think of this year? Or is it too soon to start talking about that? Jason Fraser : Yes. This is Jason. It's probably a little soon given what we just came through. But we always look at it. Our commitment is to have a sustainable dividend with a yield at the high end of our peer group, and that's where it is now, where the peers are and the market is, we think it's in a good place. Prashant Rao : Okay. Perfect. And then just... Joe Gorder : Prashant, at this time last year, there was a big question on sustainability of the dividend, right? A lot can change in a short period. Now you never questioned it. You always had faith, stuff like that. But anyways, it\u2019s interesting how things come around. Prashant Rao : It's true. It's like a different world altogether, right, Joe? Joe Gorder : Yes. There it is. Prashant Rao : Just another quick question. Ethanol, obviously, historically, high performance here. This is the best quarter we've seen since you've been reporting quarterly results at ethanol. Just wondering a little bit about strength carryover. I think when we discussed this a couple of months back, there were some cautious -- cautious read across as to what happens in 2022 given how volatile the ethanol market is and all the puts and takes. I was just wondering if big picture how to think about how -- where we -- level set where we are entering 2022 think about what the cadence might be there? Some of that strength carrying over, but also there's a lot going on in terms of policy, gasoline demand, a whole bunch of factors there. So just wonder if we could get some color and maybe a little bit of clarity as to how we should be thinking about that as we look into '22? Martin Parrish : Prashant, this is Martin. Well, obviously, fourth quarter was a great quarter for ethanol. When you look at it, what really set that up is, we -- in the third quarter, the margin started off really weak. And we were also at the end of crop year corn. So that this wasn't corn available in the industry is pretty -- very low stocks. So there was a lot of run cuts, a lot of early maintenance taken and the plants really didn't rebound. And I'm talking across the industry, I'm not talking just Valero, and get rates back up until early October. And then rates exceeded. I mean in early October rates exceeded the 5-year averages. But what was interesting even with higher rates, inventory just never built. So when you have a low inventory situation that leads to high margins, and that's what we saw. So now the last few weeks of the year and the first few weeks of 2022, we've had significant inventory build. So the margins have come off dramatically. But that being said, we're still probably where we typically are in the first quarter for ethanol margins. And I think what we always are looking at, at ethanol now, though, is the longer term and that's the carbon capture. That's going to provide a great opportunity for us, both from the 45Q and the LCFS. And also we're producing -- start to produce more and more gallons of cellulosic ethanol from corn fiber. So we're optimistic about both of those. We're also just confident that ethanol is going to remain a part of the domestic fuel mix. We expect higher octane blends in the future, namely 95 RON, which means more ethanol blending. And globally, the renewable fuel mandates are going to drive export growth. So we feel really good about ethanol going forward, maybe not this quarter, next quarter. But longer term, we feel really good about ethanol. Operator : Our next question is coming from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Douglas Leggate : Joe, I'm sorry, I'm going to hit the capital allocation question 1 more time, maybe a slightly different angle. So the balance between dividends and buybacks is really what I'm kind of focused on here because, I mean, you could easily buy back 5-plus percent of your stock. That's a pretty healthy dividend growth for an ordinary business and I remind your business. So I'm just kind of curious how you think about the balance going forward as you reconsider the right level of debt perhaps and the right balance between that 40% to 50% cash allocation to cash returns between the dividend and the buyback. I know it's a broad question, but I'm just kind of curious how -- I guess what's behind us, Joe, is in years gone by, there's been criticism of buybacks at a high price level. I'm wondering if the buyback is more a tool to manage the dividend burden going forward? Joe Gorder : Yes. No, Doug, it certainly would be and when you think about where the yield has been particularly last year, I mean, we've been flushed with cash last year, we had bought back a ton of shares, but we weren't. And you're right, it is a double-edged sword, right? We end up with good cash flows and typically a high stock price all at the same time. So that's why it's hard to create a formulaic approach to how we look at doing this. And so I think Jason has laid it out, coming out of COVID, we had a very specific set of priorities that we wanted to put in place. And I think he covered those. What I'll do is, look, we got a good strong CFO. We'll see what he thinks here. You've got anything you'd like to share? Jason Fraser : Yes, everything you said was accurate. And you have to -- we have to -- we have a balanced dividend because as we've proven through the last downturn, we're going to defend it in the downturn. So you have to be wary of making it too high. And the buybacks give you the flywheel. Joe Gorder : Yes. So Doug, I wouldn't say -- I mean, we always look at the dividend, and we'd like to increase it. I think there's a time when it will be right to do that. And it's a burden that we've been able to carry. Certainly, it's easy in a good margin environment like we have today. But in the down margin environment, as Jason said, we\u2019ve defended it. And it was a bit of a load. But we're committed to it, and we just don't want to get overextended. Jason Fraser : And it's well positioned versus the peers. Our first step is to look versus our peers, we committed to be up near the top of the end and as long as we're the highest, that box is checked. Douglas Leggate : I want to be respectful to everyone else, and I'm going to take my second question on the same topic, if you don't mind, because I'm looking at, for example, what some of the Canadians have done, think about actual companies that have long-life sustainable assets. Obviously, your business is very similar to that in some respects in terms of the annuity nature. So I wonder then, with some folks did question your dividend last year, I know that\u2019s on my hat, but why then wouldn't you use your balance sheet, take your balance sheet to a much stronger level, so that kind of concern can be taken out of the investment case. So in other words, why is 20% to 30% the right level? Why not go lower given the drop that we all saw in the past year? And I'll leave it there. Joe Gorder : Doug, that's a fair question. And I can tell you, that's 1 of the things that Jason and Homer are looking at consistently. The capital markets were very accessible last year, even in the downturn. And rates were so attractive that we were able to really do a good job of financing the business through this. But again, you never really know. Jason? Jason Fraser : Yes. That's right. One thing we do to address this is hold a higher cash balance. But we also want to have an efficient capital structure and debt is pretty cheap right now. The 1 to 0 debt would give you the maximum flexibility and kind of resilience, but then you have a cost of a higher cost. Joe Gorder : But Doug, are you proposing that we would like lever up to buy back shares or something along those lines? Douglas Leggate : Well, it's really -- yes, it's really more that so you're opportunistically positioned to lean on the balance sheet when you need to without the market speculating about the dividend. It's really more because I think your business can support on annuity dividend discount model type of approach, but the balance sheet needs to be rightsized to achieve that. And again, it was just really try and take that volatility out of the go-forward investment case. But I've taken my close of time, Joe, so I appreciate the answers and\u2026. Joe Gorder : Okay. We'll see you soon. Operator : Our next question is coming from Paul Sankey of Sankey Research. Paul Sankey : Can I ask you guys about Europe? Just from your perspective, as a major refiner there. What's going on as regards demand, the impact of natural gas prices, crude slates, the whole bit? Gary Simmons : Yes. So this is Gary. I guess what we're seeing in terms of demand is they're kind of ahead of where we are in recovery from the latest spike in COVID cases. If you look at our 7 day in the UK, we're up about 10% of where we were month to date. So starting to see good recovery in mobility and gasoline demand in the system. Again, very similar situation on diesel. ARA stocks are very low. So diesel looks very constructive as well.  On the natural gas side, you see some switching of crude diets as a result of the high natural gas prices still $30 an MMBtu in Northwest Europe. So you see some people kicking out medium and heavy sour grades of crude running more light sweet. I think where we've seen it the most is optimization around hydro processing capacity. So people idling and cutting hydrocracking capacity as a result of very high natural gas prices, which again puts less diesel in the market and is 1 of the reasons why we're experiencing all the tightness around diesel that we are. Paul Sankey : Excellent answer. Can I just follow up with California. We've seen margins come off quite a bit there. But more importantly, could you talk a bit about how renewable diesel will play through in that market where you're exposed to both sides. I just wonder what your perspective is because we could see a situation, obviously, where the market gets quite challenged, I think, by renewables. Martin Parrish : Yes, Paul, this is Martin. Renewable diesel has held up really well from a demand side in California. It's kind of amazing to me going through COVID what we've seen out there. Obviously, deficits have decreased, and they've decreased because of less carbo or gasoline use and less diesel use, but renewable diesel and for the first half of the year, and that's the latest stats we have is around 23% of the diesel pool in California. So it's -- we're blending in an R23 state-wide, which is pretty amazing. And a lot of imports coming into California to renewable diesel. So it's kind of held up remarkably well. And you can say, well, maybe that's why the credit price is down. But I think really, the credit price has got a lot more to do with just less deficits than it has to do with additional credits from renewable diesel. So we -- that's a great market for us. What really got hurt demand-wise was more in Europe on renewable diesel and probably more in Canada, too, with just the kind of waiting for the CFS. So we expect those 2 to rebound and with that more demand globally. Paul Sankey : Understood. Could you just throw the answer forward a little bit? As we look over the next couple of years in terms of how the supply demand, the balance might play out? And I'll leave it there. Sorry, not to make you laugh today, Joe, but... Joe Gorder : Paul, I'll tell you what. We'll have a chance for that here pretty soon, won't we? Martin Parrish : I think if you play it forward, there's really nothing that stops renewable diesel from -- you can blend it really any rate with renewable diesel, right? There's 85% renewable diesel sold in California today. I think CARB's projections are to get somewhere around R40 by 2030. I think a lot of people think that it could be higher than that. So that's California, but you've also got other states considering LCFS. You've got the CFS in Canada that we're looking forward to by the end of this year. And the Canadian decelerate the size of California's market. So that's going to be a big market for us, and we expect that people will over generate credits early when they can, right? That's what happened in California. There was early credit generation, building up a credit bank, and we expect to see the same thing in Canada, which is good for renewable diesel demand. Operator : Our next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Two questions, please. First is for Martin. I think within the renewable diesel, another product seems to be getting some excitement by some of your peers, SAF. Just want to see whether the company have any interest in where the economy and what leads to change in order for the economy to be compatible with renewable diesel from your standpoint for you to be interested. And if you -- at that point, what kind of investment you will need to make in order to make the switch? So that's the first question. The second question is probably for Lane. North Atlantic, the fourth quarter margin capture was really good, it\u2019s great. Just want to see if there's any one-off events or also that within the 2 facility in Europe and also that -- in capacity, I mean, which is a stronger unit in terms of the margin capture in the fourth quarter? Martin Parrish : Okay. It's Martin. I'll get started there, Paul. I think we were all looking at the Build Back Better Bill and what was in that on a tax credit basis for SAF and what we saw that incentive level proposed in that bill was not sufficient to attract additional investment to make SAF versus the base case of producing renewable diesel with an existing unit. However, we're still progressing SAF production through our gated engineering process; and concurrently, we're developing customers. There are plenty of customers interested in SAF but a favorable tax credit, something else is going to be required or tax credit or something else to really get over the hump to where SAF is economic to produce relative to producing renewable diesel.  That being said, we're still confident that SAF production is a question of when and not if. We think the margins will eventually work. The SAF is the only way to reduce the carbon intensity of air travel. Paul Cheng : How big is the -- sorry, Lane. Just wanted to follow up on what Martin said. How big is the gap in terms of the incentive for you to fund SAF to be attractive enough compared to the renewable diesel? And also technically that what kind of investment you need to make and how big is the investment for you that to make DGD that to be able to produce that, call it, 20% or 30% in SAF? Martin Parrish : Yes. On the gap, I mean, we're somewhere probably around the $0.70 a gallon gap still, Paul, to make it economic. On the investment, we're still going through our gated process. So we don't have a number on that yet. We have preliminary numbers, but we don't have a number that we're ready to share yet. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. Lane? Lane Riggs : All right. So yes, what's interesting about the 2 refineries we have in the Atlantic Basin is Quebec is seasonally stronger in the fourth and the first quarter, it's largely a distillate, very specialized distillate producing refinery configured, whereas Pembroke is really more of a gasoline producing configured refinery. So that's kind of how they work out. So really, in terms of the fourth quarter performance, it's really Quebec well on their margin capture. And obviously, you have the issues with around high natural gas prices over in the UK Obviously, that helped sort of hurt their margin capture in Pembroke. Paul Cheng : And Lane is there any one-off item that you're benefiting in the quarter? Or that -- it's just that you guys have done a phenomenal job in the operation and be able to fully capture the benefit of that in the market? Lane Riggs : I like the second answer, but it's a -- yes. Quebec ran -- they both ran really well in the quarter. So... Operator : Our next question is coming from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Wanted to just circle back to the industry capacity questions. A few other analysts on the call have alluded to a lot of closures over the past 12 months, but there are some third parties and some management in the industry that are suggesting that the number of closures is even higher than any of us are aware of or any kind of report that we would see might confirm. And so I wonder what your thoughts on that are? And then secondly, there's a 2-part question, but only one. Theoretically where cracks are today, you would think that capacity rationalization would stop here or slow down. But there's other factors that may be driving some closures. So if you think that this trend could continue based on noneconomic factors, would love your input on that, too? Lane Riggs : Sam, it's Lane. So I think we are trying to study the data right now because what we see the similar issue in terms of what where utilization is and versus closures. And again, it's just sort of what we're sort of preliminary deciding or looking at as we think that there's probably some slowdowns that are occurring maybe because of maintenance deferrals or turnaround deferrals in the industry. We don't -- that's not something we know, but it's a theory as to what you're seeing. And certainly, where margins are now the call on capacity is pretty much max. So other than the turnarounds and the outages, the refinery utilization ought to be in this 90% to 95% range. Once you get all the DOE data worked out to make sure all the refineries do you think shouldn't be in and everything. That's kind of where we see it as well. Operator : Our next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe just 1 quick follow-up on your comments on California from earlier. I know you had talked about some of the longer-term lease issues of low carbon fuel standard credits. Do you have a view on for the next 12 months where you think the LCFS credit go from here? We've gone from 200 to 150-ish. Do you see further downside? Or do you think we stabilize here? Martin Parrish : That's a good question. This is Martin. What's difficult about this is you're always driving with your rearview mirror, right? The last -- the data lags by 6 months and not complained about that. It makes sense. It's a lot of data. But -- so we're always kind of -- we've got -- at the end of this month, we'll get the third quarter data. I think what's interesting is when you look at it, the credit price obviously depends on credit generation versus deficit generation and COVID certainly reduced deficit generation and it has been since the second quarter of '20. So you have to think the credit prices have been reduced by COVID. And then the other thing that's interesting to me is when you look at the credit generation in 2Q '21, I'd say that it certainly surprised me to the upside. But when you dig into that, there's really 2 line items in the credit generation that stand out. The first was that bio CNG, bio compressed natural gas was 13% of all the 2Q '21 credits, and that line item was up 190% versus 2019. And second, off-road electricity generated 9% of all credits. Now this is off-road, not on-road, and that was up 146% versus 2019. And more interestingly, on the off-road, 71% of those credits came from e-forklifts. so when you think about the bio CNG, the off-road, the e-forklifts, you just wonder if that pace of credit generation can continue on the infrastructure and just really the -- gets in the way, right? I don't know how many times you can replace your forklift to get an e-forklift, but it seems like that would run out at some point. So we'll see how that shakes out. But if you think about those 2 line items, that's, what, 21%, 22% of the credits in California from 2 line items there, which really were very small in the past. So that's just kind of an interesting data. And then the other is biodiesel, renewable diesel and on-road electricity credit generation as a percent of total credits were all flat for 2Q '21 versus 2019 as a whole. That's just a little color. Hopefully, that helps. Ryan Todd : That's great. And then maybe just one overall. I know you've talked a lot about what you've seen generally in terms of demand, particularly here in the U.S. Any comments in terms of what you're seeing on the product export side that may indicate what you're seeing on international product demand, particularly in your primary export markets? Gary Simmons : Yes, this is Gary. So I would tell you, we're probably seeing -- we're not seeing the recovery in Latin America quite as fast as we've seen in North America or the UK. So demand is still down a little bit. We're seeing good export demand into the region. I would expect in the first quarter, our exports will be down a little bit, not really an indication of demand in Latin America, but more a function of maintenance activity occurring, especially in the U.S. Gulf Coast during the quarter and really good domestic demand. But the demand is there in Latin America in our typical export markets. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Jason Gabelman : I wanted to dovetail off a comment that was just made, maintenance in the Gulf Coast. It looks like guidance or throughput is down quarter-over-quarter for 1Q from 4Q about 300,000 barrels a day. Can you just discuss if what maintenance activity you're going to have on 1Q, if there are other one-time items impacting that guidance? And if you think that's indicative of the industry as a whole, just given it seems like there was a lot maintenance delayed due to COVID over the past couple of years. And then my second question is, hopefully, one you can answer kind of on geopolitics and what's going on with Russia. Valero imports a lot of intermediate feedstock from Russia and can you just discuss maybe the margin kind of enhancement that provides and how you're more broadly thinking about both the risks and opportunities these geopolitical issues with Russia present for your company? Lane Riggs : So this is Lane. I'll take the first one. So we don't really comment directly on our turnaround activity going into the quarter. The volumes are the proxy for that, so you can just sort of decide what that means. And we certainly don't -- we also don't comment on our peers on what we think they're doing with respect to turnarounds. This is just sort of a policy for us. Joe Gorder : Gary, you want to talk about Russia? Gary Simmons : Yes. So obviously, we don't really until any kind of sanctions are announced, we don't really know what they would entail. What I can tell you is that when we've seen things like this happen in the past in other locations, it simply results in a change in trade flows. So what we would expect to happen here is some of those intermediates that we're running today will be run somewhere else throughout the world. And wherever those end up going, they'll kick out feedstocks that make it available for us to run. So certainly, as a commercial team, we're looking at what those are today and making sure we have them approved in our system and are ready to run them if we need to in the future. Operator : Our next question is coming from Connor Lynagh of Morgan Stanley. Connor Lynagh : Maybe sticking with major exporters. I was wondering what you guys made of the discussion around Pemex potentially ending crude exports? And what do you see as the implications? Do you think it's likely to occur? And what do you think the implications on particularly the Gulf Coast refining industry would be? Gary Simmons : Yes. So this is Gary. I think Lane has been pretty public on our views on being able to meaningfully change refinery reliability and utilization. He's kind of said 2 turnaround cycles and a lot of capital. So it looks like their goals are pretty aggressive. But if they're able to increase refinery utilization, if it does focus refinery starts up, certainly, it would decrease the amount of crude for export. Our view is that the first destinations to be cut will really be European destinations and Asian destinations for export from Mexico. [It goes first]. Our experience has been that as they increase refinery runs in Mexico, they increase the export of high-sulfur fuel oil, and that's a good feedstock for our high complexity U.S. Gulf Coast system that actually serves as a nice complement to a lot of the light sweet grades we run in our U.S. Gulf Coast system. We've had a long-standing great relationship with Pemex, and we expect that to continue long into the future. Connor Lynagh : Got it. Helpful context. Maybe just returning to the capacity question, but in a global sense. The closures, obviously, you had sort of a net decline in some areas and you're sort of at least in theory, flipping back to growth at a global capacity level over the next couple of years here. I mean do you -- are you concerned about that? Do you see that meaningfully altering the -- to your earlier point, product flows or crude flows? Just how do you think about that impact on your margins? Lane Riggs : This is Lane. I mean, we read the same journals you guys do and trade magazines, and we have people that keep up with refinery closures and refineries starting up. Obviously the Middle East has some refinery starting up. China has some. I guess we sort of believe that China has this longer-term plan of having larger refineries run instead of what we call the teapot refineries. But at the end of the day, it's hard to really sort of have a real strong view on where all this really heads. I always go back to when the refinery -- the Indian refinery alliance was starting up, and we were concerned then, and we from our experience were able to review those refineries, stress and calculated their import parity into our marketing. At the end of the day, what happened is most of the barrels stayed in the region. So you just -- these are difficult things to work through. But what we do is we run our assets. We make sure they're competitive not holding here in the U.S. but everywhere in the world. And we know that as long as there's [rent] out there in this industry, we'll get our share of it. So... Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Bhullar for closing comments. Homer Bhullar : Great. Thanks, Donna. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Obviously, if there's anything you want to follow up on, feel free to ping the IR team. Thank you, and have a great week. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll now turn the conference over to Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relation and Finance. Mr. Bhullar, you may now begin. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive President and Chief Commercial Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expertise or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that today, we delivered solid financial results for the first quarter, led by a continued recovery in our Refining segment. Refining margins were supported by strong product demand, coupled with very low product inventories globally. Refinery capacity rationalizations that have taken place in the last couple of years continue to contribute to the supply tightness. In addition, high natural gas prices in Europe are supporting product cracks to compensate for the higher operating costs. This, in turn, provides a structural margin advantage for U.S. refineries particularly those located in the Gulf Coast, where natural gas costs are significantly lower than in Europe. Turning to our low-carbon segments. The ethanol business generated positive operating income despite a weak margin environment and our growing renewable diesel business continues to generate good results with high demand for renewable diesel. We expect low-carbon fuel policies to continue to expand globally and drive demand for low-carbon fuels. And with that view, we're leveraging our operational and technical expertise that steadily expands our competitive advantage. The DGD 3 renewable diesel project located next to our Port Arthur refinery is now expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2022. With the completion of this 470 million-gallon per year plant, DGD\u2019s total annual capacity is expected to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. BlackRock and Navigators large-scale carbon sequestration project is progressing on schedule and is expected to begin start-up activities in late 2024. Valero is expected to be the anchor shipper with 8 ethanol plants connected to this system, which should provide a lower carbon intensity ethanol product and result in higher product margins. We continue to evaluate other low-carbon opportunities such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable hydrogen and additional renewable naphtha and carbon sequestration projects. And in refining, the Port Arthur Coker project, which is expected to increase the refinery's utilization rate and improved turnaround efficiency, is still expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. On the financial side, we remain committed to our capital allocation framework, which prioritizes a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. We further reduced our long-term debt by $750 million in February through debt reduction and refinancing transactions, bringing our total long-term debt reduction to $2 billion in 6 months. And we continue to honor our commitment to stockholder returns with an annual target payout ratio of 40% to 50%. We restarted stock buybacks in the first quarter which, combined with our dividend, returned $545 million to our stockholders. Looking ahead, the fundamentals that drove strong results in the first quarter, particularly in March, continue to provide a positive backdrop for the refining segment. We expect product demand to remain healthy with light products demand near pre-pandemic levels and the pent-up desire to travel and take vacations should drive incremental demand for transportation fuels as we head into the summer. Global product inventories remain low, particularly for diesel and there's less refining capacity available to replenish inventories. In addition, natural gas price disparity between the U.S. and Europe should provide a structural margin advantage for U.S. refiners especially for assets located in the Gulf Coast. In closing, we're encouraged by the refining outlook, which, coupled with our growth strategy and low-carbon fuels should further strengthen our long-term competitive advantage and drive long-term stockholder returns. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the first quarter of 2022, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $905 million or $2.21 per share compared to a net loss of $704 million or $1.73 per share for the first quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $944 million or $2.31 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $666 million or $1.64 per share for the first quarter of 2021. For reconciliations to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany the earnings release. The refining segment reported $1.45 billion of operating income for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $592 million operating loss of the first quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 adjusted operating income was $1.47 billion compared to an adjusted operating loss of $506 million for the first quarter of 2021. Refining throughput volumes in the first quarter of 2022 averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which was 390,000 barrels per day higher than the first quarter of 2021. Throughput capacity utilization was 89% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 77% in the first quarter of 2021. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.73 per barrel in the first quarter of 2022 were $2.05 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2021, which were impacted by excess energy costs related to winter storm Uri. The renewable diesel segment operating income was $149 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $203 million for the first quarter of 2021. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 1.7 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2022, which was 871,000 gallons per day higher than the first quarter of 2021. The higher sales volumes were attributed to the fourth quarter 2021 start-up of the Diamond Green Diesel expansion project or DGD 2. The ethanol segment reported $1 million of operating income for the first quarter of 2022 compared to a $56 million operating loss for the first quarter of 2021. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2022, which was 483,000 gallons per day higher than the first quarter of 2021. For the first quarter of 2022, G&A expenses were $205 million and net interest expense was $145 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $606 million, and the income tax expense was $252 million for the first quarter of 2022. The effective tax rate was 21%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $588 million in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding the unfavourable impact from the change in working capital of $722 million and the other joint venture members, 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion. With regard to investing activities, we made $843 million of capital investments in the first quarter of 2022 of which $536 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and $307 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture members, 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $718 million in the first quarter of 2022. Moving to financing activities. We returned $545 million to our stockholders in the first quarter of 2022, with $401 million paid as dividends and $144 million of stock buybacks, resulting in a payout ratio of 44% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter. With respect to our balance sheet, we completed debt reduction and refinancing transactions in the first quarter that reduced Valero's long-term debt by $750 million. As Joe already noted, these debt reduction and refinancing transactions, combined with the debt reduction and refinancing transactions completed in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 have reduced Valero's long-term debt by $2 billion. At quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $13.2 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $2.6 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 34%. And we ended the quarter well capitalized with $4.9 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We still expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2022 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of that amount is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. About half of the growth capital in 2022 is allocated to expanding our low-carbon businesses. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.64 million to 1.69 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 395,000 to 415,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 225,000 to 245,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 445,000 to 465,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $5.15 per barrel which are higher than last quarter primarily due to higher natural gas prices. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we now expect sales volumes to be approximately 750 million gallons in 2022 with the anticipated start-up of DGD 3 in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses in 2022 should still be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.15 for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 4 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.48 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the second quarter, net interest expense should be about $140 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $630 million. For 2022, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $870 million. That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Doug Leggate : This one might be for Gary, actually or whoever, Joe, you want to allocate it to. But I'm curious about the cadence of the margin trajectory, realized margin trajectory through the quarter. Obviously, the world kind of changed at the end of February. But what we're trying to really get a handle on is what the kind of sustainable earnings momentum might look like, given what we saw in March and obviously, stronger crack indicators again in April. So that's my first question, the cadence of margins through the quarter and what it looks like in April so far. Gary Simmons : Yes, Doug. So I would tell you, in the first quarter, we saw is really pretty strong distillate demand throughout the quarter. But to start first quarter, gasoline demand was a little bit soft. We had a wave of COVID go through, which impacted mobility. And so the quarter started with a little softer gasoline demand but it recovered rapidly throughout the quarter. So by the end of the quarter, we were seeing gasoline demand at or slightly above pre-pandemic levels. We are seeing distillate demand above pre-pandemic levels and that demand being met with significantly less refinery capacity as we had rationalization that occurred during the pandemic. So, really tight supply demand bounce and then very, very low product inventories. . So we're looking at a situation where total light product inventory is 41 million barrels below the 5-year average. So very, very tight, especially tight for diesel. Diesel inventories in the U.S. 27 million barrels below the 5-year average. So the strength in crack spreads really been led by diesel. As long as inventories remain low, you would expect that to translate into very strong refining margin environment. And in fact, so far in April, we've seen stronger margins than we even had in March. What we expect to see throughout the quarter is ultimately, as we get into driving season and gasoline demand continues to pick up, you're going to have to have compression between gasoline cracks and diesel cracks. A lot of the VGO that comes into the United States to fill conversion capacity West source from Russia. So VGO is tight. And we're going to have competition between an incremental barrel going to an FCC to make gasoline versus that barrel going to a hydrocracker to make diesel. So we would expect gasoline cracks to get stronger as we move through the second quarter. Joe Gorder : Sorry, Gary, to press you on this, but maybe I'll ask it like this, how much of the earnings in the quarter from refining were in March? Gary Simmons : Doug, we can't give you a breakdown of earnings. But I think as Gary highlighted, obviously, March was a significant contributor. Doug Leggate : Okay. Sorry for trying. My follow-up is really on Joe's prepared remarks about structural cost advantage. Joe, I think you know where we stand on this. Our view is that the U.S. has moved into almost like a regional golden age given your structural cost opportunities and the rationalization of capacity here. I'm wondering if you could just offer us some color on how we quantify the -- whether that advantage looks like given you've got Pembroke as a benchmark relative to the U.S. What is the delta right now? And do you see -- what would you hazard guess at as kind of normalized go-forward spread between U.S. and European gas as it relates to refining? Joe Gorder : Yes, Doug, that's a good question. Let's let Lane take a whack at it here. Lane Riggs : Yes. So as you alluded to, we have the Penbrook refinery, so we have a little bit of insight on this. So if you sort of today, our natural gas prices over in the U.K. are roughly about $30 per million BTU, sort of look at the United States and we're currently paying somewhere between $5, $6, $6.5. If you specifically use $30 versus $5, you need about an $8 per barrel higher heat crack sort of breakeven -- Pembroke to breakeven versus the Gulf Coast asset. Doug Leggate : And is that kind of ratable as we -- if we normalize the long end of the curve right now, it shows about a $5-plus spread per Mcf. So that would just be kind of ratable so would be like $1.5 or something like that way? Lane Riggs : Well, I'm not quite following what I would say is you split the burden of saying, \"Hey, I get this - what he cracked do I need from Pembroke versus the Gulf Coast, I need about an $8 per barrel higher heat crack. If I'm paying $30 per million BTU for gas in the U.K. versus sort of $5 in the U.S. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Roger Read : Probably a little bit to follow up on how we think about the second quarter here and capture and kind of contrast that with the guidance on volume. So the guidance on volumes would imply some more maintenance going on this quarter. So as we think about higher crude prices, lower secondary box I'll call it, kind of stratospheric diesel cracks and how we should think about the moving parts here affecting capture for you all. Lane Riggs : Yes. This is Lane. So I've sort of been talking about this as we've been on the road. I mean it's very difficult right now to sort of compare previous capture rates versus the index as they are today. As you said, first and foremost, it's backwardation the crude markets and the product market. Secondarily, it's our secondary products like propylene and pet coke and asphalt and others that don't move quite as fast as crude has moved up in price. And of course, finally, we had quite a bit of turnaround activity in the first quarter. We're giving our volume guidance in terms of how the second quarter looks, but I think going forward, as long as there's this much backwardation in the market, we'll make -- trying to figure out what the margin capture is going to be on a go-forward basis, a little more difficult. Roger Read : Well, at least you got plenty of room to work with given where the crack spreads are. A follow-up question. So end of the quarter cash, if I remember correctly, was $2-something billion. Joe, at the last management meeting at the beginning of April, you talked about maybe being more comfortable or you did, maybe, Jason, to carrying $4 billion of cash. You restarted the share repos here in Q1. Presumably, those will keep going. What's the right way to think about maybe hitting the upper end of the 40% to 50% or exceeding the $50, do you want to get to the 4 billion in cash first is it more to debt to pay down? Just kind of walk us through before what we should think about as we think about better-than-expected cash flows, I think most of us had coming into the year and how that may play out as we go through the rest of this year. Jason Fraser : This is Jason. I'll take a shot at it. No, you're right, you hit our three goals, which we've talked about, and we'll try to do simultaneously. We want to build up cash. We want to continue to pay down debt. We paid down $2 billion over the past 6 months. And also to -- definitely on our commitment to our shareholders with the buyback. So I believe with what we did in the first quarter, we were at about 44% on the share buybacks with regard to the payout ratio, and we will still look at it on an annual basis. And you said we're at 2.6 on cash. So we're not even at -- we talked about having at least three probably going forward as a minimum, of course, it will vary around, but that's kind of what we're looking at. So we'll build some more cash. We don't have any maturities coming due, while we have a small one next quarter, but we'll be looking at opportunistic to get repurchases as we move forward. Yes. So we'll try to do them all simultaneously. We don't have an order where we'll get up to $4 billion of cash before we do X or anything like that. Joe Gorder : Roger, the only thing I'd add to what Jason said is we live one day at a time in this business for sure. But if you look at what we're looking at in the market today, you feel pretty comfortable with the ability to go ahead and achieve all those things that we mentioned, building some cash as we go forward, we thought it was opportunistic to buy back shares with the outlook that we had for the market going forward. And so we went ahead and did it, and we've got our commitment to honor the payout ratio target. And so Jason said it right. We're looking at doing all three of them simultaneously. But I guess what it speaks to from my perspective is kind of the general outlook that we have on the market going forward and that we're going to be able to achieve all of these three things with the way things appear to be right now. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gresh : One follow-up to that, just as we think about the balance sheet and the fact that you effectively approach the leverage target side of the equation. If this is a really strong environment or a peakish type of year, would you consider moving the leverage target lower? A lot of question marks out there, recession risk or other things. Just curious how you're thinking about kind of managing through cycles from leverage. Jason Fraser : Yes, this is Jason. We're pretty comfortable with our 20% to 30% range. It definitely gives us range to get a lot lower than we are now. I believe we're at 34% now. So we still got a little ways to get down to our -- the upper end of our target. And of course, we can do that by holding cash or paying down debt. So we'll look at both of those tools. But yes, I mean I think we're comfortable with the range and it gives us a lot of flexibility within it. Phil Gresh : And then just on DGD I think you've talked about a go-forward capture rate there on the gross margin, somewhere around 100%. The capture rate was definitely better in 1Q relative to some of the headwinds in 4Q. I was just curious if there were any other headwinds there in 1Q to think about that might have been transitory and just how you're thinking about the go-forward margin outlook? Martin Parrish : Phil, this is Martin. You're right. The capture rate improved in 1Q versus 4Q. 4Q, the issue was really feedstock costs relative to soybean oil and actually priced above soybean oil or feedstock. And as we talked about before, that was largely due to the DGD 2 getting into the pit changing feedstock flows. And every time we've done that in the past, when we've expanded, we've seen feedstock prices go up. The good news in the first quarter is feedstock prices moderated relative to soybean oil actually, they ended the quarter below soybean oil. So that all looks good. So the -- what impacted margin capture in the first quarter was really the backwardation that Lane's talked about that prompt crack is just not achievable. So that was the issue. So it's really the backwardation in the ULSD market that impacted the capture. And as long as we have that backwardation, we'll have -- will lag on the capture but that won't be a permanent thing. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Connor Lynagh : Just high level on distillate and distillate inventories. I mean, do you attribute the supply tightness entirely to what's been happening in Europe either on the natural gas cost side of things or the outright disruptions in Russia? Or do you feel there's some sort of bigger global issue here? Gary Simmons : Well, I think it's a number of factors. But certainly, as I alluded to, distillate demand has remained fairly strong throughout the pandemic, and you're trying to supply that demand with less refining capacity as we've had rationalization occur in the industry. I think you couple with the fact that we came through a period of time where there was a lot of maintenance activity. People trying to catch up from maintenance that maybe didn't occur during the pandemic. So you saw low refinery utilization. And then you add to it the natural gas presenting challenges in Europe and less Russian distillate flowing into the market as well, and it kind of puts us in the position where we're in. Connor Lynagh : I guess the -- we're sort of driving at this is as we look into summer driving season and presumably further recovery in jet demand, is there a slack that you guys see in the global refining system or in the U.S. refining system to really significantly increase runs and refill those inventories? Or do you think we need to see some sort of demand destruction to balance the market? Gary Simmons : It's hard to see that refinery utilization can increase much. We've been in this 93% utilization and historically although we've been able to hit 93% utilization, generally, you can't sustain it for long periods of time. So I don't think there's a lot of room on refinery utilization in terms of increasing supply. I think the markets will have to balance more on the demand side. . Connor Lynagh : And just to sneak one more. And do you think that's more likely on the gasoline diesel or jet side? Or how would you think about that in terms of product? Gary Simmons : Well, I think it depends. In the domestic market, it looks like jet demand is recovering nicely. Certainly, you'll have an impact to international travel still with COVID restrictions in place, some places and then high prices impacting some air travel as well. Gasoline and diesel seem very constructive and a lot of it is -- we have still a lot of pent-up demand. People that have been unable to travel for a couple of years are ready to go out and take vacation. And so in our mind, we'll see very good demand continue for both gasoline and diesel. . Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Paul Cheng : Actually, you mentioned earlier about the backwardation curve. I think we all understand how the crew market deputation curve will impact on the margin capture. I'm not sure I fully understand how the port up backwardation curve will impact on the margin capture or the profitability. Can you maybe help me understand a little bit better on that? That's the first question. Lane Riggs : And so I'll take a shot and maybe Gary can firm it up. When you're trading in the cycle, right, if the crack is rolling up towards you and you're out there sort of selling into it, you're not necessarily capturing the peak number all the time. It's just -- we've had days where the diesel crack has gone up $0.20 a gallon, $0.30. So you're not going to hit it perfectly. And of course, since we raised a ratable book and we're sort of fully hedged, there again, it's a little bit more difficult for us to fully capture a steeply backward distillate market. . Paul Cheng : Does that mean that your vehicles in a commercial market your category will benefit? Lane Riggs : Yes, for products. Yes, what structure is telling you is that the world is short, right? It's either short -- that's what structure is telling you. So yes, your commercial alarms actually do pretty well in a contango market. It's just the underlying crack is not necessarily as good as you would like. Paul Cheng : And in the crude market, this is in [indiscernible] or contango, I mean, we can pretty much do a relatively easy estimate? What's the impact from the CMA. Is there any rule of thumb that is the variation curve in the product market? Is it a dollar to dollar impact on your margin capture or not really is a fraction and it is a fraction, is there any from what percentage that may be? Lane Riggs : No, it's not as transparent because so many of our barrels are essentially brent-based. And so we have to look at the overall sort of dated market and sort of how we build up to get from sort of the physical market to an ICE relationship. So it's a little not as transparent, and it's not as easy to see, but you can -- obviously, you can look at what something similar to the complex role of that to see. Is it really -- is it a -- it's actually backward or not? And then just look have to sort of come up with how you guys want to model that. . Paul Cheng : The second question is on the Russian innovation and correspondingly I mean there's a lot of moving parts. I mean, the European gas price is high, the feedstock availability on video or those have become reduced. And we've also seen, of course, that the product export from Russia in gas oil to Europe has been dramatically reduced. So how that your operation in Europe, Pembroke and also maybe that your Gulf Coast refining operation had been changed or more and adopt to this new, I mean, is the product yield had been any meaningful differences because of the market condition or the current situation that we see. And also that because you no longer can buy the M100 when you purchase the other similar type from Latin America or Middle East how that impact on your product yield on your operation? Lane Riggs : Again, I'll say, hey, Paul, I'll take a shot and Gary can correct anything that I say that's not exactly correct. . So starting with the first item, VGO definitely, when you look at how the Russian balances were VGO is essentially -- they're the final sort of exporter of a major -- a major physical supply of VGO to the market. And so we'll just have to see how that plays out. Today, it's not because the diesel crack is so high versus gasoline, you're still in that diesel. I mean Gary kind of touched upon it earlier. I think our anticipation is as you get more into the driving season, as you -- you sort of -- you enter into a period where maybe it's a little more difficult to fill up these conversion units because of the availability of gas. You'll have to start bidding molecules away from the distillate market. And as long as the distillate market remains tight, it is just going to keep pulling up both cracks. We'll just have to see how that works out. With respect to our M100 supply, we're out buying sort of replacement barrels in the areas that you alluded to, which is largely the Middle East and South America. We'd have been buying those in the base if they were the most economic or we've certainly been able to certainly shore up our supply situation with those with barrels from those areas. Paul Cheng : But in the dose barrel when you run through your refinery, do they yield differently or do you need to change the way how you operate? Lane Riggs : Well, we're blending differently, right? So what it means is -- because, yes, all these feedstock even M100 has variability from different areas and all these intermediates have different variability and qualities. And we're always -- I mean that's part of the sausage making. We figure out how to blend to something that we think is the most economic for us to run. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Theresa Chen : I have a follow-up question, Lane, on some of the comments around demand and gasoline. Clearly, there's a lot of concern on demand currently and much of that is driven by factors abroad that's outside of your control. But I was hoping if you could offer your thoughts on how elastic do you think that demand curve is currently. And you're already in like a tight product supply situation due to rationalization alone. And now the Russian VGO is coming out of the market. And to your point, the gas crackers, you just incentivize that barrel of VGO from the hydrocracker, which means that gasoline cracks need to go higher and if crude doesn't go lower prices used to go higher. So how does all that shake out as far as the demand picture goes for you? Gary Simmons : Theresa, this is Gary. So it's difficult to tell at what price point do you see demand destruction on gasoline. I think there's a number of factors that come into play there. Certainly, you would expect elevated price to have an impact on demand. However, we've seen wage inflation that kind of offsets that and allows people to tolerate a higher price point with personal savings up again, people pent-up demand. They're going to want to travel and they have money in the bank. So it probably offset some of that to some degree. And then throughout the world, not so much in the U.S., but in many other countries, we've seen the government step in, in the form of tax subsidies ways to kind of offset those increases and keep the street price down. So I think a lot of those factors will kind of offset some of the things that we typically see and that would cause the demand destruction to occur on gasoline. Theresa Chen : And just on the export side, what are you seeing in terms of the competitive dynamics in the export markets? Clearly, you're well positioned given your geographical concentration in the Gulf Coast. How do you see the market evolve or Gulf Coast refiners as domestic supply has rationalized to some extent, and LatAm continues to grow over time. There seems to be a structural bid for diesel into Europe, given their shortage. How do you see these factors playing out? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think as long as you know, when you look at the advantages, the U.S. Gulf Coast refining system has -- we've talked a lot about natural gas, but also feedstock cost advantages running domestic crude or Canadian or Mexican crude. It puts us in a very strong position to be able to compete globally into the export markets. And I think you'll see that continue. PADD 3 is long diesel. And so you'll see that length move into the export markets, Latin America and Europe throughout the summer. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Please proceed with your question. Paul Sankey : These are have much follow-up questions. Pretty much follow-up questions, given everything you said. Just specifically, do you have a number for how much Russian crude and I guess, VGOs into media and then Russian products that is now out of the market further to what you're saying. And it seems that you're saying that trade remains strong despite the strong dollar and the high prices. And the follow-up would be on the working capital movement, how is the environment affecting your trading and markets in general because we're all aware that there's been a falling off of open interest. I assume that the working capital commitment will stay high as long as prices stay high. But if there's anything you can add on what it means for markets, that would be very helpful. Gary Simmons : Yes. So I guess to start with, we have seen -- it looks like diesel coming out of Russia and M100 coming out of Russia have fallen off. Thus far, we haven't really seen the fall off in crude exports from Russia. So far, it looks like it's been more of a rebalancing of trade flows rather than a reduction in exports. You can see India taking more Russian barrels, China taking more Russian barrels. Some Latin grades in West African grades flowing into Europe. And then in here in the United States, you're seeing a more Brazilian and Colombian grades that we're going to India and China starting to flow in the U.S. So I don't know that we've seen so much on the crude export side, but certainly on the M100, the resids and the distillate, you're starting to see export fall off. Working capital discussion Lane Riggs : Paul, this is Lane. I'll take a shot at it. This is what you're trying to get at. One of the things that you've seen in the working capital ideas is that with this tiny traded derivatives market, the paper markets, it's sort of is trying -- what you're seeing is the trading companies and the operating companies are trying to sort out who's going to have the physical length that's going either across the Atlantic or to South America, depending on trade flow, and it's because there's just -- this volatility is an derivative market. And so everybody is trying to -- that's still being sorted out, I guess, is the best way I would say that. . Paul Sankey : If I just sneak in a quick follow-up. Your light sweet crude, they look like they are an all-time record high at the moment, right? Lane Riggs : Yes, they are. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Manav Gupta : I'm going to try for one. I'm not sure if I get the answer, but it's my job to try. So if we go back a decade, 2015 was the best year in earnings. And let me know how if I'm wrong, but I think you made over $9 in EPS in '15. So when we move forward today, first quarter 2.31. The next two quarters, most of us who really believe in Valero believe there's like an $8 or $9 EPS number hidden there combined for the 2 quarters. And then the last quarter is generally our strongest. So that's another 2.50. We put all three things together this high that will be achieved in 2022 will be materially higher than the 2015 earnings number. If I'm thinking about it right, can you comment about how the management is thinking about a record high earnings in over a decade. Joe Gorder : So Manav, I'll just say that -- I said it earlier, we live one day at a time. And we certainly like your thinking and your mindset. And frankly, I think everything you've heard from the team this morning is that things look constructive on all segments of our business right now. And so we're optimistic, but we don't cut our chickens before they're hatched. So we'll continue to do what we do, and that is coming every day and try to operate safely and reliably in an environmentally responsible way and to optimize to the extent we can. And if we just keep doing that day after day after day, I think we're going to find ourselves in a really good place. Manav Gupta : And one quick follow-up here is, every quarter, we see a very positive trend. DGD moves ahead by one quarter. And so if you spot that trend, the logical conclusion here is that on your 2Q call, you would basically say that we have achieved mechanical completion and we are starting the RD projects. I'm just sporting a trend here, sir. So let me know what you think about that. Joe Gorder : Well, Martin, do you want to? Martin Parrish : Well, obviously, we've got a long track record here and we -- DGD 3 is pretty much a duplicate of two, just a little bit bigger. So that helped a lot, same construction teams, same contractors, perfect weather. So we got to get through hurricane season still, Manav, but yes, everything looks great over at Port Arthur. Joe Gorder : Manav, the one thing that I would say, too, and we don't talk about it a lot, but our team's ability to execute major projects like this. I mean, Lane has really worked very hard on this over the years and our team's ability to execute significant projects and the partners that we've got helping execute those prospects are extraordinary. And at least to the kind of results that you said look like a trend, and it's a trend that we like and we'll try to maintain. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Neil Mehta : First question is on the U.S. Gulf Coast. We've seen a lot of capacity retirement down there, whether it was Lyondell here recently, obviously, Shell can and then the alliance refining assets as well, something like 7% capacity is now out of the market as of next year. How do you guys see that impacting the structural outlook of the U.S. Gulf Coast? And what changes of that anything? Or is that market just so deep and interconnected that retirement doesn't have a meaningful impact on the way you think about product basis? Gary Simmons : Yes, I would say, overall, Neil, PADD 3 is an export market on both gasoline and diesel. So I wouldn't expect to see a material impact from shutdown capacity in terms of the product market. We do see it gives us some advantages on the crude stock. We've certainly seen that as refineries come down, especially those refineries in the Eastern Gulf. It gives us access to some U.S. grades that maybe we didn't have access to before. Neil Mehta : And the follow-up is also on the product markets, and I just love your perspective on what's happening in China right now. Certainly, it looks like a couple of million barrels a day, product demand could be down, but at the same time, China is not exporting product into the market in a meaningful way. And so Singapore margins continue to be very strong. But as you look at the balances here, -- how much of a concern is China? And -- do you think that, again, that impact could be contained because of inventory levels but also product quotas? Gary Simmons : Well, Neil, I think it really -- the answer is kind of in what you just stated. Thus far, although certainly, the COVID restrictions have impacted demand in China, they're not exporting a lot of product. So I think if you had weak demand in China and high refinery utilization resulting in very high exports, that would be concerning, but we're not seeing that in the market today. . Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question Sam Margolin : Question on capital allocation. A significant amount of your growth CapEx is low-carbon projects, and those projects come early, but they're very regimented process. And just because a project comes early doesn't mean the next one is going to start early. So you might develop kind of a lumpy pattern of growth CapEx. And I'm just wondering if that has an effect on your on the other elements of your capital allocation, the other components, return on capital or if you harvest that cash, what happens when you have maybe a lean year in growth CapEx just because of the cadence of your gated process. Joe Gorder : So you're saying if we have a year -- in a lean year for growth CapEx, you're talking about a year where we spend less on growth CapEx? Sam Margolin : Yes, because if you finish DGD 3 early, it doesn't mean you're going to start the next one early as well, right, because you're still going through the process for it. So you might have a gap in spending given the magnitude of your growth CapEx in that portion. . Joe Gorder : No. Got you. Lane Riggs : Okay. Sam, so it's Lane. I'll take a stab. So it's an interesting idea. And I do think you'll see our strategic capital and as well as our sustaining capital, we've always said that we guide to 2% to 2.5% on the overall capital budget, nominally 1.5%. These are all averages. So by definition, our strategic capital is going to be 0.5 billion to 1 billion normally on an average. And the -- we are -- it will be lumpier because they are sizable projects and so I think direction of that is true from -- potentially from a year-to-year, I don't think you'll see us go from 0 to $2 billion or something like that, but you'll certainly see a $0.5 billion of variability with respect to our strategic capital spend here in the near term. And you want to comment Jason Fraser : Yes, it just fits in the bar with excess cash. I don't think we'd change our model based on the variability and growth CapEx. Lane Riggs : Right. Joe Gorder : Yes. I mean Sam, I think it was mentioned earlier, Jason mentioned earlier, we haven't yet achieved the three targets that we're shooting for as far as the use of cash, whether it be the debt ratio buybacks and so on. So we've got a little bit of work to do around that yet, but building a little bit of cash that never is very troubling to us. Sam Margolin : Yes. And this is sort of a follow-up, and it is kind of a hypothetical around DGD 4. We're talking a lot on this call about clear evidence of a distillate shortage that's driven by some structural factors. And so now you have a consideration for renewable diesel supply that goes beyond just policy and the regulatory framework because we just need more diesel period, renewable or otherwise. And so I'm wondering if that's a consideration that's now going into the commercial analysis behind incremental R&D projects. Martin Parrish : Yes, Sam, this is Martin. I'm not sure we've looked at it that way. But overall, I would just tell you the demand for renewable diesel, we look at the balances, we just think that demand is going to outstrip supply. And we've got a lot of speculation is coming on. We'll see how much of that happens. But we feel good about supply, the European demand for renewable diesel. We feel good about demand. Demand for renewable diesel in Europe is going to rebound a lot with no more COVID lockdowns has been the case. So we got RED 2 out through 2030 and we're talking about in the Fit for 55 program, what they're going to do for the RED 3 is pretty aggressive. So -- and then California, Oregon, Washington, the CFS in Canada. So we just see a lot of demand out there. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Todd : Maybe just a couple of high-level strategic ones. I mean, clearly, we've talked a lot here about how attractive the setup is for the rest of this year with markets that can tight and margins strong. Outside of a potential recession, what risks do you worry about that could materially change the outlook, Joe? Joe Gorder : Well, I mean, if we ended up in a huge recession, I think those are the kind of things that certainly are out of our control, but it would likely affect demand. And another bout of COVID that would shut down people's mobility would impact us. But outside noncontrollable factors like that right now, I mean, I just -- I think we're generally pretty bullish about the way things look. You add anything? Lane Riggs : No. I mean, those comments are right. I mean we didn't at least -- I do think people -- my own personal -- I think people's tolerance of COVID is a little different than the last time. So I don't know that we'll see the demand destruction COVID sort of some form of variant of COVID comes running through for whatever reason. But the recession has to be our biggest risk at this point. . Joe Gorder : Yes. Ryan Todd : Right. And then maybe it feels like it's been a long time since you've been in the market for the purchase of refining asset. But I wonder if you have any comment on developments in the refining asset market. Particularly, we have news of a failed sale process for the Lyondell refinery. Is this just a gap in bid-ask range you're seeing? Or do you see it as increasingly difficult for large assets to transact going forward? And if that's the case, what does it mean for medium- to longer-term supply/demand balances globally? Is this -- are we more likely to see more closures versus sales going forward in keeping markets tighter than they might be otherwise? Joe Gorder : Well, I mean, probably the safest way for us to talk about that is from our own perspective. And there haven't been assets in the market that were compelling for us to buy. That doesn't mean there aren't attractive assets that we'd be interested in. But with our experience in acquisitions of assets, you go through the periods of being super enthusiastic about it, and then you get deal heat, you want to go do it and then you buy it and then you get in there and you start looking at it and Lane tells me it's going to cost $3 billion to get it up to a Valero standard, and I look at it maybe that wasn't exactly the best thing. So for us, truly, it is simply a matter of asset allocation, Ryan. I mean where do we want to spend our money. And right now, it's not that these assets aren't good or aren't attractive. It's just we feel we've got higher return, better uses for the capital we want to employ than buy on a refinery that's on the market at this point in time. So I'll stop there. Anything you would add, you guys. Lane Riggs : This is Lane. I do think what it does mean is that you potentially versus transacting a large refinery or even certainly smaller ones, the likelihood that they may shut down is probably direct. At least directionally versus the past is more likely and that's what we're seeing. Operator : Our final question this today comes from the line of Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Gabelman : I have two. The first will be a follow-up on the refining margin outlook. We're getting a lot of inbounds asking how long this strong margin environment can last and you've obviously been very bullish on the call. But maybe a couple of near-term things we've seen that I was hoping to get your comment on. One is the kind of somewhat rapidly tightening spread between European gas prices and U.S. natural gas prices. Do you think that impacts the margin environment at all? Could you see Europe increase utilization on some of its secondary distillate processing units? And then the other one is the IA suggesting that there could be a 5 million-barrel per day increase in refining throughput from now through summer as refining capacity, as maintenance comes back, which is kind of double the typical rate, I think you would see over that period. Just wondering if that factors into your bullish outlook on refining and if you expect either of those to weigh on the market at all? And then I have a quick follow-up on capital allocation. Lane Riggs : So this is Lane. I'll start off. Your first node of seeing it rapidly are closing the arbitrage between you say European gas and U.S. gas has -- there's a barrier there because these export facilities are full. So to the extent that, that will happen, you need to get some more export you got to get to where you have open capacity on the liquid natural gas facilities have to be, have open capacity to fully get there. And so you need to you kind of get a need to go out there and look at what pace and when the next ones are all being built. In terms of refining -- worldwide refining capacity and how we think about it, we keep saying all along, we don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out what the rest of the world is doing on this. You guys have the same data that we have. We focus on doing what we do well, and that's what we focus on. With that said, I mean, there's going to be refinery closures based on the rest of the call that we've talked about versus certain parts of the world are going to build refineries. And so but we don't -- we certainly -- at least we don't worry so much about how these balances are going to necessarily affect us. Jason Gabelman : And then just a quick follow-up on capital allocation moving forward. It seems like you have this coker project and then after that, no major refining projects, but you've been discussing some other low-carbon energy investments. Is the intention for over time, more of the growth capital or nearly all of it to kind of gravitate towards that low-carbon bucket? Joe Gorder : I wouldn't say that by any stretch. I mean, we -- you know our MO, right? We talk about stuff after we fully developed it, understand how much it's going to cost and have a good feel for the market. And so I think it's fair for you to assume that Lane and the team are looking at all the projects and we evaluate them against each other. I wouldn't want to tell you that there'll never be another refining project, but I can tell you a lot of the stuff that's in the hopper that he and the team are looking at tend to be more towards the cleaner fuel side. But honestly, I would never say never on another great project. Homer Bhullar : Great. Thanks. Thank you, everyone. We appreciate you guys dialing in.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to Valero's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relation. Thank you. Please go ahead. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive President and Chief Commercial Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our Web site at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our team maximized refining run rates in the second quarter, while executing our long-standing commitment to safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible operations. In fact, we've been increasing throughput since 2020, as demand recovered along with the easing of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Our refinery utilization rate increased from the pandemic low of 74% in the second quarter of 2020, to 94% in the second quarter of 2022. Refining margins in the second quarter were supported by continued strength in product demand, coupled with low product inventories and continued energy cost advantage for U.S. refineries compared to global competitors. Product supply is constrained as a result of significant refinery capacity rationalization that was triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, driving the shutdown of marginal refineries and conversion of several refineries to product low-carbon fuels. In addition, the Russia-Ukraine conflict intensified the supply tightness with less Russian products in the global market. However, product demand has been strong due to the summer driving season and pent up demand for travel. Valero continues to maximize refinery throughput to help supply the market at this time when global product inventories are at historically low levels. Our low-carbon Renewable Diesel and Ethanol segments also performed well in the quarter. The Renewable Diesel segment had record production volumes as the DGD expansion, DGD 2 ramped up to full capacity. On the strategic front, we remain on track with our growth projects that reduced costs and improve margin capture. The Port Arthur Coker project, which is expected to increase the refinery's throughput capacity, while also improving turnaround efficiency, is expected to be completed in the first-half of 2023. As for low-carbon projects, the DGD 3 renewable diesel project, located next to our Port Arthur refinery, is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2022. The completion of this 470 million gallon per year plan is expected to nearly double DGD's total annual capacity to approximately 1.2. billion gallons of renewable diesel, and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. BlackRock and Navigator's carbon sequestration project is progressing on schedule, and is expected to begin startup activities in late-2024. We're expected to be the anchor shipper, with eight of our ethanol plants connected to this system, which should provide a lower carbon-intensity ethanol product, and generate higher product margins. And we continue to evaluate other low-carbon opportunities, such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable hydrogen, and additional renewable naphtha and carbon sequestration projects. On the financial side, we remain committed to our capital allocation framework, which prioritizes a strong balance sheet, and an investment-grade credit rating. We incurred $4 billion of incremental debt in 2020 during the low-margin environment resulting from the pandemic. Since then, we've reduced our debt by $2.3 billion, including a $300 million reduction in June, and will evaluate further de-leveraging opportunities going forward. In summary, we remain focused on safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible operations, and on maximizing system throughput to provide the essential products that the world needs. And we continue to strengthen our long-term competitive advantage through refining optimization projects, and to grow our business through innovative low carbon fuels that enhance the margin capability of our portfolio. So, with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the second quarter of 2022, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $4.7 billion or $11.57 per share compared to $162 million or $0.39 per share for the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $4.6 billion or $11.36 per share for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $260 million or $0.63 per share for the second quarter of 2021. For reconciliations to adjusted amounts, please refer to the earnings release and the accompanying financial tables. The refining segment reported $6.2 billion of operating income for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $349 million for the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating income was $6.1 billion for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $442 million for the second quarter of 2021. Refining throughput volumes in the second quarter of 2022 averaged $3 million barrels per day, which was 127,000 barrels per day higher than the second quarter of 2021. Throughput capacity utilization was 94% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 90% in the second quarter of 2021. Refining cash operating expenses of $5.20 per barrel in the second quarter of 2022 were $1.07 per barrel higher than the second quarter of 2021 primarily attributed to higher natural gas prices. Renewable Diesel segment operating income was $152 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $248 million for the second quarter of 2021. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged $2.2 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2022, which was 1.3 million gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2021. The higher sales volumes were attributed to DGD 2's operations which started up in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Ethanol segment reported $101 million of operating income for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $99 million for the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating income which primarily excludes the gain from the sale of our Jefferson ethanol plant whose operations were idle than 2020, was $79 million for the second quarter of 2022. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.9 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2022. For the second quarter of 2022, G&A expenses were $233 million and net interest expense was $142 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $602 million, and income tax expense was $1.3 billion for the second quarter of 2022 The effective tax rate was 22%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.8 billion in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of $594 million and the other joint venture member 50% share of DGD's net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $5.2 billion. With regard to investing activities, we made $653 million of capital investments in the second quarter of 2022. Of which, $298 million was for sustaining the business including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance, and $355 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture members, 50% share of DGD and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $524 million in the second quarter of 2022 Moving to financing activities, earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly common stock dividend of $0.98 per share payable on September 1, to holders of record on August 4. We returned 42% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders through dividends and stock buybacks in the quarter, which is at the low-end of our annual 40% to 50% target payout ratio. With respect to our balance sheet, we completed another debt reduction transaction in the second quarter that reduced Valero's debt by $300 million. As Joe already noted, this transaction combined with the debt reduction and refinancing transactions completed in the second-half of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 have collectively reduced Valero's debt by $2.3 billion. We ended the quarter with $10.9 billion of total debt, $2 billion of finance lease obligations, and $5.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt to capitalization ratio net of cash and cash equivalents was 25%, down from the pandemic high of 40% at the end of March 2021, which was largely the result of the debt incurred during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we ended the quarter well-capitalized with $4.6 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance, we expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2022 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts, and joint venture investments. About 60% of that amount is allocated to sustaining the business, and 40% to growth. About half of the growth capital in 2022 is allocated to expanding our low carbon fuels businesses. For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.72 million to 1.77 million barrels per day, Mid Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 255,000 to 275,000 barrels per day, and North Atlantic at 445,000 to 465,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be approximately $5.40 per barrel, which is higher than the second quarter, primarily due to higher energy costs. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 750 million gallons in 2022, with the anticipated start up of DGD 3 in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses in 2022 should be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 3.9 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expense should average $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the third quarter, net interest expense should be about $140 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $640 million. For 2022, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $870 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Please respect this request to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Manav Gupta of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Manav Gupta : Guys, I'm going to actually ask only one question, and that is basically can you help us understand the demand dynamics out there? There were some worries on demand destruction, and then there were some worries on recessionary demand. The conversations we are having indicates that's not the case, but you have the most diversified footprint. So, help us understand, gasoline or diesel, what are you seeing in terms of demand out there? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Manav. Gary Simmons : Manav, this is Gary. I can tell you, through our wholesale channel there is really no indication of any demand destruction. In June, we actually set sales records; we sold 911,000 barrels a day in the month of June, which surpassed our previous record, in August of '18, where we did 904,000 barrels a day. We read a lot about demand destruction and mobility data showing in that range of 3% to 5% demand destruction. Again, we're not seeing in our system. We did see a bit of a lull the first couple of weeks of July, but our seven-day averages now are back to kind of that June level with gasoline at pre-pandemic levels, and diesel continuing to trend above pre-pandemic levels. Manav Gupta : Thank you, guys, and congrats on a very good quarter. Joe Gorder : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : Great quarter, team, very impressive. Joe Gorder : Thanks. Theresa Chen : In light of the macro developments both on the supply side and the demand side, what are your thoughts about where the mid-cycle crack is at now structurally? Joe Gorder : You guys want to -- Lane Riggs : Well, Theresa, this is Lane, I'll take a crack at it, and Gary can tune me a little bit. But, obviously right now it's significantly above the mid-cycle or at least our view of mid-cycle, and then probably anybody else's, for that matter. But with that said, you got to remember our idea of mid-cycle is we go through an entire economic cycle, i.e., from recession to recession. And so, that's kind of -- it's descriptive and defined, and we work through those numbers with few adjustments. But I think we believe, at least we --- the world seems to be trending in a place where the -- through the next economic cycle for a number of reasons, whether it's just sort of the way the energy transition is working for the lack of investment in fossil fuels. For a number of these types of reasons we sort of see that the -- probably be above what -- where our mid-cycle is today for the next economic cycle. Gary Simmons : Yes, I agree with what Lane said. Really, our market outlook calls for a prolonged period where we would be above what we currently have as mid-cycle. And there's a number of structural changes. When you talk about high energy costs as a result of higher natural gas costs, in the U.S. we have lower feed stocks cost due to our proximity to crude natural gas. And then you're getting refiners that are now having to pay some form of a carbon tax, which raises their cost as well. So, as long as the supply and demand balances are tight, and there's a call on that capacity, it would be logical to assume it's going to start to reset that mid-cycle level. Theresa Chen : Thank you. And kind of piggyback on Manav's question related to demand, if we do see a period of demand contraction or demand softness, what do you think the risk is at this point for the industry, as a whole, to build overwhelming amounts of inventories given that the refining industry just lived through two-and-a-half years of having to be extremely flexible, shutting down capacity, et cetera, to run through the pandemic. Gary Simmons : Yes, so, I -- again, kind of referring back to those structural advantages we have in the U.S. on feedstock costs and the energy costs and freight advantages going to South American, we feel like we're in such a strong competitive position even if demand fell here in the United States, we would be able to export volume and be competitive doing that in South America. Lane Riggs : Well, and this is Lane, and Theresa, to your point, I mean the extreme measures our industry took to deal with the pandemic demand destruction, it's hard to imagine outside of another pandemic the demand destruction where going though a recession would have anything remotely close to that. And obviously, going through the pandemic, quite a bit of capacity was taken offline. Theresa Chen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So, guys, I guess kind of a follow-up on the mid-cycle question, but I'm going to ask it a little differently given your unique insights to this. Pembroke is clearly an insight to what's happening in Europe that, today, I guess is paying somewhere around $60.00 per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas, so U.K., obviously, is a little lower than that. But when you think about this structural cost advantage of the U.S., which is where we are focused, I guess, on mid-cycle, as opposed to global, what are the dynamics that you're seeing? Is Pembroke making money today? What's its relative competitiveness as a benchmark, let's say, for Europe versus the U.S.? Lane Riggs : Hey, Doug, it's Lane. So, a very good question, and we sort of talked about this quite a bit in terms of this advantage the United States is having with respect to, obviously, energy prices. Today, Pembroke is doing well; it did particularly well in this past quarter. To give a more of a precise answer around natural gas, you've been mainly paying about $30 to, I don't know, maybe -- to this morning, it was $50, but I mean, per million BTU, but I would say it's more in this $30 range. There's quite a bit of volatility, however the U.K. is a little bit better-positioned than Europe is in terms of the value that they're paying for gas. So, even [there is another step] [Ph] change, and we're not -- we don't refine over there, so we're just sort of reading the same things that you guys are, there's another step change in terms of how much gas is costing in the U.K. versus some of these European refineries that are maybe not in the best situation around natural gas. So, Pembroke is doing well, I mean and -- and so, I wouldn't consider it actually to be at the marginal capacity today. Obviously, the fact that they're doing well means that we're way past them as being somebody like -- even them being the sort of marginal capacity setting out their -- setting the -- mainly the heat crack, so -- Doug Leggate : Lane, if I may follow-up real quick, where does Pembroke sit in, to the extent you're prepared to share, on your portfolio cost curve today? Lane Riggs : Well, today, it's high, right, because of the cost of natural gas. But when you look at them on the other issues, whether it's our -- sort of our -- our cost per barrel or all those out, sort of on an energy-adjusted basis, they're one of the most competitive refineries in Europe, and actually look pretty good on a U.S. basis. And so, I'm not going to give exact precision, but it's a very efficient refinery. They have are very, very competitive in the Atlantic Basin. Doug Leggate : Okay, thank you. My follow-up, so hopefully a quick one, you've cut your net debt in half over the past year, I guess. I for one, as you know, am delighted to see some cash building on the balance sheet. I'm just curious how you think about bulletproofing your balance sheet versus stepping into, perhaps, your buybacks over the foreseeable future? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Jason Fraser : Thanks, Doug, this is Jason, I can take one. We'll be doing basically the same thing we've been doing in the past. Our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. We said when the margins start recovering, we start paying down our debt and build cash as a priority; we made really good progress on both of those fronts. And Joe and Homer mentioned on the debt side, and you mentioned, we had a series of transactions, starting last September running through June 1, where we paid back $2.3 billion of our COVID debts so far. On the cash side, we said we'd planned a whole more given what we experienced through COVID, $3 billion to $4 billion be the range we'd look at. We're now at $5.4 billion with a net debt to cap of 25% at the end of the second quarter. So, we think we're in a good shape on those fronts. Now, our approach to buybacks will continue to be guided by our target payout ration of 40% to 50%, just the net cash from operations. We've remained at the lower-end of the range so far this year given our competing priorities of paying back the debt and building cash. We're at a 42% payout so far this year, so we think we're in good shape, and we'll plan to continue doing more of the same, paying down our debt and honoring our return commitment to the shareholders. Doug Leggate : All right, guys, I appreciate the answers. Thank you. Joe Gorder : You bet, Doug. Take care. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read : Yes, thank you, good morning. Joe Gorder : Morning, Roger. Roger Read : Coming back to the demand thing, but maybe a little more of a forward look, distillate was the big surprise kind of in the spring coming out of the winter in Europe. And as we look to this next winter, I mean if you're in Europe it doesn't look like gas gets any cheaper. So, as we think about distillate or fuel oil demand there and the way we're running at this point, in the summer, what do you see as the ways in which incremental diesel can make it into Europe and affect the overall Atlantic Basis margins? Lane Riggs : Yes, it's going to be a real challenge for us, Roger, to be able to supply a lot more diesel into Europe. If you look, with the U.S. inventories where they are, the industry basically running all-out. We're getting back to where jet demand is recovering in the U.S., which is actually driving ULSD yields down a little bit. So, it's very difficult for me seeing that there's going to be a lot of flow from the U.S. into Europe. Roger Read : Got you. And then as a follow-up on the 40% to 50% payout ratio, pre-COVID there were a number of times you ran well above that level. Now that we're in a situation where it looks like better than mid-cycle, cracks are going to persist for a while, you want to hold more cash. Do you see this as a situation where you may undershoot or kind of consistently stay at the low-end, as we saw in the second quarter or is this something that evolves as, let's just say, as $4 billion of debt repayment is achieved is -- does it go back into that -- or to the high-end of the range thereafter? Joe Gorder : You want to answer the first one? Jason Fraser : Yes, sure. Yes, you're right, for the foreseeable future, at least in the next several months, we've still got that competing priority of paying down our debt. So, I think we'll stay at the lower end while we're paying down debt. If any of the cycle continues to be super strong, you're right; we'll have a lot of excess cash to consider. Lane Riggs : Yes, and Roger, I agree completely with what Jason said. I mean we want to go ahead and get things cleaned up, and get this balance sheet absolutely bulletproofed. And carrying a bit more cash is something that makes a lot of sense to do. You'd like to have your maintenance and turnaround CapEx covered with cash on hand, the dividend covered with cash on hand, and then we'll see where we go. But, anyway, I think for now we're on the right course, and as Gary has stated, it looks like the margin environment is going to be higher for some time. It certainly is today, not what we experienced in the second quarter but certainly well above what we would consider to be a traditional mid-cycle. And if we continue to build cash we'll continue to honor the payout, and it'll probably move from the lower end to the higher end. Roger Read : Okay. And just maybe as one little tweak on that, as you think about dividend versus share repos, does that ultimately change once the balance sheet is back the way you wanted -- it's been a while since you've increased the dividend, I guess, is really what I'm getting at. Should we think of that as becoming another way to return cash? Lane Riggs : Yes, I mean, you should. That is something we'll be looking at, as we've discussed, our short-term focus is on getting the debt back down. And we will look at that. We met and looked at this before. We'll be measured in our approach to ensure it's something that's sustainable through this cycle, especially given what we experienced coming through COVID, but that is something we'll be looking at. Roger Read : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Paul Sankey of Sankey Research. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey : Hi, good morning, everyone. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Paul. Paul Sankey : Good morning. It was obviously a momentous quarter for oil markets. Can you just talk a bit about what's happened in crude markets, and what the outlook is in terms of, obviously, the Russian impacts and the various differentials we're looking at, the Brent/WTI Spread, everything else? Thanks. Gary Simmons : Yes, this is Gary. So, I think, overall, we started to see there was not certainty what would happen with the Russian sanctions, but as time has gone on it appears that the Russian oil has continued to flow, and it's a change in trade flow, not less Russian oil on the market. The combination of that, SPR barrels coming on to the market, some production growth in certain parts of the world caused flat price to come down. And then it's also caused quality differentials to be pressured somewhat. In addition to the things I mentioned, the early releases, the SPR, largely medium-sour barrels with pressured the differentials. And then we've seen high sulfur fuel oil move weaker, which high sulfur fuel oil prices tend to impact quality differentials as well. Some of that is Russian [resid] [Ph], is starting to make its way back to the market. You're seeing more high sulfur fuel oil come from Mexico, and so those things are starting to pressure the quality differentials we're seeing in the market today. Paul Sankey : That's very helpful, thanks. Could you just continue that forward thought, how do you think things will change over the next six months or so? I mean one obvious thing is that the SPR, I don't know, but I mean presumably at some point it's got to stop being released, right? Gary Simmons : Yes, well, that's exactly right. I think you'll see lower volumes coming from SPR. Most people have kind of lowered their global oil demand forecast. So, I think the oil markets are fairly well-balanced. We wouldn't expect a lot of movement in the quality differentials from where they are today. Paul Sankey : Thank you, appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Joe Gorder : Take care, Paul. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from John Royall of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. John Royall : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, on R&D, can you talk about the captures stepping down in 2Q, and any moving pieces there beyond the backwardation, I know you've talked about in the last quarter? And then, what do you expect the long-term captures to look like in that business once the -- you know, get to a more normal looking market structure for diesel and once you have DGD 3 up and running? Eric Herbort : Yes. This is Eric. I think you hit the nail on the head. Really the big difference between Q1 and Q2 was the severity of the backwardation quarter-to-quarter, but if you look at the rest of the capture rate, which was weaker, yes, soybean prices were higher, and obviously LCFS prices were down sort of averaging $130 in the first quarter versus closer to $100 in the second quarter. So, it's clearly margins tighter in the second quarter, and capture rate is lower mostly due to backwardation you mentioned. If you look forward, I think again you said that as USD markets normalize you will see a little bit of return normal in the back-half of this year for RD. John Royall : Great. And then, just picking with R&D, I know you've had some good news on the BTC and the staffs this morning. Could you give your latest thoughts on the LCFS program in California, and where you think pricing could go there? I know we have the scoping process now to think about, and we have a federal program in Canada starting next year. So, just any thoughts on pricing there into the second-half and next year will be helpful. Eric Herbort : Yes. The LCFS market in California has really seemed to have stabilized in the sort of $90 to $100 range. We don't see a lot of volume moving. And as you mentioned, the scoping meetings they have, they're considering increasing the obligations into 2030, which should have a -- create a greater demand for the LCFS credits. Because as we see now, with renewable diesel and other renewables consuming up to about 50% of the obligation, and gasoline demand still relatively muted on the West Coast is just -- it's the credit obligation. It's just not a big driver there. So, I think you mentioned Canada, we see that's an opening emerging market. The world is trying to figure what these earlier credit prices are going to be valued at, is that new federal regulation in Canada goes into effect between now and next June. And then obviously with Oregon and Washington opening up, they all seem to be hanging around the same sort of $90 to $100 credit price. So, obviously we want to see -- we would like to see that go back up, and if I was going to have an outlook, it seems to have stabilized some more kind of in that range. John Royall : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Connor Lynagh of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Connor Lynagh : Yes, thanks. I wanted to return to the topic of export markets and sort of the global balance. As we get closer to Europe's proposed date to stop taking Russian refined products, what's your sort of high-level view of how the market when we position, and the sort of implication I'm wondering about here is you highlight Latin America as a key area of your exports, is that likely to change, do you think Russian volumes will be competitive there, just high-level thoughts on that will be great. Joe Gorder : Yes, it's difficult to know what's going to happen with the sanctions. I think we see some South American countries that seem to be interested in taking some Russian barrels. So, that certainly could be a scenario that develops some of the Russian diesel makes its way to South America. And then we backfill into Europe, I could see that happening, but we don't really have a lot of clarity what's going to happen. Connor Lynagh : I guess then I'm just trying to triangulate, maybe this is more of a shorter term comment, but you were suggesting earlier that there probably was not a high likelihood that U.S. diesel in particular will be flowing to Europe, is that more of a near-term comment? And then if the sanctions were to enact, would you revisit that view or you just -- basically with the duration of that expectation? Joe Gorder : Yes, certainly in the short-term, freight rates are high, and we see a better incentive going into Latin America. I don't know what's going to happen in terms of Russian sanctions in the rebalancing. So, better we just kind of wait and see. Connor Lynagh : All right, fair enough. Maybe just to sneak one last one in here, capture rates have actually held up pretty strong in the refining business. Anything that we should think about in terms of big swing factors in the third quarter here? Do you think that 2Q result is pretty indicative of where you are going to be in the near-term? Lane Riggs : Hi, this is Lane. So, I would say, normally speaking absent any big moves in flat price, it would be fairly similar. Connor Lynagh : Appreciate it. I'll turn it back. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Yes, good morning, team. Congrats on a great quarter here. The first question was around the blender's tax credit. We got some news out of Wash last night that there could be an extension there. So, just would love your perspective on what that could mean for the DGD business? And how do you understand ruminations in Washington? Eric Herbort : Well, this is Eric, I'll start. The BTC obviously is part of the business model that we capture with renewable diesel obviously, and we have always said that we are fairly certain there would be some sort of a blender's tax credit, because there's always been one for them for the last decade. We have seen, you know, there's some view that without a blender's tax credit the [defo RIN] [Ph] would pick it up, and maybe not perfectly dollar-for-dollar, but certainly sort of the 70%-80% range. And so, we will see how this plays out. But certainly it's supportive of the renewable business. I don't know if Rich you wanted to comment at all on the political side. Richard Joe Walsh : Yes. This is Rich Walsh. I mean we just saw a bill came out late last night, 700 pages, we are looking through it. I mean there are some things in there that are helpful to our business, the tax credit obviously we're just talking about, there is also a SAF tax credit in there as well that we will be looking at, and there're some things too we are trying to sort through. So, I think this has surprised everybody that came out that quick, I don't think we really ever thought that the blender's tax credit was going to be -- tax credit would be a problem without -- end up on one of these bills before the end of the year. But it's always good to see it looking stronger and on the forefront. Neil Mehta : All right, great catching it. Follow-up is just on yield switching, we are in environment now, we are obviously heating oil and distillates trading well above gasoline, do you see the industry and the company being able to switch to capture that, and does that take some pressure off as the distillates, how the equation help to recapture inventory? Lane Riggs : Hey, Neil. This is Lane. So, Gary kind of addressed this a little bit, our assets have been in max distill mode for a few weeks. And so, one of the dynamics that's occurring right now, as Joe covered, it's actually made distillate yields fall, or diesel deals fall. So, I guess the short answer is I have seen everybody else is doing kind of similar signals, there's not a lot of additional diesel outside of incremental runs that somebody might have, and the industry is running at pretty high utilization rates. I don't see a big opportunity to make up through decent shortfall right now. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Lane. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Ryan Todd : Good, thanks. Maybe a follow-up on renewable diesel, and ways that spreads, and the feedstock market; obviously we have seen those spreads there [technical difficulty] first-half of the year, in particular, soybean oil moves pretty significantly in the recent time here. Can you talk a little about what you are seeing in animal fat, and kind of low feed markets in the second-half of the year, would you expect those to widen out little more, and then as you look towards the start up of DGD 3 would you expect kind of -- we saw late last year where as you start buying that there is some kind of normalization and equilibrium period there, where we see some volatility? Joe Gorder : Yes, I think as you said, I mean the soybean oil market was pricey in the second quarter, but since come down, and if you look at -- feedstock availability is there, I mean we are not having any problem sourcing any of the different waste oils or animal fat feedstocks. Relative values, it goes along. With the LCFS, you know, a lot of that is not as advantage as it has been if you look at sort of this time last year. But we certainly have availability to get the feedstocks we need for DGD 3, and there is no doubts with DGD 3 being our third and largest unit starting up in the fourth quarter it will change some of the trade flows certainly in the U.S. and as well as where we can pull from all the global sources of feedstocks. So, I think you are right, we will see any impact of feedstocks in general as we change a lot of the trade flows, and then -- but I think we will see in a collaboration some time next year as it sort of settles out. How those trade flows change. And so, it will be interesting and we are in it. That will be one thing we are looking at as you start up and see like I mentioned earlier the Canadian regulation opening up and some other markets opening up, we will be looking at how that all plays out versus feed stocks. Ryan Todd : Yes, and then maybe a quick question on project spend and the environment. I mean from your update it clearly doesn't see you are having an impact on timing. Any impact that the inflationary environment or supply chain I think it will have on capital budget, things like [indiscernible] project or DGD 3 as we look over the next 12 months? Lane Riggs : Hi, this is Lane; all those projects where steel prices and labor and everything else is locked in prior to sort of this inflationary time that we are experiencing right now. Ryan Todd : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Sam Margolin : Hello, how are you? Joe Gorder : Hey, Sam. Lane Riggs : Hey, Sam. Joe Gorder : Good. You? Sam Margolin : Good. Thanks. I want to ask about a comment I heard earlier on the call that made me think you mentioned high sulfur fuel spreads are blowing out. We've got Light Sweet premiums and WCS discounts are very deep. You have also got these very wide differentials between distillate and other products, specifically gasoline. It sounds like the scenario that people imagined for IMO 2020. And I was just wondering how influential do you think that is in the market today given everything else that's going on? Joe Gorder : I think you are seeing a lot of pull through of IMO 2020 in the market today. It's contributing to the stronger distillate cracks that you are seeing because more diesel has been pulled in the marine sector. And then it's also contributing to the higher sulfur fuel discounts as well. Lane Riggs : Hi, this is Lane. I'll add to that. It's also probably some of the really high valuations on sort of I am going to say sort of the landing basis weaker, because again it's a little bit -- it's not unlike what's happening on natural gas, the marginal refiner trying not to make high sulfur fuels bidding up the Light Sweet market, so they can try to stay out of that market, right? So, it's propping up that the value of that crude versus medium sours. Sam Margolin : Okay, thank you. And then, there is a follow-up for drilling down on renewable diesel conversation and maybe on the policy side. But some feedback that we've gotten recently from other industry contact is that renewable fuels including ethanol have moved very much into the energy security category. And almost that's taking prominence over the carbon and emission side. And then, that's spurring a lot of support -- incremental support I should say from regulators and DC. I was wondering if you are seeing the same thing when you interact with your counterparts in the government. Richard Joe Walsh : This is Rich. I'll take an opportunity there. I would just qualify by saying they are low carbon too. So, they are not moving just into security. They are also part of the low carbon solution. So, if you look at light carbon renewable diesel, it actually can outperform on a carbon intensity basis some of the EV alternatives that are out there. So, I think, one, what you are starting to see now is a realization among regulators that actually these low carbon liquid fuels are dropping. They are cheaper to implement. They are available for consumers. And they provide an opportunity to also solve some of the climate issues that are out there. So, I mean I think what you are seeing is recognizing in the marketplace that these might be better alternatives. And, of course, they are domestic and the real strength of the U.S. economy. So, it's not surprising that you are starting to see more affection for the low carbon fuels. Sam Margolin : All right. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Gabelman : Hi, taking my questions. I want to ask firstly on the policy side, and the government seemed interested in intervening in the markets when petroleum prices got too high, only a month ago, and there is obviously concerns into the back-half of the year that prices can rise again particularly on the flat [crude toys] [Ph]. So, I was wondering if you could maybe discuss a bit higher conversations with the government when particularly around petroleum products export banner quota and if you think that's a realistic policy option that the government could implement in the future, and how that would impact you? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Joe Gorder : Okay. So, Lane and I had the opportunity to meet with the Secretary of Energy and members of her team in response to President Biden's request, and I would consider the meeting to be constructive. She was well-briefed on what the issues were, and the implications of some of the policy changes that you just mentioned. We talked about various options that could be implemented in the short-term, it would help take some of the pressure off of fuel prices that have those in hand, and in fact the staff -- her staff has continued to follow-up with members of our team and other attendees in that meeting to see what might make sense to try to implement. So, it was a good meeting. Lane, anything you would add to that? Lane Riggs : The only thing I would add, I don't remember any mention of trying to limit exports -- Joe Gorder : No, no. Lane Riggs : I will really not talk about whatsoever. Joe Gorder : And yes, it goes to my point that they understand the implications of some of these decisions. You know, banning exports doesn't have the effect that they would want to have as far as we can tell. It would probably just put some pressure on the industry, and it would certainly drive the global prices higher without the U.S. supply to backfill some of the shortfalls that are out there. So, they seem to have a keen grasp for that. And that was encouraging to us, but I consider it was a constructed meeting, and they're interested in solutions. It's always interesting to see what happens after these conversations take place, and would there be any actual follow-up with it, but there is still talking. So, more to come, Jason. Jason Gabelman : All right. Were there any potential solutions that you and the representatives you met with eye on? Joe Gorder : Yes. I think one of the things was RVP change. Lane Riggs : RVP in relaxing self-respect, that was essentially I think the major -- ongoing policy there's essentially an initiative that you could give, it would help maybe -- some of the U.S. refiners have to export because of self-respect. That's fairly clear. And so, I think that -- and then the other idea was again like what Joe just mentioned, relaxing the RVP in some of these, and that would require some of the non-attainment metropolitan areas would have to go from reformulated to a conventional land. That's a little bigger move, but those are the things that we talked about. Jason Gabelman : Got it. That's really helpful. And my follow-up just on DGD, we are getting to this cash flow inflexion point in the business when DGD 3 starts up, and I was wondering if you could help us think about guideposts for what cash distribution policy will be from the joint venture back to the partners, or at least a time when we could expect an update on that? Thanks. Jason Fraser : Okay. This is Jason. I will start off, and then maybe Eric can chime in. We all know how DGD was -- the business was build, we use cash flows from the business, it's funded, all the growth are largely funded till now. We will DGD 3 coming online in the fourth quarter. So, there should be some tests, cash flows to look out at the time and the partners will be [indiscernible] what to do with it. Eric Herbort : Yes. So, obviously we do expect there to be a positive cash flow next year with the DGD 3 starting up, and capital finishing on that project. And so, obviously we will have to work with our partner on what we want to do with that cash. And so, like we have said, we're going to take a pause after DGD 3 starts up, and we kind of take that a look on the market of -- you know, lot of things we have talked about today between feedstocks and new product elements, and then we hook with the recent policy discussions that came out last night, you know, what we want to do with the cash, but obviously there should be a cash flow to discuss in 2023 associated with DGD. Jason Gabelman : All right, thanks a lot for the answers. Joe Gorder : Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning. If this potential DPC for SAF goes through, would you think about adding SAF capability at DGD 3, and if so, what kind of yields should we be thinking about? Lane Riggs : Yes, so, obviously, there's a lot of things we got to still get the details of before -- but we certainly have a project in the wings that is waiting to see how this SAF credit is going to play out. And so, there is a project that we looked at for -- that we continue to do engineering on that would bolt-on SAF capability to DGD 3 with roughly a kind of 50-50 yield of SAF and renewable diesel. So, it would be a significant increase in SAF capability for the U.S., obviously the largest producer of SAF. So, it does like you it could be a possibility, but like I said, a lot of details to work through from a policy standpoint, and then as well that has to be discussed with our partner. Matthew Blair : Sounds good. And then, could you walk us through the Q2 hedging impacts at DGD? I think in Q1 it was a headwind of $119 million. What does that look like for Q2? And this, like an inventory hedge or a margin hedge, any details there? Lane Riggs : Yes, that's -- all those details will be in the Q. And what I would say is really, it's all just a product of backwardation being more severe in the second quarter than the first quarter. So, it was a larger impact and that's why, as we said earlier, margin capture was much lower mostly just because of the market effects on ULSD. But I think we see that probably looking a little more favorable in the back-half of the year. But if that's all, it'll really be tied to how the ULSD market plays out. But currently looks better, let's see how the rest of the year plays out. Matthew Blair : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. That brings us to the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Bhullar for close comment. Homer Bhullar : Great, thank you. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Obviously, feel free to contact the IR team if you have any additional questions. Thank you, everyone, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or logoff the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance. Thank you. Please go ahead. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report strong financial results for the third quarter, credited to our safe and reliable operational performance and continued strength in refining fundamentals. Refining margins remain supported by strong product demand, low product inventories and continued energy cost advantages for US refineries compared to global competitors. Despite high refinery utilization rates, global product supply remains constrained due to roughly four million barrels per day of global refining capacity being taken permanently off-line since 2020 for a variety of reasons, including unfavorable economics or as part of planned conversions to produce low carbon fuels. Product demand across our system remains strong, with gasoline and diesel demand higher than pre-pandemic levels, and jet fuel demand steadily approaching 2019 levels. Our refining utilization increased to 95% in the third quarter as we continue to maximize refining throughput. Our refining system also benefited from wider sour crude oil differentials to the Brent light sweet crude oil benchmark. The wider sour crude oil differentials are attributed to increased sour crude oil supply, the impact of the IMO 2020 regulation for lower sulfur marine fuels and high natural gas prices in Europe that incentivize European refiners to process sweet crude oils in lieu of sour crude oils. And we remain on track with our refining growth projects that reduce cost and improve margin capture. The Port Arthur Coker project, which is expected to increase the refinery's throughput capacity, while also improving turnaround efficiency, is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. In our renewable diesel segment, we continue to optimize our operations, setting another sales volume record in the third quarter. The new DGD 3 renewable diesel plant, located next to our Port Arthur refinery, is currently in the start-up process and is expected to be operational in November. The completion of this 470 million gallons per year plant is expected to increase DGD's total annual capacity to approximately 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. And for our other low-carbon fuel opportunities, the BlackRock and Navigators carbon sequestration pipeline project is progressing on schedule and is expected to begin start-up activities in late 2024. We're expecting to be the anchor shipper with eight of our ethanol plants connected to this system, which should provide a lower carbon intensity ethanol product and generate higher product margins. And we continue to evaluate other low-carbon opportunities such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable hydrogen and additional renewable naphtha and carbon sequestration projects. On the financial side, our strong balance sheet remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation framework. In the third quarter, we reduced our debt by an additional $1.25 billion, bringing our total debt reduction to approximately $3.6 billion since incurring $4 billion of incremental debt during the height of the pandemic in 2020. And we will continue to further evaluate deleveraging opportunities going forward. Looking ahead, refining fundamentals remain strong as global product supply remains constrained due to capacity reductions and high natural gas prices in Europe, which are setting a higher floor on margins. In addition, we continue to realize the benefit from discounted sour crude oil and fuel oil feedstocks in our system. While geopolitical and macroeconomic factors may drive volatility in the market, we remain focused on what we can control, maximizing refinery utilization in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner to provide essential products. We also remain committed to advancing the growth of our low carbon fuels businesses to increase profitability and further strengthen our competitive advantage. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the third quarter of 2022, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.8 billion or $7.19 per share, compared to $463 million or $1.13 per share for the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.8 billion or $7.14 per share for the third quarter of 2022, compared to $545 million or $1.33 per share for the third quarter of 2021. For reconciliations to adjusted amounts, please refer to the earnings release and the accompanying financial tables. The refining segment reported $3.8 billion of operating income for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $835 million for the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of 2021 was $911 million. Refining throughput volumes in the third quarter of 2022 averaged 3 million barrels per day, which was 141,000 barrels per day higher than the third quarter of 2021. Throughput capacity utilization was 95% in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 91% in the third quarter of 2021. Refining cash operating expenses of $5.48 per barrel in the third quarter of 2022 were $0.95 per barrel higher than the third quarter of 2021, primarily attributed to higher natural gas prices. Renewable diesel segment operating income was $212 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared to $108 million for the third quarter of 2021. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 2.2 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2022, which was 1.6 million gallons per day higher than the third quarter of 2021. The higher sales volumes were due to DGD 1 downtime in the third quarter of 2021, resulting from Hurricane Ida, and the impact of additional volumes from DGD 2, which started up in the fourth quarter of 2021. The ethanol segment reported $1 million of operating income for the third quarter of 2022, compared to a $44 million operating loss for the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of 2021 was $4 million. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.5 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2022. For the third quarter of 2022, G&A expenses were $214 million and net interest expense was $138 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $632 million and income tax expense was $816 million for the third quarter of 2022. The effective tax rate was 22%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2 billion in the third quarter of 2022. Excluding the unfavorable change in working capital of $1.5 billion, which was primarily due to our third quarter estimated tax payment and the other joint venture member share of DGD's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $3.4 billion. With regard to investing activities, we made $602 million of capital investments in the third quarter of 2022, of which $185 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and $417 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture members share of DGD and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $479 million in the third quarter of 2022. Moving to financing activities. Year-to-date, we have returned 40% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders through dividends and stock buybacks, which is consistent with our guidance to be at the low end of our annual 40% to 50% target payout ratio, while focusing on deleveraging our balance sheet. With respect to our balance sheet, we completed another debt reduction transaction in the third quarter that reduced Valero's debt by $1.25 billion. As Joe noted earlier, this transaction, combined with a series of debt reduction and refinancing transactions since the second half of 2021, have collectively reduced Valero's debt by approximately $3.6 billion. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of total debt, $1.9 billion of finance lease obligations and $4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents, was approximately 24%, down from the pandemic high of 40% at the end of March 2021, which was largely the result of the debt incurred during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we ended the quarter well capitalized with $4.9 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2022 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of that amount is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. About half of the growth capital in 2022 is allocated to expanding our low carbon fuels businesses. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.73 million to 1.78 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 460,000 to 480,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 250,000 to 270,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $5.10 per barrel. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 750 million gallons in 2022 with the anticipated start-up of DGD 3 in November. Operating expenses in 2022 should be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.1 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0. 05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the fourth quarter, net interest expense should be about $140 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $640 million. For 2022, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $870 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, please adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Please respect this request to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Joe, I wonder if I could take the opportunity to ask just your views on a couple of big picture macro issues. I mean, in the quarter, your operational performance speaks for itself. I'm obviously delighted to see the cash returns back with the buyback. But my question, I guess, is your visit to the White House recently and your thoughts on the possibility of an export ban, product export ban that seems to be still rumbling on the table. So any color you are comfortable sharing there would be my first comment. And then my second question, if I may, maybe it's for Lane or one of the guys. But you did make a comment in your results about a higher floor on margins. I'm just wondering, I think you know our view on this, I'm wondering if you could elaborate on what you're trying to imply from that commentary? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. Joe Gorder : No, Doug, that's great. Both good questions. So on the visit to the White House, Lane and I went in and of course, there were seven companies, I think, represented there. We ended up meeting with Secretary Granholm. And I would say that it was a constructive conversation. She was looking for things that the industry might suggest that would try to bring down the cost of fuels. And so we did, we provided her with several suggestions, which would have an effect on increasing the supply of fuel into the marketplace. Thus far, I don't believe any of those have been embraced, but at least it was put on the table for her to give it some consideration to. And so the team that we have involved in the process continues to work with her team. So the dialogue has continued. I know that our DC office has spent quite a bit of time continuing to work with them. And then, of course, the supply folks back here also have been involved in those conversations. So the dialogue continues, and I think they're looking for just additional opportunities that they might have to reduce the fuel price. So Rich, is there anything you would add to that, you or Lane? Rich Walsh : No, I don't think so. I mean, I think they understand the consequences of trying to disrupt market flows. And I think they realized that would probably be more harmful than helpful. And so I think that understanding is there. So I know they're looking at a lot of options, but I think that's the understanding they have from the industry at least. Joe Gorder : Yeah. So that's as it relates to the potential ban on exports, Doug. I mean, I do think they understand the consequences of that. And I think the general consensus is, it wouldn't have the effect that they're trying to achieve. And then you want to take the second question? Lane Riggs : Yeah, sure. Doug, it's Lane. From a work process, we define the mid-cycle as being the average margin of a few tweaks that we think are market anomalies that go through the entire business cycle. So we're not through the next business cycle yet, but we do believe structurally, you've had interperiod where we've had refinery closures through the pandemic. You're going to have probably not as much investment in the fossil fuel industry, in particular, refining going forward at the time when everybody is trying to understand exactly how the balances are going to work. But our view is will be a higher call on refining capacity. So we don't -- we're not prepared to quantify that, but we do believe the next mid-cycle will be higher than the last mid-cycle. Doug Leggate : Guys, forgive me for the quick follow-up, but there's a lot of concern, I guess, of Chinese exports hitting the market, and obviously new capacity expansion, Lane. So I just wonder if you could throw that into your consideration. Is that a concern for you guys in that definition of mid-cycle? And I will leave it there. Thank you. Lane Riggs : There has been a talk about -- we've seen some increases with respect to -- at least, on the prompt that the Chinese are picking up purchases, but I don't know that we've really seen them in the market on products that much. I'm looking at Gary, by the way. Gary Simmons : No. I think our traders believe most of the Chinese exports are going to stay in the region. And then, even if you kind of assume some of it comes into the North Atlantic Basin, in the short term, the French refinery strikes are really offsetting any of that. And longer term, it looks like, to us, any incremental volume coming out of China will be offset by further reductions in exports from Russia as the sanctions are ramped up. Lane Riggs : And then on a longer-term basis, just whether Europeans and North America and everyone else is sort of under ESG pressure aren't really trying to increase refining capacity. So if there is a region of the world that's going to raise refining capacity, that will probably be India and China. Doug Leggate : Thank you, guys. Appreciate the answers. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from John Royall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Royall : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So you talked about bulletproofing your balance sheet in the prior quarter, and you mentioned evaluating further reductions in your prepared remarks. How much lower would you like to get on your leverage before you kind of get to that bulletproof level where you can move off the low end of the 40% to 50% returns, or do you think you're already there? Joe Gorder : John, that's a good question. We'll let Jason take a swack at it here. Jason Fraser : Yes, yes. As we've been talking about, we're still working on paying down our COVID debt. We have about $432 million left to have paid off the full $4 billion after accounting for the tender offer we did in this third quarter. So we're working our debt down with -- and let's see on the cash side, we're at a $4 billion cash balance, we talked about how, going forward, we like to hold more cash at $3 billion to $4 billion probably on the base level. But if you're looking at potentially higher flat price levels or economic downturn, you maybe want to hold a little bit more. So we bias to the upper end of that. So we're close to a good spot on both of those. On a long-term debt to cap -- net debt to cap, we have a 20% to 30% range that we target. We're at 24.5% now at the end of the third quarter, down from 40% at the highest point toward COVID. So we've been working in the right direction. I'd like to be even lower, you'd like to be at the 20% range to give you more financial flexibility going forward. So that's kind of an overview. Joe Gorder : So we're getting close. Jason Fraser : Yes. Joe Gorder : To the point where, I mean, the low end of the range wouldn't necessarily be the target anymore. John Royall : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe you could talk about refining captures and how they're looking so far in 4Q. I know we have, at least in October, a rising price environment, but also you're seeing some tailwinds from heavy dips. So any color there just generally would be helpful. Lane Riggs : This is Lane. The heavy dips are baked into our margin indicators to some degree. So those will move with it. I think, and all things being equal, when you compare the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and this is really in any given year, you'll see a blending of butane benefit. So if you hold all the other things constant, our capture rates are a bit marginally improved because of -- we're going to be on more butane in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter. And, obviously, if flat price moves up or down, byproducts have enough to effect. So those are all still intact. But your biggest contribution to margin capture really is gasoline and diesel. So we'll just see. But the main thing to always keep in mind going from third quarter to fourth quarter is blending and butane. John Royall : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Please, go ahead. Theresa Chen : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about your comments related to demand across your footprint first. Your wholesale volumes being very strong through last quarter, and currently, when you talk about demand surpassing 2019 levels for gasoline and diesel, is that primarily driven by strengthening your export channels? Is domestic demand in your areas of service equally strong? I'd like to get a sense of what's happening there. Gary Simmons : Hi, Theresa, this is Gary. Really, it's the domestic markets and our wholesale volumes have trended considerably higher. We set a wholesale volume record in August. We beat that in September, and we're on pace to beat it again in October. So wholesale volumes continue to trend higher. If you look at the pump market through our wholesale channels of trade, gasoline is trending about 8% above where we were pre-pandemic levels. Diesel volumes are trending about 32% above where we were pre-pandemic levels. So seeing really strong domestic demand through our wholesale channels of trade. Theresa Chen : Got it. Thank you. And in relation to the high European natural gas prices supporting higher margins. Given the recent decline in TTF and our natural gas storage over 93% full, lowering that Henry Hub to TTF spread. Do you see any risk for a pullback of margins as a result over the near term, while longer term, I imagine just depends on the pace of liquefaction build-out. Lane Riggs : But I'll try, I'll take a shot at it, and I've seen Gary, again, in sort of my comments. We still need to reinventory the Atlantic Basin with diesel. By and large, we're still -- when you look at stocks, they're slow. Most of what's happening in Europe when you have all these LNG ships that are sort of floating down, you still are limited on the regasification of everything. So we'll just have to see how it plays out. But certainly in the last couple of weeks, at least for our Pembroke refinery, natural gas prices have fallen. Theresa Chen : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Please, go ahead. Sam Margolin : Good morning, everybody. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Sam. Sam Margolin : So we definitely see evidence, everybody does, of this structurally higher margin environment. But more than just kind of through cycle margins being higher, the market is also sort of characterized by anomalies like a very high frequency of sort of regional blowouts or single commodity events within the stream. And I was wondering if you could just maybe speak broadly to that, not to ask too open ended of a question, but just is that -- are things like this a function of kind of capacity coming down globally, or just a very tight market on an underlying basis, or is it is really just a coincidence where we've had kind of a bunch of one-off things happen in sequence and that might not necessarily be a go-forward trend? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think some of it is structural. I think, as Joe alluded to in his opening, we had a lot of refinery rationalization, refining capacity converted to produce low carbon fuels. And so, much tighter supply-demand balances, which structurally means a stronger market. Some of the things you talked about on market dislocation could be more transient in nature. A lot of that is just a function of very, very low product inventories, especially in the domestic markets. I think we feel like through the winter period of time, you could see some restocking of gasoline, which could prevent some of those market dislocations from happening, at least in the short term. Diesel, on the other hand, looks to us to be -- remain very, very tight, and I think you'll continue to see volatility in the markets due to very low inventory. Sam Margolin : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up on DGD and the start up timing. You know, in the past, when you guys start up a DGD unit, we can see feedstock prices or the veg oil complex, sort of, respond. And this year, I don't know if it's a timing issue where it hasn't really started yet in earnest or if the market has just adjusted to that demand ahead of time. But it seems like the feedstock environment has tolerated new starting capacity a little bit better than in the past, if you have any thoughts about just DGD 3 into the feedstock background that would be helpful? Eric Fisher : Yes, this is Eric. I think, what your observations are correct. We are not seeing the increase in feedstock prices like we did with DGD 2 this time last year. Thinking about some cases of that, I think some of it is given refining margins, the conversion projects that had been announced, I think, have largely been deferred or delayed. And with the drop in LCFS prices, I think a lot of the projects have been deferred and delayed. So if you look, we just not -- we have not seen the increase in feedstock prices like we did last year with DGD 3 starting up. And we have bought feedstock for the start-up in this quarter. Sam Margolin : Okay. Thank you so much. Have a great day. Eric Fisher : Sam. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe one follow-up immediately on Diamond Green Diesel. You've been in a pretty rapid expansion mode at DGD over the last couple of years. With the start-up of DGD 3, will you take a pause here to, kind of, digest and evaluate for market conditions for a bit, or how do you think about the strategic direction of Diamond Green Diesel unit over the next five years in terms of priorities there? Lane Riggs : Yes. I think, like we've talked about this quarter and last quarter, LCFS prices continue to drop. And I think that is taking a lot of the fun away in this space. And so as you look across the industry, a lot of projects are getting deferred and delayed. And given the high energy prices across the world, everyone is kind of rethinking a lot of their policies. So we have to, especially, in Europe you have to step back and see, are they going to continue the path and pace that they have been on historically? So I think after DGD 3, we've said, we will pause, reassess the market. I think SAF is becoming a lot more interesting. But overall, I think there will be a pause after DGD 3. Ryan Todd : Yeah. Thanks. And then maybe you mentioned it briefly in passing earlier, and I know it's a little speculative, but any thoughts on how you think trade routes and supply chains get impacted if you expand on Russian product imports goes into effect early next year? Is there a logical home for some of that Russian product to make its way to someplace else, South America or Africa, et cetera, or do you think those Russian barrels just kind of go away and refining utilization falls dramatically there? Lane Riggs : Our view is that you will see a reduction in Russian exports of primarily diesel. They export a little bit of naphtha, not much gasoline. But on the diesel side, you will see a reduction in exports. You do have the potential for some of those barrels to find homes in South America and Africa, as you mentioned. But we, kind of, believe diplomatic pressures from the US and from Europe will, kind of, keep a lot of that from happening, and you will see a reduction in exports from Russia. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Paul Sankey of Sankey Research. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey : Hi, guys. Can you hear me okay? Joe Gorder : Morning Paul. Paul Sankey : Can you hear me, Joe? Joe Gorder : Yes, sir, we can. Paul Sankey : Cool. Can you talk a little bit about the strategic petroleum reserve release? Joe, you mentioned a few things that made SPR crude discounts wider, but my understanding was a lot of the drawdown in the SPR was crude. I was just wondering how much the SPR has affected you, I guess, operationally and from a profit point of view and what your outlook is for the coming months. I would assume that you're anticipating that we taper and even start reducing the crude. Thanks. Lane Riggs : Yes. So really, what we saw is with each of the SPR options, we have good logistics at our Gulf Coast assets to be able to receive the barrels. A lot of people really don't have the logistics in place to be able to take those barrels. So, certainly, early on, they were more sour barrels, and we took a good volume of the SPR volume as it transition to more sweeter. We still saw value in our system to take those barrels and we would expect that to continue moving forward as long as they're offering the barrels. Paul Sankey : I know you're anticipating continuing drawdowns through, let's say, 2023, or do you think they will have to start convention? Lane Riggs : I think you'll continue to see drawdowns at least through this year and then start to see some restocking happen next year. Paul Sankey : Great. Thanks a lot. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Thanks Paul. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Connor Lynagh of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Connor Lynagh : Yes, thanks. I wanted to return to a topic that you mentioned briefly earlier, which is the suggestion that you made to the administration on potential pathways for reducing fuel costs. I'm curious if you could just provide a little color on the things that the industry suggested. Joe Gorder : Well, Lane and I were both there. So, do you want to talk about it first? Lane Riggs : Sure. I think -- yes, this is Lane. So I think the -- there's two main ones, which was one was increasing or relaxing the sulfur spec on fuels. Many of the US refiners didn't necessarily invest, and it looks like either making ultra-low sulfur diesel as much as maybe some others or Tier 3 gasoline. So, consequently, they're in a posture of having to export some of those -- some gasoline and some diesel to markets around the world that can handle the sulfur. So, that was really, I think, the two big ones. I mean, obviously, a part of that meeting was meant to see if there was any possibility if somebody could start a refinery up and we discuss -- the industry discuss the difficulty in doing that and that was really the main coming ones. Joe Gorder : I mean, yes, waving specs really on products was what we talked about. The one interesting thing, Connor, that came out of it, too, was there was consideration for the ability to restart refining capacity that had been shut down. And I think the general sentiment was that, that wasn't going to happen. Of course, we're not in that boat. But I mean, people had very good reasons for making the decisions that they made, and they weren't in a position to unwind those decisions. So, the solution is going to probably have to come from some waving of regulation or just reduction in demand, which we just haven't seen to-date. Connor Lynagh : Makes sense. Semi-related policy question, just given that the Inflation Reduction Act is maybe had a bit of time to be digested by the market or players out there that you talk to. What types of opportunities are you seeing as more likely or more in the money with the incentives in that bill? Rich Walsh : This is Rich Walsh. I'll take just a high-level effort on it and then, kind of, give you an idea. I mean, we're really -- we're focusing on a number of things. One is that they have clean energy tax credits in there that are enacted, that are really an extension of the BTC, the Blender's Tax Credit, which is helpful to us. There's also tax credits there for sustainable aviation fuel. And I think Eric had mentioned earlier, that makes it more interesting for us to look at. And, additionally, there's additions for the 45Q tax credit, which we think strongly supports carbon sequestration, and we think you're going to see more opportunities to develop around that. Connor Lynagh : Okay. Got it. I\u2019ll turn it back here. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Please, go ahead. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Hi, Paul. Paul Cheng : Two questions, hopefully, short. First one is for Lane. I think, back in the first quarter conference call, you gave a number of $8 in the diesel crack advantage for US refiner versus Europe, because of the natural gas price gap. And at the time, you're using, say, you need is $25 gap. Since then, we have seen the European refiner essentially cut their natural gas consumption by half. So curious that, is there an updated number you can share? And is it -- we need that cut from $8 to $4 just linear or that we can't really do in that way? Secondly, that -- and also that, if you can give us what is your natural gas exposure by operating region for you guys? The second question is on DGD. I think that the joint venture so forward on the diesel contract as a part of the hedge operation. So in a backwardation curve you had heard -- in the third quarter, I think the backwardation curve is substantially less than second quarter. So we were surprised your margin capture didn't improve comparing you to your benchmark indicator. Is there anything going on we should be aware that lead to that or anything -- any insight you can provide? Thank you. Lane Riggs : Hey, Paul. So, that was -- yes, I'll try to come back to that first question a little bit. But you're accurate in what I had stated in the first quarter. Today, what we're seeing, at least in our Pembroke refineries, natural gas prices have fallen. But I think what you're seeing in the Atlantic Basin, you're seeing in the diesel crack, is the advantage is lower, but you still have a wide diesel crack. And that's because a lot of the refineries that are having, that sort of reinventory the Atlantic Basin, are looking to running a lot of sweeter crudes, because they can't meet the fuel oil spec, right? So they end up bidding up in the industry, or at least the marginal guy out there is bidding up the sort of the low sulfur crude price to try to meet the demand in the Atlantic Basin. So -- and you're seeing that in discount, you're seeing medium sour getting cheaper, you're seeing heavy sour getting cheaper. Part of that is also a function of redirection of all the Russian trade flow. So that's really in terms of a prompt basis, what's driving the heat crack. I don't know that Europe solved this natural gas problem. We're just going to see. There's a lot of tankers sitting offshore trying to regas. And so we'll just see how that goes. Eric, do you want to... Paul Cheng : Lane, before you go on that one. I'm just curious that, I mean, is the advantage US refiner versus Europe on the natural gas price gap, does it impact that advantage when the European refiner cut their natural gas consumption, or that doesn't really -- that's not how it should be calculated or be in? Joe Gorder : What I'm saying is versus the fourth quarter first quarter really up until about three weeks ago, there was an advantage that you could see they were paying higher cost of fuel. We could also see, when we use our Pembroke Refinery as a proxy, we were through that, right? In other words, even though now we eliminated all of our natural gas purchases, but what we could see was the profitability or at least your ability to -- it was setting the marginal capacity out there in the Atlantic Basin. It's not so much around natural gas, I don't think today. I think what it is, is people are having to buy a very low sulfur crude oil to try to meet the low sulfur diesel spec and trying to avoid making a higher fuel oil spec. So in a simple term, some of it is being driven by IMO 2020 and the ability of some of these simple refiners can't deal with the crude oils that are available to them to restock the Atlantic Basin. Paul Cheng : I see. So you actually don't think that the natural gas is driving the advantage at all? Joe Gorder : Well, what I'm trying -- this is just a three-week phenomena, Paul. I'm not sure I would jump out there and try to make it an annualized thing. I'm just saying, I think most of the -- for the last quarter, a lot of is just being driven by the marginal economics of a simple refiner trying to buy -- having to buy low sulfur crudes to meet the Atlantic Basin diesel requirements. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. Joe Gorder : All right, Eric, you're ready? Eric Fisher : Yes. So on DGD, what you said is correct, that backwardation was less severe in the third quarter than the second quarter. So the margin capture issue in the third quarter was more related to the feedstock slate that we ran. And as before, where we said we haven't seen an increase in feedstock prices we did see, and this is a little bit of a function of the margin indicator. We saw \u2013 see by [ph] soybean prices drop $0.05 to $0.15 a pound below all of the waste oil feedstocks. And when you look at that through the third quarter, that was about 80% of the impact on the margin capture. So it's really related to what we're seeing is veg oils pricing at or below waste oil feedstocks. And so the only thing I would say going forward to be aware of, we are increasing the amount of veg oil that we are running in the DGD complex, not because waste oils are not available, just because we see flat prices of veg oils coming down to a point where the LCFS advantages are not as strong versus what we see in waste oils. So we are implementing veg oil into DGD because we see those prices are attractive. Paul Cheng : Eric, do you have a percentage? How much is the vegetable oil you're going to run in the DGD 3? Eric Fisher : Yes. We're not going to give out that level of detail. What I'll say is, up until the fourth quarter, we ran essentially zero veg oil. So we're incrementing veg oil into the units because of this attractive price. Paul Cheng : Okay. Eric, Thank you. Eric Fisher : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read : Hey. Hello, everybody. Good morning. Eric Fisher : Hi, Roger. Roger Read : Maybe just to come back to the cash returns to shareholders question. We're getting a lot of interest on not just the 40% to 60% return, but how are you thinking about the split between those? And when should we think about potential to raise the dividend? Is it as simple as you get rid of the $4 billion that came with COVID? Or is there a step beyond that you want to see? And I think the question is growing more acute because as you look at the overall crack spread environment, right, it's one that says you're earning above a typical mid-cycle, so kind of an expectation, I think, here of greater than mid-cycle cash returns to shareholders is pushing on us. I'm just curious how you're thinking about it. Jason Fraser : This is Jason. I think, Joe answered it pretty well. I'll ran through our cash. We were up to $4 billion now, which is getting to where we'd like to be. The debt is getting to a good level at 24.5%. We still like to do a little bit more. We have 430 left just to have paid-off the COVID and prefer to be at the lower end of that 20% to 30% range. But, yes, we're getting in a good shape, but I would say we're not declaring victory yet. Joe Gorder : Roger, it's -- and Jason answered correctly. We don't know the economic climate is going to be like going into next year. It's probably premature to certainly to make a commitment right now on anything that we're going to use the balance sheet to defend. And I think everyone clearly could see that we had stated in the past that we were going to defend the dividend with the balance sheet, and we did that. And we will do that in the future. And so we just want to be sure that we don't need your care and then we've got a line of sight that we get a position where we want to be positioned. And then we have line of sight to the way things look going into next year before we would make that decision. But I do think we've got the flywheel of the buybacks, and we talked about maybe not moving up above. And by the way, it's 40% to 50%, okay? You took us up to 60%. I didn't notice that, okay? But it's 40% to 50%. And we'll see. We'll use that flywheel to drive the returns. Roger Read : Hey, got to try something here and there, and you know that's right. All right, well, let me try something else more on the kind of the operational side. You brought it up as there is obviously a risk of a slowing economic cycle out there. What level would you think about a typical recession impact in terms of fuel demand, recognizing gasoline is already well below what we would call, kind of, a normal environment. So let's maybe think about diesel since that's the real strong part. When you think about industrial demand weakness, transportation-related weakness, right, whether it's just typical trucking, et cetera, how does that factor in? Like what, kind of, would you expect to see a couple of hundred thousand barrels go away? Is it a 10% sort of, cut top to bottom? I'm just wondering how you think about the typical magnitude impact of a recession on fuel demand. Gary Simmons : Hey, Roger, this is Gary. I guess as the guys have, kind of, gone back and looked at recessionary period in the past, they see their product demand has hit about two times GDP. So whatever GDP assumption you're going to have, you would take twice that on the impact of fuel demand. And as you mentioned, more of that is going to be diesel, less on gasoline. I think there are some unique situations as we head into next year. One, jet demand hasn't fully recovered. And so you'll have a good increase in jet demand as we would anticipate, and then Chinese oil demand has been down 20%. At some point in time, they will come out of the pandemic, and you would expect to see Chinese demand recover. So the combination of both those things is that we would expect, even with the typical recessionary period, you may see year-over-year global oil demand growth. Roger Read : All right. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Good morning team. First question is just around the high sulfur fuel oil market, and we're seeing these big heavy discounts showing up in the market. I love your perspective on, what do you think is driving it? How much of that really is the later impacts of IMO versus other dynamics in the market? And are you changing your configuration in refining at all to run some of that high sulfur fuel oil into the cokers? Are you doing it more through WCS and so forth? Gary Simmons : Yeah. So this is Gary. As Joe touched on a few of these things, but there's a number of factors that have been really driving the heavy sour discounts. First, the sanctions put on Russia have caused some rebalancing. A lot of the Indian and Chinese refiners are running euros. It's backed up Mars and heavy Canadian into the Gulf, which are driving those discounts wider, which we talked about the higher prices of natural gas around the world caused the operating expenses running heavy and medium sours to be higher. So that causes the discounts to be wider. There's a higher naphtha content in heavy Canadian crude. Naphtha has been discounted, so that drives the discounts wider. We've seen some unplanned maintenance in the US, which has also contributed. But overall, I think we continue to see weakness in high sulfur fuel oil, combined with higher refinery utilization, putting more product on the market. So some of that, what we expected in IMO 2020, we're finally starting to see in the market. The lack of Chinese demand is certainly also contributing to that. So for us, when we look at the market going forward, seasonal maintenance in Western Canada is coming to an end. You'll see higher diluent volumes as we head into winter. So all of that's putting more heavy Canadian on the market. We expect to see even more rebalancing occur as sanctions are ramped up in Russia. And so we expect this market to continue. We're certainly maximizing heavy Canadian in our system today and seeing a lot of opportunity to buy those high sulfur fuel in stocks, as you mentioned that we're putting to our cokers. Neil Mehta : Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. And the other question is you guys have really built a wonderful business here through organically. Really haven't done much M&A in the better part of the last decade. And just your perspective on whether, as you look forward, are there bolt-on M&A opportunities as we are seeing some A&D in the downstream markets and in low carbon markets, or do you want to continue to build the business on an organic basis? Joe Gorder : Neil, we're very comfortable with the approach we've taken to building the business. I mean, we went through the period, of course, where we grew the business. And frankly, bolted on a lot of stuff to the portfolio, which we now have largely operating to a level that we're comfortable with. And so we're very comfortable with the refining portfolio that we have in place today. We always look at opportunities that are out there, and we'll continue to do that. But the strategy that we've employed with really directing a significant part of the capital budget to the renewables businesses has made sense to us. We believe that they're very durable as is refining. But we're very comfortable with that approach, and we are comfortable with the way we've gone about doing it, which is certainly in the renewable diesel business from the ground up. So I think you should expect that we're not going to jump into the market for any kind of significant transaction. And we'll continue to do what we're doing. Neil Mehta : Makes tone of sense. Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Gabelman : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one kind of on near-term dynamics. Just thinking into 4Q, I was hoping you could discuss a couple of things. One, impacts to capture with the start-up of DGD 3, the ability to capture strong West Coast cracks in October, gasoline margins were over $100 a barrel. And then any impacts from the Mississippi River drought that you saw in your footprint that could be ongoing? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Gary Simmons : You want to start with DGD 3? Okay. On DGD 3, margin capture, I think, will be challenged. One of the details of this business is when you first start up a brand-new unit, we have to start up on temporary pathways that are somewhat generic to renewable diesel units. You got to run like that for the first several months until you gather the data to get your actual carbon intensity numbers. So margin capture on DGD 3 will be lower initially as we start up because you have to line out, get in, like I said, get the data to then cement your actual CI numbers. So I think that will be one of the main issues as we started DGD 3. So we'll certainly get volume, we'll certainly get more overall income. But if you look at it through the margin indicator or on a dollar per gallon basis on temporary CIs for the first several months, it will be lower. But that will line out in the back half of 2023 as we submit our data and get responses from all the different jurisdictions that you have to submit your CI numbers, too. Lane Riggs : This is Lane. On California, we have been executing a turnaround at our Benicia refinery, some of which the turnaround was in the third quarter, and we'll be wrapping up here in the fourth quarter. So to the extent we still maximize gasoline, even to the extent we could, based on the operating posture we had for this turnaround, and we'll make the brand at full rate. So that's really -- so we'll just see how the fourth quarter wraps up with respect to the gasoline crack in the West Coast. Gary Simmons : I guess, the final one around Memphis, the river levels have been impacting us at our Memphis refinery, both the ability to clear the refinery and supply the river terminals. As of this morning, both northbound and southbound traffic out on the river is wide open, expected to be there for the next couple of weeks and we expect the situation to improve. Jason Gabelman : Great. Thanks. That colors are really helpful to think about 4Q. And then the other one just on low carbon opportunities within your portfolio. In addition to the DGD venture, you also have an ethanol business, and it seems like with the carbon capture project that you're installing there and the Inflation Reduction Act, maybe ethanol to jet is a technology that makes sense, particularly given weaker ethanol margins. Is that something that you're looking at either to complement any SAF growth you would pursue within DGD or as an alternative investment instead of pursuing SAF near-term within DGD? Thanks. Jason Fraser : Yeah. So that's definitely something on the radar for us. As you said, ethanol carbon, carbon captured ethanol will be eligible to get into SAF. And given our footprint and our Navigator project, it will be in \u2013 SAF is a possibility with that ethanol product post-sequestration. So it's definitely sort of a somebody on the radar to look at sort of post 2025 when Navigator comes online. Jason Gabelman : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we're showing time for a final question. The final question today is coming from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering Holt. Please go ahead. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just had one question on the DGD guidance. If I heard it correctly, it was still $750 million for the year, which I believe implies that Q4 volumes to be lower quarter-over-quarter despite starting up a new plant in November. Could you help us understand that? Is that just being a little conservative around the start-up, or is there a turnaround at the DGD 1 or DGD 2 that we should be keeping in mind? Jason Fraser : It's a little conservative. We are in start of the DGD 3. The plan is to ramp to full rates in November. So if you added that volume in, it will come in higher than the $750 million. But we're still lining the unit out and have yet to put feed into the Echo finer. So we won't know that detail until mid-November or so. So from a guidance standpoint, we decided to keep the guidance at $750 million. It's proven that we see that rate. Matthew Blair : That sounds good. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over for closing comments. End of Q&A: Homer Bhullar : Great. Thank you, Donna. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Obviously, feel free to contact the IR team if you have any additional questions. Thank you, everyone, and have a great week. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Valero's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Bhullar. You may begin. Homer Bhullar : Good morning everyone and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joe Gorder : Thanks Homer and good morning everyone. We finished the year strong with our refineries operating at 97% capacity utilization in a favorable refining margin environment. In fact, this is the highest refinery utilization for our refining system since 2018. I'm also proud to share that 2022 was the best year ever for combined employee and contractor safety, which is a testament to our long-standing commitment to safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible operations. As we saw during most of 2022, refining margins were supported by low product inventories, which resulted from the significant permanent global refinery shutdowns and the continued recovery in product demand. Our refining system also benefited from heavily discounted sour crude oils and fuel oils. These discounts were driven by increased sour crude oil supply, high freight rates, and the impact from the IMO 2020 regulation for lower sulfur marine fuels. Also, high natural gas prices in Europe incentivize European refiners to process sweet crude oils in lieu of sour crude oils, adding further pressure on sour crude oils. And our refining projects that are focused on reducing cost and improving margin capture remain on track. The Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023 and will increase refinery's throughput capacity and ability to process incremental volumes of sour crude oils and residual feedstocks while also improving turnaround efficiency. In our Renewable Diesel segment, we continue to expand operations, and we set another sales volume record in the fourth quarter with the successful commissioning and start-up of the new DGD Port Arthur renewable diesel plant in November. That project was completed under budget and ahead of schedule and brings DGD's annual production capacity to approximately 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. In the Ethanol segment, BlackRock and Navigators carbon sequestration project is still progressing on schedule and is expected to begin start-up activities in late 2024. We expect to be the anchor shipper with eight of our ethanol plants connected to this system, which is expected to result in the production of a lower carbon intensity ethanol product that should significantly improve the margin profile and competitive positioning of the business. And we continue to advance other low-carbon opportunities such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable hydrogen and additional renewable naphtha and carbon sequestration projects. Our gated process helps ensure these projects meet our minimum return threshold. On the financial side, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, paying off all of the incremental debt incurred during the pandemic and ending the year with a net debt to-capitalization ratio of 21%. Looking ahead, we expect low product inventories and continued increase in product demand to support margins, particularly for US coastal refiners that have crude oil supply and natural gas advantages relative to global refineries. And we continue to see large discounts for heavy sour crude oils and fuel oils that we can process in our system. The startup of the Port Arthur Coker is also expected to have a significant earnings contribution in the back half of 2023, supported by wide sour crude oil differentials and strong diesel margins. In closing, we're encouraged by the refining outlook, which, coupled with the contribution from our strategic growth projects in refining and renewable fuels, should continue to strengthen our long-term competitive advantage and shareholder returns. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the fourth quarter of 2022, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $3.1 billion or $8.15 per share, compared to $1 billion or $2.46 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $3.2 billion or $8.45 per share compared to $988 million or $2.41 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. For 2022, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $11.5 billion or $29.04 per share compared to $930 million or $2.27 per share in 2021. 2022 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $11.6 billion or $29.16 per share compared to $1.2 billion or $2.81 per share in 2021. For reconciliations to adjusted amounts, please refer to the earnings release and the accompanying financial tables. The Refining segment reported $4.3 billion of operating income for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $4.4 billion compared to $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021. Refining throughput volumes in the fourth quarter of 2022 averaged 3 million barrels per day. Throughput capacity utilization was 97% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Refining cash operating expenses of $5 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $0.14 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily attributed to higher natural gas prices. Renewable Diesel segment operating income was $261 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $150 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Renewable Diesel sales volumes averaged 2.4 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2022, which was 851,000 gallons per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. The higher sales volumes were due to the impact of additional volumes from the DGD St. Charles plant expansion and the fourth quarter 2022 start-up of the DGD Port Arthur plant. The Ethanol segment reported $7 million of operating income for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $474 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $69 million compared to $475 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.1 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2022. The higher operating income in the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily attributed to multi-year high ethanol prices due to strong demand and low inventories. For the fourth quarter of 2022, G&A expenses were $282 million and net interest expense was $137 million. G&A expenses were $934 million in 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense was $633 million and income tax expense was $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. The annual effective tax rate was 22% for 2022. Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $12.6 billion for the full year. Excluding the unfavorable change in working capital of $9 million in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion in 2022 and the other joint venture member share of DGD's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $4 billion for the fourth quarter and $13.8 billion for the full year. Regarding investing activities, we made $640 million of capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2022, of which $349 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and $291 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture members share of DGD and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $538 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $2.3 billion for the year, which is higher than our annual guidance primarily due to project spend timing on the Port Arthur Coker project and the accelerated completion of the DGD Port Arthur plant. Moving to financing activities. We returned $2.2 billion to our stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $6.1 billion in the year, resulting in a 2022 payout ratio of 45% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities through dividends and stock buybacks. With respect to our balance sheet, we completed additional debt reduction transactions in the fourth quarter that reduced Valero's debt by $442 million through opportunistic open market repurchases. As Joe noted earlier, this reduction, combined with a series of debt reduction and refinancing transactions since the second half of 2021, have collectively reduced Valero's debt by over $4 billion. We ended the year with $9.2 billion of total debt, $2.4 billion of finance lease obligations and $4.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was approximately 21%, down from the pandemic high of 40% at the end of March 2021, which was largely the result of the debt incurred during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we ended the year well capitalized with $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2023 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About $1.5 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and $500 million to growth. For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.59 million to 1.64 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.95 per barrel. With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2023. Operating expenses in 2023 should be $0.49 per gallon, which includes $0.19 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce 4 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.51 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $130 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $655 million. For 2023, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $925 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, please adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. Please respect this request to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Theresa. Theresa Chen : My first question is related to \u2013 good morning. Related to your macro outlook over the near-term. And with respect to Russia, how do you see the EU embargo or price cap on Russian products imports playing out, specifically to the diesel as well as the geo situation? Gary Simmons : Theresa, this is Gary. I think, initially, we felt like even with the ramp-up in sanctions, you would just see a rebalancing of trade flows much like we saw with crude and resids. Most people in the trade today think that the sanctions will actually result in a reduction in Russian refinery utilization, and you'll see lower exports of VGO and diesel coming out of Russia when the sanctions take place. Theresa Chen : Got it. And clearly, there's been a focus on an elevated amount of maintenance in the first half of this year, plus some unplanned downtime. How big of an impact do you think this will be on near-term refining economics? How real do you think this is? And what are the implications on your own refining earnings taking into account that you have your own maintenance program to work through as well? Gary Simmons : Yes. So the market is very, very tight. We're looking at total light product inventories 55 million barrels below the five-year average. And so typically, this is a period of time where you see restocking take place. And with the winter storm outage and high maintenance activity, we just haven't been able to restock inventories which sets the year up very nicely in terms of refinery margin perspective. Lane Riggs : And Theresa, this is Lane. So as we've been pretty consistent, we don't do a lot of commentary around our turnaround activity. But nonetheless, I mean, the first quarter and third quarters are heavy turnaround periods when we have turnarounds. And so that's sort of seasonally, that's how we execute our maintenance. Theresa Chen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Happy New Year, guys for those I haven\u2019t spoken to you yet. Joe Gorder : Thanks, Doug. Doug Leggate : Joe, I don't know who you want to direct this too, but I'm curious about coker economics. When you laid out the original plan to bring this online, we were in a very different diesel resid market than we are today. So could you -- as you see the earnings power of that facility as it stands, maybe at strip or however you want to characterize it, can you give us an idea what your expectations are relative to what it looked like when you first set out the project? And I've got a follow-up, please. Joe Gorder : Yes. No, Doug, we'll let Lane take a crack at this one. Lane Riggs : Hi, Doug. I hope you\u2019re all right. It's -- so just to remind everybody, our FID, I think, was $325 million, that's sort of based on mid-cycle. We sort of look back at it in sort of 2018, I think the EBITDA was around $420 million. If you sort of fourth quarter, it's in the order of probably $700 million, maybe a little bit more dollars. So if you use those kind of margins. So obviously, it's -- I don't know if we have incredible foresight, but it's great to be lucky. And we lucky to be good, that's exactly right. So yes, I'd say have assuming all this holds, and I think, at least for our outlook, at least for this year, is that the sort of resid prices and distillate cracks a whole, it will be a -- the timing is pretty perfect. Doug Leggate : Just to be clear, and I know you don't want to be specific on timing, but would you anticipate this up by the end of the second quarter, or how are you thinking about start-up? Lane Riggs : I'm going to be fairly specific right here. We're going to be mechanically complete somewhere late Feb, early March, and we expect oil in somewhere late April or early May. Doug Leggate : Joe, I hate to do this, but I got to ask the cash return question. Your balance sheet, you've managed it or Jason, maybe, back to below COVID levels. Your dividend still hasn't moved and your share count is now down, I guess, about 7%. So, all things considered, it seems you've got a lot of capacity for dividend to restart dividend growth. How can you walk us through what you're thinking on cash returns? Thanks. Joe Gorder : Yes. No, Doug, that's a very fair question and we'll let Jason share his strategy around this. Jason Fraser : Yes, I'll give a little context quarter, we did beat a goal, which will kind of change in how we look at things. So, back prior to the pandemic, we were frequently at the high end or even above our target return payout range of 40% to 50%. Now, during the pandemic, we were very committed to our dividend and paying the dividend loan put us way above our 40% to 50% target range. And as you know, during COVID, we had to take on another $4 billion of debt in 2020. So, one of our main objectives as the financial situations improve post-COVID was the payback this incremental debt, which we've been aggressively working on. And we've messaged that while we're working on this competing goal of deleveraging, we would stay at the lower end of our 40% to 50% payout range, which is what we've been doing. Now, in the fourth quarter, we were able to repurchase $442 million of debt, which is the final step in us meeting our goal of deleveraging by $4 billion. So, with that insight, during the quarter, we increased our stock purchases to $1.8 billion and we're able to end the year at a 45% payout ratio. So, we're able to work our way back to the midpoint of our target range for the full year. And now that we've paid off our pandemic debt and build our cash balance up to a good level, you should reasonably expect us to be looking at mid-level or higher payout targets given the construction margin environment as we move forward. Now, on the dividend side, please go ahead -- yes, you'd asked about dividend too, which is other pieces of the puzzle. So, we continue to aim for a dividend as sustainable and competitive versus our peers. We would also like to show growth. And as you know, the dividends -- we hadn't had any growth since the first quarter of 2020 because, first of all, we had the pandemic, which we had to work our way through. And then we're rebuilding cash and working our debt down. So, now, as I've said, we've kind of met those goals so we would like to return to a pattern of growth as we move forward. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the full answer, Jason. As you know, Joe, we'd like to see cash on the balance sheet. So, thanks so much for that. All the best. Joe Gorder : Net zero debt, Doug. Doug Leggate : Thank you everybody. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read : Yes, good morning. I guess I'd like to jump in here on just, call it, crude structure in the market, right? We had big SPR releases a lot of last year. Those seem to have at least, I don't know if I'd say ceased, they've definitely eased quite a bit. You mentioned the Russian sanctions coming up. That's really more of a product thing. And then we've had the Venezuelan barrels start to enter the Gulf of Mexico. So, I guess as a broad question, how are you looking at crude availability and crude dips as we get into the early days of 2023 here? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, this is Gary. I think our outlook on crude quality differentials is we expect the market to stay fairly consistent. The key drivers really on the quality differentials have been more sour crude on the market, refineries running at high utilization rates, which produce more high sulfur fuel oil. And then with the IMO 2020 regulation, it's decreased the demand for high sulfur fuel oil. And so all those factors come into play, affecting the supply/demand balances around high sulfur fuel and then high sulfur fuel really drives the quality discount. So we don't see much changing at least in the near-term in terms of where those quality differentials are. Roger Read : And as a follow-up on that, I think, Joe, you mentioned with the Russian ban, we might see less VGO in the market. Maybe, Gary, those were your comments. If there's less VGO in the Atlantic Basin in general, what is your expectation for substitute feedstock into the summer of the secondary units and the kind of follow-on impacts on distillate production? Lane Riggs : Hey, Roger, this is Lane. I'll take a shot at it. I think what you'll see, and we were concerned about it going into this past year was the VGO availability, but we sort of through with some of the way some of the refineries in the Middle East started up. And I think some people stockpiled VGO, I mean, the answer to that is it will remain tight. And ultimately, what it affects is gasoline production. If you believe distillate cracks are going to hang in there where they are, you'll have clear margins by VGO into a hydrocracker, but it will challenge FCC's economics through the summer, it's in fact, as it gets tight. Roger Read : Great. I'll \u2013 that's my two, so I'll leave it there. Thank you. Lane Riggs : Thanks, Roger. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from John Royall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Royall : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I was hoping for your view on China reopening and how that could trickle through the market, particularly when you think about the new refining capacity coming on and they appear to still be releasing big batches of export quota. So anything on China reality would be helpful? Thanks. Gary Simmons : Yeah. So this is Gary. I think we've certainly seen the Chinese more active in the market, both purchasing feedstocks and in the product markets as well. It looks to us like a lot of the product exports from China are staying in the region, although we occasionally see some exports making their way into our market. But our view is that, you'll see significant demand recovery in China by the second quarter. And a lot of that ramp-up in refinery utilization in China will be needed to supply the domestic demand. On the new refinery capacity, at least our supply-demand balances still show year-over-year demand will outpace capacity additions. And so we're not too concerned about it. A lot of that capacity really doesn't make a lot of transportation fuels. Some of the big refineries in China, it's less than 50% total gasoline, jet and diesel yield, a lot more petrochemicals and fuel oil production. John Royall : Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then on the Renewable Diesel side, can you talk about how the feedstock market is absorbing DGD 3 and assuming this is the case, why it's been kind of easier than having pushed up advantaged feedstock the way it did with DGD 2? Eric Fisher : Yeah, this is Eric. We haven't really seen a big change in feedstock costs with DGD 3 coming on. As you said, we did see a big change where waste oil feeds really equilibrated to soybean oil with DGD 2 in 2021. But with the start-up of DGD 3, we've seen prices hold pretty flat. We saw that soybean oil actually, at least CBOT \u201csoybean oil\u201d, came pretty flat to waste oils in October and November. But then we saw the \u201csoybean oil\u201d drop really with the EPA announcement on their RFS obligations for the next three years. And so \u2013 but overall, to answer your question, we haven't seen a big change in feedstock prices. It's been pretty stable. John Royall : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Sam Margolin : Good morning. Thank you. Joe Gorder : Good morning, Sam. Sam Margolin : So in the prepared remarks, you mentioned European energy cost driving optimization opportunities in the US via a lot of different factors. But energy costs in Europe have crashed and diesel cracks are still rising and those optimization opportunities are still there. Can you talk a little bit about maybe what's going on in Europe from your perspective that's kind of sustaining these advantages even though the gas cost side is maybe out of the equation? Lane Riggs : I'll start and if Gary wants to sort of add. This is Lane, by the way, Sam. So natural gas still at the UK and really in the Netherlands is still nominally around $20 per million BTU. When comparing that today, sort of the Houston -- I mean probably nominally three and change. So there's still a significant difference between natural gas cost now. With that said, we'll use our Pembroke refinery as a proxy. Natural gas really hasn't driven our signals in over a year. And so I guess what I'm saying now we don't have an SMR and we're not -- we don't have a big hydrocracker, so we don't have a lot of insight into how that flows through to their marginal economics on those units. But what I'm saying is it's high natural gas prices. In Europe, at least for us, it hasn't changed our signals, which is macro run max at our Pembroke refinery. Sam Margolin : Okay. That's really helpful. And then I guess just as a follow-on, it's a little bit related, but it's back to Port Arthur. I mean the coker is starting up at this high run rate, and you've got a new renewable diesel facility there that's very cost advantage if for no other reason than just its integration with the refinery. So this is facility that's probably the most valuable fuels complex in the world at this point, I would say. And I don't even know what the question is, to be honest with you, but I'm just trying to get contribution to the system. Lane Riggs : We like where you're going, Sam. Sam Margolin : Yes. I mean if it has -- if it's dragging up the entire Gulf Coast system with it because of optimization opportunities that it comes with, I mean, just sort of I guess, a plant level contribution would be helpful. Lane Riggs : What was that last question? Homer Bhullar : Contribution at the plant level? Lane Riggs : Yes. We can't really say that. We do appreciate your comments around it. I mean -- if you think about what this coker does, at least, it reduces -- well, heavy the refinery up and our intermediate purchases sort of if you think about our VGO comments will be down significantly. So the better integrates sort of vertically integrates that refinery and makes it way less sort of, as you said, it's a very important asset. It makes us way less, I'd say, significantly less dependent on intermediates to fill out the refinery. Joe Gorder : And then obviously, the renewable diesel plant, there is going to be very helpful. So you're right, Sam, it's a very valuable complex to us. Sam Margolin : All right. Well, thanks so much. Have a great day Joe Gorder : You too. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys. Good morning. Joe Gorder : Good morning. Paul Cheng : Can I go back into Port Arthur, mainly with the coker coming on stream, we understand that, I mean, one of the decisions behind is that you will allow you doing the turnaround, you can still won the facility. But during the long-term around period, how that impact Port Arthur in terms of the cruise lay of throughput and product yield? Lane Riggs : So are you talking about the turnaround portion of it? Are you just--? Paul Cheng : No, outside of it. I mean, we understand the turnaround Now, you have two coker. Lane Riggs : That\u2019s what I've alluded to a little bit-- Paul Cheng : But I'm more interested if it is not doing the turnaround, how the new coker addition will impact in terms of your [indiscernible], your product, yield and your overall throughput? Lane Riggs : So, as I said to Sam, it's -- we'll heavy up considerably. Today, we run some light and medium crudes. You'll see us run significantly more heavy, maybe plus rate, probably over time. I'd looking back at the FID some, but it's not as much as you would think. And in terms of distillate, that's really the net product we make out of this, and it's sort of a plus 15% to plus 25% depending on the crude die in terms of distillate. What it really is, is a reduction in feedstock purchases for us. In addition to like we said, it's a turnaround efficiency. Paul Cheng : Right. So, we assume that is a 55,000 barrel per day, so you will see incremental one of heavy and mediums to the tune of 150,000 barrels per day? Lane Riggs : I'm sorry, Paul, can you repeat that? Paul Cheng : Now, the coker, the capacity is 55,000 barrels per day. Should we assume we're heavier up by about 150,000 barrels per day of the heavy and medium sour crude? Lane Riggs : No, we're not increasing 50,000 barrel per day. We're heavying up. You'll see our rates. I don't normally go from -- I don't know if it's public here, I got to be careful. [indiscernible] We run anywhere from 340 to 360 today, 375, depending on the crude die. I think we could potentially go up plus 30 to plus 40 on crude depending on how heavy we are or light we are. So, that's sort of what happens. And so then it just changes. When we do this all the time whenever we change our crude die, we sort of have to spot in intermediate purchases to finish our conversion units out. So, what will happen is we'll reduce the amount of intermediate purchases depending significantly on the base and tuning the refinery between how heavy we are and how we'll change sort of the how crude run rates. So, -- but it's not a plus 150,000. Paul Cheng : No, no, I'm saying not the overall throughput increased by 150,000, I'm saying that, will you increase the run of heavy and medium sour crude by 150,000 barrels per day with this coker? Joe Gorder : Will it increase? Lane Riggs : We would have to get back to you. It's going to be a lot. I mean, I have to go back and see how much we incremented on in terms of the volume. So, -- and we'll have to get back with you. We can get back with Homer disclose that I don't know. I don't know what-- Paul Cheng : And second question is that in your North Atlantic, the margin in this quarter is really, really strong, even comparing to the benchmark indicator. Can you maybe help us better understand that what may be some driver outside just the market conditions? Yes, any? Lane Riggs : So Paul, which margin -- Valero's overall-- Paul Cheng : North Atlantic -- your North Atlantic? Lane Riggs : Well, I didn't really -- it's not that much stronger versus the prior quarter. I mean, just the way we look at it is\u2026 Paul Cheng : North Atlantic we see [ph] -- I think $29. Lane Riggs : No, but I'm saying versus prior like I said. Homer Bhullar : Capture was only up a margin. Lane Riggs : Yeah. Capture rate was up just a little bit. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe \u2013 a follow-up on some things that you maybe touched on a little bit earlier on the call. I think from a macro point of view, as some of the \u2013 what appear to be at least whether they're structural or lingering improvements and kind of underlying profitability for the business. It seems like the global system is exceptionally tight in terms of generating low sulfur product, and maybe that's a post IMO effect. But is that a fair statement? Have you seen kind of a post IMO have you seen a structural change or tightness in the ability of the global refining system to generate ultra-low-sulfur product? And is that something that sticks with us for a long time and on the margin drives higher distillate margins? Gary Simmons : Yes, I think so. So you can see that a couple of places, you can really see at the low to high spread on fuel oil, you can certainly see the gap that's occurred and then just general weakness in high sulfur fuel. I think it tells you that the industry really is tight on capacity to upgrade high sulfur fuel into low-sulfur products. And we've really seen that starting early last year, and it's continuing, and we don't see anything that changes that. Ryan Todd : Right. Thanks. And then maybe just one on the renewable diesel side. I mean early guidance for the 2023 to 2025 time frame didn't appear very supportive for renewable diesel on its surface. Any thoughts on what your takeaways were overall, whether you see the market as potentially oversupplied this year? And whether this may result in pushing more marginal players out of the market? Obviously, you have a structural cost advantage, so you're on the low end of the curve. But do you expect \u2013 I guess, how did you read the guidance? What do you think the impact will be over the next year or two on the market? Jason Fraser : Well, so one thing that we saw with the RFS obligation is that they kept the ethanol target at 15 billion gallons, which means you're still going to be in a situation at some point in the year where you have to use the D4 RIN to cover the D6 obligation because the ethanol blending won't reach 15 billion gallons. So that mechanism is still in there. To your point, the future obligations were higher, but not as high as people expected. And when you saw that announcement come out, you did see a big drop in soybean oil prices as well as a lot of pressure on \u2013 or question on whether or not all these soybean crush facilities were going to get built based on that lower obligation going forward. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag that, there's still going to be short on the D6 RIN, but there is definitely a lower growth curve on the D4 RIN in this current proposal. So we'll have to see how that plays out. There's still a lot of talk about a lot of the policy trying to move away from soybean oil as a feedstock, both in Europe and in the US, at least in terms of conversations. And so as everyone's trying to figure out is that part of what's at play with this lower RFS proposal. So \u2013 but overall, as you said, we're a waste oil units that isn't affected by that. And as you said, we will be competitive regardless of the obligation compared to our peers. So we'll have to see how the -- we'll just have to see how this plays out. I don't know, Rich, you had other comments about the future outlook on the RFS proposal. I know we're\u2026 Rich Walsh : Yeah. I mean, one thing I would hit on is the elements that they put in that's probably the thing that we find most problematic with the rule. EPA is trying to convert the RFS into a subsidy for EVs, for autos. And, obviously, we'll be commenting very heavy on that. We feel that the RFS is really set out by Congress and the intent was for it to be used to promote liquid renewable fuels like the use of soybean and corn and for ethanol. And we don't think trying to convert this into some kind of a user it for EV purposes really is consistent with the underlying obligations and intent of Congress with the RFS. Ryan Todd : Good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Connor Lynagh of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Connor Lynagh : Yeah. Thanks. I, kind of, want to continue that line of questioning there. I appreciate this is a little bit ridiculous since you just brought DGD 3 online. But what is the policy vision make you think about DGD 4 or some of the opportunities that you'll have when you have your carbon capture system online for your ethanol plants? Just where is your head on where future renewables growth for you guys might be? Gary Simmons : Well, previously, we said we would take a pause after DGD 3 and reassess the market. So we're -- like you said, we're still lining out DGD 3. Its project went great. It came in under budget. It was nine months ahead of schedule. It's met design. It's met its design rates already. And I'll just say that the project team, the operations team and the fuel compliance team did a great job making this a very smooth start-up, and we're not having any problem moving sales out of DGD 3 into markets. So as I said before, we haven't seen an increase in feedstock prices. So everything looks very competitive with DGD3 coming up. That all being said, I think we continue to do the engineering on the SAP project. For the DGD platform, and then we continue to support the Navigator pipeline for the CO2 sequestration for our ethanol plants. So all of that still says that there's a lot of opportunity with our platform, given its location and competitive position. Connor Lynagh : What's your thinking around exploring potential alcohol to jet or other avenues to approach the SAF market. Rich Walsh : Yeah, I think there's two things. Obviously, what's key to that is that the sequestration project has to go first. In order for ethanol to qualify for SAF, you have to get below the 50% GHG targets for the EU. And so if you look -- if you assume that pipeline is done in the next couple of years, it will qualify our ethanol platform into SAF. And so the other thing that we've learned is with the SAF projects, you still have to blend that with conventional jet to make the final SAF product. So if you think about our platform, we have the ethanol, we have the carbon sequestration and we've got the conventional jet on the refining side. It does look like we would have a lot of advantage in just a complete supply chain into a finished SAF product. So that all looks like it's something we will continue to look at as we get closer to reality on this carbon sequestration pipeline. Connor Lynagh : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Yes. Good morning, team and congrats on a great quarter. The first question was around jet cracks. We're seeing that premium relative to diesel really blow out in some markets. Would love your perspective on -- do you think there's a structural premium in jet? And how do you see those premiums playing out over time? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think in the short-term, a lot of what you're seeing, the premiums on jet are primarily in New York Harbor in the Florida market. And it's still a bit of an overhang from the winter storm outages that we had in the US Gulf Coast, causing those markets to be exceptionally tight. It looks to us like probably mid-month in February, you'll get some resupply, which will help jet supply in those regions. But overall, we expect jet demand to increase significantly this year and overall, a lot of tightness in the distillate markets. Neil Mehta : That\u2019s helpful. That to follow-up is around just the demand levels. I mean, we've historically anchored to EIA on some of the US demand levels and the numbers are noisy. I mean in the last four-week trailing number was down 11%, which is hard to reconcile with the fact that disti is 20% below the five-year from an inventory perspective in gasoline below the five-year as well. So just would love to hear what you're seeing through your own wholesale system in terms of demand? And any thoughts on real-time color there? Gary Simmons : Yes. So we share the view that the DOE numbers look low to us and we would expect them to be corrected going forward. Our wholesale numbers are trending pretty high. So gasoline volumes through our wholesale channel are about 12% above where they were pre-pandemic levels, which we don't necessarily think is representative of the broader markets either. For us, I think the number which we focus on are more around the mobility data, which is kind of showing vehicle miles traveled flat to slightly above where it was pre-pandemic levels with some improvements in the efficiency of the fleet, it would say gasoline demand down maybe in the 2% range is what we kind of believe is most likely. Neil Mehta : That makes more sense. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Gabelman : Good morning. I got a couple of questions. First, I wanted to ask about the US Gulf Coast intermediate imports, the resids, and I understand some of that's going to be backed out with the Port Arthur Coker project, but you'll probably be taking some in-sell. And as these resid differentials have widened throughout the year, I imagine it's been a pretty large benefit to your capture rates in 2022. So I was hoping you could help frame that? And if you expect resids the discount to stay wide in 2023 and continue to contribute to stronger captures despite your commentary that you expect some of the Russian VGO to be taken off the market? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Lane Riggs : So this is Lane. I'll start on that. I mean, I think we'll probably -- we always look at heavy crude versus fuel oil. I mean one of the things that's happened sort of Russia big buyers have been 100 out of Russia. And obviously, we don't buy that anymore. So we've canvased the world and figured out alternative sort of fuel oil feedstocks and they're plentiful largely based on what Gary has mentioned. I mean, you have a lot of incremental crude going into low complexity and they're struggling making sulfur. So you can see that in the 3.5 weight percent discount to virtually everything else. And so we do believe that's going to continue. I think through this year. So, at Valero, you'll see us buy more heavy crude, we want post coker, and you'll see us buy some more fuel oil and less intermediates. Gary Simmons : Yes. So, the only thing I would add is for the full year 2022, resid probably didn't have a significantly positive impact on our capture rates just because after the Russian sanctions and those barrels came off the market for really the second and third quarter, it was rebalancing the trade flows. But in the fourth quarter, we certainly saw a significant impact. Jason Gabelman : Got it. Thanks. And my follow-up is on DGD. Given the start-up of DGD 3, I suspect there was a larger distribution to the joint venture partners. So, I was wondering if you're willing to disclose what that distribution was? And now that you're going to likely moving forward to have more access to the cash from DGD in the form of ongoing distributions, does that impact how you think about the payout ratio at all? Thanks. Homer Bhullar : Maybe I'll start on just on the DGD side, it just started up. We haven't even got to the conversation with cash distributions yet. But the expectation is this year, it should be with capital spending coming to a close with the project that there should be more cash spinning off from the joint venture. I don't know, Jason, if you comment-- Jason Fraser : Yes, that's right. With having DGD 3 finish, we'll have excess cash. And they're always looking at new capital projects and maybe they'll find another way to deploy it otherwise, there should be cash coming out. And we do include that in our calculus when we're looking at payout ratios, but I guess that's all I had on it. Jason Gabelman : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from William -- I'm sorry, Matthew Blair of TPH. Please go ahead. Matthew Blair : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Good morning everyone. Do you have any early thoughts on the Q1 2023 refining capture rate? It seems like we might want to be just a little conservative here. I think you're refining guidance implies like 86% to 89% utilization. So, probably a heavier turnaround period. And then some other factors like butane blending and octane spreads still good, but looks like they're coming down from Q4 levels. So, I guess, directionally, does that make sense that we want to be more conservative on capture in Q1 and anything else we should consider there? Lane Riggs : Yes, I don't know that you need to be more conservative on capture rates. Obviously, we have seasonal maintenance. We'd have to look at the material balance and figure out how that actually impacts the sort of the dollars per barrel capture rates. So, I wouldn't jump to conclusion of changes, but appreciably from Q4 to Q1, both quarters, you're blending butane both quarters, you have fairly wide sour discounts. So, I don't -- we'll just have to see how that plays out. But obviously, we have some maintenance occurring, our turnaround were occurring in Q1 and that's normal for us. That's -- when we do turn around, this is a heavy quarter for us versus the rest of the year. Matthew Blair : Got it. And then for DGD, how should we think about the feedstock mix going forward? Your old guidance was one-third fat, one-third corn oil, one-third uco [ph], but you started up DGD 3 and your partners acquired production. So, it seems like we might want to inch up maybe a little bit on the fat compared to that one-third guidance, maybe inch down on the uco, is that fair? And do you have anything more specific on that? Rich Walsh : Well, I guess, we don't normally get into that level of detail on feeds. What I would say is the whole DGD platform is big for waste oils. And so it's always going to favor the and tallows and inedible corn oil over other feeds from a CI standpoint. So how each of those individual feedstocks play is always \u2013 that's very dynamic. And the thing I'd say is what we do see, maybe just to add some color, is we are running a lot more of international feedstocks, both coming from Darling as well as just more broadly in the world. So \u2013 and those are waste oils. We ran some veg oil in the fourth quarter because as we spoke earlier, the prices of it became attractive. But going forward, I think it's always going to be some mix of those three waste oils as the most attractive feeds. Matthew Blair : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We're showing no additional questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Bhullar for closing comments. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Donna. I appreciate everyone joining us today. Obviously, if you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thanks, everyone, and have a great week. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com.  Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our earnings release and filings with the SEC.  Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks. Joseph Gorder : Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter with all of our segments performing well. Our refineries operated at 93% capacity utilization rate despite planned maintenance at several facilities. Our ability to optimize and maximize system throughput while undertaking maintenance activities illustrates the benefits from our long-standing commitment to operational excellence. Refining margins were supported by lower industry refining capacity in a backdrop of strong product demand.  I'm also proud to report that the Port Arthur coker project was completed in March and successfully started up in early April, which is a testament to the strength of our engineering and operations teams. The project is expected to increase the refinery's throughput capacity and ability to process incremental volumes of sour crude oils and residual feedstocks while also improving turnaround efficiency.  Our Renewable Diesel segment set another sales volume record in the first quarter, with the continued ramp-up of DGD Port Arthur, which was started up in November 2022. In January, we announced that DGD approved a sustainable aviation project at Port Arthur, Texas. The DGD Port Arthur plant will have the capability to upgrade approximately 50% of its current 470 million-gallon annual renewable diesel production capacity to sustainable aviation fuel or SAF. The project is expected to be completed in 2025 and is estimated to cost approximately $315 million, with half of that attributable to Valero. With the completion of this project, DGD is expected to be 1 of the largest manufacturers of SAF in the world.  In the Ethanol segment, BlackRock and Navigator's carbon sequestration project is progressing, and they expect to begin start-up activities in late 2024. We expect to be the anchor shipper with 8 of our ethanol plants connected to this system which will allow us to produce a lower carbon-intensity ethanol product and significantly improve the margin profile and competitive positioning of our Ethanol business.  And we continue to advance other low-carbon opportunities, such as renewable hydrogen, alcohol to jet and additional renewable naphtha and carbon sequestration projects. All of our projects must meet a minimum return threshold to continue to progress through our gated review process. On the financial side, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, reducing debt by $199 million in the first quarter and ending the quarter with a net debt to capitalization ratio of 18%.  In January, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.98 per share to $1.02 per share, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to stockholder returns.  Looking ahead, we expect refining fundamentals to remain supported by low global light product inventories, tight product supply and demand balances and continued increase in product demand as we approach peak air travel and summer driving season.  In closing, our team continues to successfully execute a strategy that enables us to meet the challenge of supplying the world's need for reliable and affordable energy in an environmentally responsible manner. The tenets of our strategy, underpinned by operational excellence, deploying capital with an uncompromising focus on returns and honoring our commitment to stockholders have been in place for nearly a decade and continue to position us well for the future. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Joe. For the first quarter of 2023, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $3.1 billion or $8.29 per share compared to $905 million or $2.21 per share for the first quarter of 2022.  First quarter 2023 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $3.1 billion or $8.27 per share compared to $944 million or $2.31 per share for the first quarter of 2022. For reconciliations to adjusted amounts, please refer to the earnings release and the accompanying earnings release tables. The Refining segment reported $4.1 billion of operating income for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $1.5 billion for the first quarter of 2022. Refining throughput volumes in the first quarter of 2023 averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 130,000 barrels per day higher than the first quarter of 2022. Throughput capacity utilization was 93% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 89% in the first quarter of 2022.  Refining cash operating expenses were $4.78 per barrel in the first quarter of 2023, lower than guidance of $4.95, primarily attributed to higher throughput and lower natural gas prices.  Renewable Diesel segment operating income was $205 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $149 million for the first quarter of 2022. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 3 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2023, which was 1.3 million gallons per day higher than the first quarter of 2022. The higher sales volumes in the first quarter of 2023 were due to the impact of additional volumes from the start-up of the DGD Port Arthur plant in the fourth quarter of 2022.  The Ethanol segment reported $39 million of operating income for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $1 million for the first quarter of 2022. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.2 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2023, which was 138,000 gallons per day higher than the first quarter of 2022.  For the first quarter of 2023, G&A expenses were $244 million and net interest expense was $146 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $660 million, and income tax expense was $880 million for the first quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate was 22%.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Excluding the unfavorable change in working capital of $534 million in the first quarter and the other joint venture member share of DGD's net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion.  Regarding investing activities, we made $524 million of capital investments in the first quarter of 2023, of which $341 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance, and $183 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture members share of DGD, capital investments attributable to Valero were $467 million in the first quarter of 2023.  Moving to financing activities. We returned over $1.8 billion to our stockholders in the first quarter of 2023, of which $379 million was paid as dividends and $1.5 billion was for the purchase of approximately 11 million shares of common stock, resulting in a payout ratio of 52% of [indiscernible] net cash provided by operating activities.  With respect to our balance sheet, as Joe mentioned, we completed additional debt reduction transactions in the first quarter that reduced Valero's debt by $199 million through opportunistic open market repurchases. We ended the quarter with $9 billion of total debt, $2.4 billion of finance lease obligations and $5.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents, was 18% as of March 31, 2023.  And we ended the quarter well capitalized with $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash.  Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2023 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About $1.5 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and the balance to growth. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect Refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.73 million to 1.78 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 405,000 to 425,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 250,000 to 270,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. We expect Refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $4.60 per barrel.  With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2023. Operating expenses in 2023 should be per gallon, which includes $0.19 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.  Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.2 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.  For the second quarter, net interest expense should be about $145 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $670 million.  For 2023, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $925 million.  That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Manav Gupta with UBS. Manav Gupta : Congrats on a very good result. I'm not sure if there are many other refiners out there who can show this kind of capture with such heavy turnaround. So congrats on that. I have two quick questions and I'll ask them upfront. We keep seeing DOE data, which is prone to revisions, but sometimes doesn't actually make too much sense. So Joe, in your system across various products, what are you seeing in terms of demand for various products in your system?  And the second and related question is, help us understand a little bit what's going on in the diesel market. Are we suddenly oversupplied? Is the demand weak? If you could just talk through those diesel dynamics. Joseph Gorder : No, Manav, we're happy to do that, and thanks for your comments. Gary, do you want to give them some insight? Gary Simmons : Yes, sure. So, so far, our 7-day average in our wholesale system, our gasoline sales are up 16% year-over-year. Our diesel volumes are up 25% year-over-year. So our wholesale team continues to do a great job.  In March, we set a record at 998,000 barrels a day. In April, the volumes are trending right along those levels. So demand seems very, very strong in our system. And even the DTN data for the wholesale racks across the industry is very strong as well.  In terms of your question on diesel weakness, we're just not seeing it. I can tell you, in addition to the wholesale volumes, today, there's domestic arbs that are open from PADD 3 into PADD 2 as we're seeing a surge in agricultural demand that's going along with planting season. You also have a domestic arb open to ship from PADD 3 to PADD 1. We see strong waterborne premiums to go to Latin America. The transatlantic arb is open to Europe. And so for us, distillate fundamentals look pretty good. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Theresa Chen : Can you comment on your outlook for Gulf Coast capture from here? Clearly, the start-up of the Port Arthur coker should be a tailwind, but we've also seen differentials come in. Net-net, how do you view the profitability of your Gulf Coast system, both near term and longer term? Lane Riggs : Yes, this is Lane. [indiscernible] some general comments about capture rates, sort of compare our first quarter capture rate to our second quarter capture rate. Holding all things equal, we'll blend less butane. So everything -- pulling everything equal, our capture rate will actually fall just due to butane. And then as you alluded to, you look at feedstocks, what's the trajectory of feedstocks, they're lower.  On the other side of it, we're seeing big RBOB premiums versus CBOB. So to the extent that, that's not captured in our capture rate, that's actually a positive.  So there are several things you just got to look at. And what you got to focus on are the -- some of the drivers that may not be in our formula for our crack attainment and how those change relative to things those are tied to. An example would be Maya versus WCS or, like I said, RBOB versus CBOB. Those are the things you guys kind of key on trying to predict maybe how our crack attainment looks. Theresa Chen : And on a related note, how do you see the BGO situation evolving in terms of your Gulf Coast consumption as well as the global supply following the EU embargo on Russian products as well as the Saudis exporting less after [indiscernible] on its conversion unit? Lane Riggs : Well, I'll start on at least our system and let Gary kind of look at -- talk about the supply. The start-up of our Port Arthur Coker goes a long way to shoring up our VGO position. Essentially, that's where it is. It's taking resid and heavier crudes and cracking into sort of -- in the distillate and essentially a VGO boiling range material. So it allows us to sort of -- our requirement for importing VGO has fallen post the new coker startup. Gary Simmons : Yes. In terms of supply, I think we were concerned that the ramp-up in sanctions against Russia would limit VGO exports and cause VGO tightness. So far, it looks like the Russian barrels are continuing to flow. And so we're not nearly as concerned about VGO supply as we were earlier in the year. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Kalei Akamine : This is Kalei on for Doug. I've got a follow-up to Theresa's question, and it really goes to the availability of heavy sours that are in the market. There is a perception that, that length is getting shorter with OPEC cuts and then increased demand from new projects such as your coker and perhaps MPC's resid hydrocracker are squeezing the market for those kind of supplies. Can you talk about what you guys are seeing and if the phased start-ups of the new refineries, where not all the units are online, could help alleviate that situation. Gary Simmons : Yes. So I'll go through. We have seen -- during the first quarter, we saw the supply-demand balances around heavy sour get tighter. Some of it is supply. You also see -- saw Chinese refinery utilization ramp-up, which put more demand in the system. But going forward, I think there are some bullish factors. Platts is reporting 500,000 barrels a day. Canadian crude production is off-line due to maintenance. We'll get that production back. Venezuelan production is forecasted to grow. And our view is that more Chevron production from that region will make its way into the Gulf as we progress through the year.  At some point in time, all indications are that the Lyondell refinery will come down, which will kick more heavy sour back to the market. And then if the demand and -- the supply-demand balances that are currently being forecasted are correct, at some point in time, you'll need that OPEC production back on the market, which again is bullish to differentials. Kalei Akamine : Got it. And a quick follow-up to that. Can you talk about what you're seeing for new refining capacity that's supposed to come online, like Dangote and Dos Bocas in Mexico? Gary Simmons : Yes, I really can't make a comment. We don't have a lot of insight into either one of those refineries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Just wanted to start on the return of capital side. You guys returned above your 40% to 50% range again this quarter, I think second quarter in a row. What's your latest thinking on where you want to be in that range of returns to shareholders given your balance sheet is very strong, but fundamentals appear to be ticking down and you can see that in your indicators. Jason Fraser : Yes. No, that's right. This is Jason. And you're right, our balance sheet is in good shape right now. We've got up over $5.5 billion of cash, we feel pretty strong there. We got our net debt to cap ratio down into a good spot around 18%, which is well at the lower end of our range. So we feel like we're in a pretty good spot with regard to any potential recessionary conditions. And as far as our target for where we want to be in our range, we'll continue to target the 40% to 50% when we have strong results. Of course, we'll be looking at the upper end. of that. We ended at 45% last year, paid out 52% this quarter. Actually with the extra cash we had, we did kind of an all-of-the-above strategy, we were able to build our cash by $600 million. Payout at 52% and also paid back a little more debt. So it will just depend on how the year plays out, where we fall in the range, right, in the payout range. John Royall : Great. And then I was hoping you could also touch on the regulatory changes out in California and how you expect those to play out and the potential impact on both your business and maybe just the broad refining market in California. Richard Walsh : This is Rich. I can start out with just sort of the regulatory climate. California has always been a tough regulatory climate for operations. And so I'm assuming you're talking about the California 2 rulemaking that's out there. And what we would just say is that the bill does have some burden, some reporting requirements in it. And then obviously, it kicks basically a profit tax over to this California Energy Commission to implement it. And so we'll stay active and engaged in that rulemaking process and watch what develops out of the agency there. It's unclear what price cap, if any, they'll ultimately put in place.  I would point out that the rulemaking on that, the standard that the agency is supposed to use is they're supposed to determine that the benefits to consumers are outweighed by the potential cost to consumers. And it goes without saying that attempts by governments to artificially limit commodity prices has never been really good for the economy and it ultimately ends up hurting consumers. So we'll just have to see how that all plays out. Joseph Gorder : And John, this is Joe. Just let me bolt on something to what Rich said. So it's -- we have a great team operating both of our refineries on the West Coast. Great teams are running those plants. And we have been very consistent and clear in our approach to the California business. That is we aggressively manage the capital, we invest to maintain safe and reliable operations out there, but we haven't invested capital in growing that business for many years now.  Now historically, California, in a normal operating environment, isn't a strong contributor to our earnings. We've always viewed it as an option on periodically strong margins. And if the margin caps are set at levels that remove the upside, the opportunity to earn a return isn't there the way it's been in the past and we'll have to evaluate our options.  Right now, Rich and his team are communicating to the California Energy Commission and others the concerns that we have, and we're just going to have to wait and see what happens out there. So it is an environment that is a difficult operating environment. I would not even take a shot at stating what might happen to the overall refining environment out there, but I can just tell you that from our perspective, we're just going to have to watch it and see and then we'll evaluate our options. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Paul Sankey : Could you repeat the wholesale sales demand number that you just gave and explain how come, if I heard you right, that's growing so massively. Gary Simmons : Yes. So our wholesale on the gasoline side, we're up 16% year-over-year. On distillate, we're up 25% year-over-year. March, we set a sales volume record 998,000 barrels a day. And then April, the volumes are trending about like they did in March.  So certainly, when you look at the broader DTN wholesale volume data, it's not as significant growth is what we're seeing, and so it indicates we're doing a good job of capturing market share. Paul Sankey : So there's no structural change. It's just better wholesale performance? Gary Simmons : Yes. Okay. I'm not counting that as a question, Joe. Joseph Gorder : Paul, we could talk all day. Paul Sankey : I'm in D.C. actually. On the IRA, what's your latest thinking on how that could impact your business in terms of the regulatory environment? We've had -- we've dealt with the California one, I think, on the call already, but if you've got any latest thoughts on how things in Washington are shifting.  And the other one, I guess, is a big deal here. Obviously, it's carbon capture and how you're thinking about that. Richard Walsh : Well, this is Rich Walsh again. I guess I'll take an effort to respond on that in terms of -- I think you're probably alluding to some negotiations that are going on right now. And just this morning, I think the Republican bill has been revised to include some of the credits to be back in that they were proposing to pull out. And so we're looking at the clean energy tax credits being put back in, and so the things that help us on our renewable side and some of our sequestration projects back in.  And they also have grandfathered those that have already made investment decisions on the [indiscernible] while SAF is out, the projects that have been announced on SAF are back in. So that means our projects would be still eligible for the proper treatments on that. Paul Sankey : Yes. Got it. I think that SAF is definitely a very interesting one. Okay. And then generally speaking, in the market, we've seen margins come off an awful lot, which is a bit odd seasonally. Is there anything that you can observe about -- especially given what you're saying about your wholesale margins, your wholesale deliveries. The big sell-off that we've seen here is somehow doesn't seem to be entirely supported by fundamentals. We had a great gasoline demand number, for example, this week in the . Any thoughts on how Q2 is going to shape out? And I'll leave it there. Gary Simmons : Yes, Paul, our view is whenever inventory is as low as it is today, it just puts you way out on the margin curve where the slope is really steep and any type of market news can have a significant impact on prices and margins. So early in the year, the market headlines were all about losing Russian supply with the ramp-up in sanctions and it drove the market up. Today, I think people are generally comfortable that the Russian barrels will continue to flow and then a lot of concern on the economy and what happens with demand in the future. As I've said, we're not seeing any indication of demand weakness today, but I think that's a concern is what happens in the future. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes, I'd like to follow up, Joe -- I'd like to follow up on the Comments or how you're looking at the diesel and gasoline markets. I mean there's a ton of ways to track demand and shortfalls of supply. But one we pay attention to is each end of the Colonial pipeline, and it shows clear stress in the gasoline market. So I guess I'd like to dig into maybe what you see in the Atlantic Basin, particularly between New York and Northwest Europe in terms of just outright gasoline supply. Or is it a component issue? Or what exactly is going on there? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think there are several factors that come into play there, Roger. Historically, we see an incentive to store summer-grade gasoline or components to New York Harbor. This winter, the market structure really made it where it wasn't economic to do that. And so we did build inventory for that.  And then, again, typically in the first quarter, you see a lot of volume going across the Atlantic from Europe into New York Harbor early in the year, and the strikes that occurred in France kind of minimized those volumes as well. So we've come into driving season with 10 million barrels below where we were last year on gasoline inventory. So especially summer grade gasoline is very tight, and it is going to stress the Colonial system as we move into driving season. Roger Read : Yes. I mean it's early in the quarter, but really haven't seen the gap quite this large at this time of the year before. So it definitely shows stress. Follow-up question, if I could, on the SAF. Obviously, you mentioned there are some opportunities in terms of what's moving forward legislatively. If you weren't to see, let's call it, fundamental support for SAF margins, do you want to make SAF? I mean, what's the driver to do that versus renewable diesel which obviously already enjoys support as well as LCFS programs. Unidentified Company Representative : Roger, this is Eric. I think we still see a big demand for SAP in the future. The EU just talked about mandating it beginning in 2025 and at increasing percentages as you get to 2030 and 2050. So the IRA isn't the only driver for SAF. I think, between what we see in different jurisdictions starting to obligate jet and make it a mandatory requirement as well as just the internal commitments that a lot of the airlines and cargo carriers have made from a corporate standpoint, we still see that SAF is going to be a strategic growth area for renewables. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe I'll stick for one follow-up on the low carbon fuel side. Can you talk a little bit about a couple of the carbon possibilities that you mentioned earlier in the call, you mentioned renewable [indiscernible] alcohol jet. What would either of those projects look like in your current operations? And are there further changes in product prices or regulatory support that would be required to make either of those businesses make sense? Unidentified Company Representative : Well, I think -- this is Eric again. In particular, we'll start with ethanol to jet. Assuming the Navigator project goes forward, that will lower the carbon intensity of our ethanol to a point where it will qualify as a feedstock into SAF. And so if you look at that as the precursor project that would then enable an ethanol to jet SAF project, that's one of the things we're looking at. Now that's years out from anything we would talk about in any sort of detail, but conceptually that's kind of what would line up that possibility from a project standpoint.  And then renewable hydrogen, that's another sort of horizon opportunity, that as you look at your low-carbon platforms, if you can make blue or green hydrogen, it's just another way to further lower your CIs on your low carbon operations. Ryan Todd : Great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the Port Author coker. Is there -- congratulations on getting that started up. Is there any sort of ramp associated with operations there? How should we expect kind of contributions to that in the second quarter? And any kind of updates or thoughts on what the -- what you think the annualized EBITDA contribution is in the current environment? Lane Riggs : Yes, this is Lane. So we started it up on April 5. I would say actually, this week, we've sort of ramped up most of the refinery up to where we're running. We're close to fuel to full. We're sort of from now through the rest of the quarter, you will see the [indiscernible] benefit of [indiscernible]. Clean start-up, as Joe alluded to earlier in his comments. It was done really well by our team. It's working just as we had indicated.  In terms of the contribution on EBITDA, when you take sort of the current volumetrics and use forward pricing on it, it's normally about $0.5 billion a year is the benefit. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : I wanted to ask one on market structure. I think there's some concern because there's headlines around Asia cutting refining runs because margins are low there and there's some concern that, that could permeate into the U.S. And so the question is, how should the market kind of take that indicator? Should they think that while Asia margins are falling and so U.S. will follow because there's global weakness? Or conversely, because Asia margins are falling, U.S. cracks are around the level they are, probably closer to a floor, because of the structural kind of tailwinds that are out there and Asia is kind of absorbing all of the throughput declines related to global demand issues? I know it's a bit of a complex question, but I guess, give it a shot. Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think the way we would view it is much like you said, we would view it as it's kind of telling us where the floor on margins. It's not just Asia, but in Europe margins are negative. And so a lot of that is the distillate weakness. We still see diesel inventory very, very low. And we view that some of that capacity should actually be running. And so it's kind of telling you we're the floor on where margins are. Jason Gabelman : Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up on DGD. Where are we in terms of the DGD distribution? Have you received one yet? Is that coming soon? And how are you thinking about that cash being moved up to the partners moving forward? Unidentified Company Representative : Yes. We've looked at the DGD cash flow, and we would still say we see a distribution in the back half of this year becoming an opportunity for the partners. Jason Gabelman : Okay. Any idea around the quantity? Unidentified Company Representative : No, we're not going to give a number like that out, but it does look positive through the end of the year. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew Blair : Joe, could you help us understand the Q1 refining capture, a strong figure, a little bit more. I think Lane mentioned butane blending was a tailwind. What else drove it up? And I guess, specifically, were product exports more of a supporting factor than normal? And then also, was there any impact from turning in the 2021 RINs, like any sort of mark-to-market as you submitted the 2021 RINs in March of 23? Lane Riggs : So Matt, this is Lane. I'll start out with the first part of it. So the things that are contributing factors were we had backwardation sort of flattened out in the market on feedstock. That's always one you get. So market structure plays into capture rates in a big way. So it's tightened out some. You had wider differentials in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter on all the crudes that we run.  And then finally, there were pretty good jet premiums versus distillate in the first quarter. Those -- those are the other things driving our capture rate. With respect to the other on mentioned... Joseph Gorder : I don't think the RIN had anything to do with it. Gary Simmons : And I wouldn't say exports had any kind of material impact on capture rates either. Matthew Blair : Great. And then on the Q2 Refining guidance, it looks like it implies about 90% to 93% utilization. You already did 93% in Q1. So I guess I'd be surprised if it ticks down. Is that just -- should we think about it as just a conservative number? Or are there -- are there major turnarounds that we should be aware of that's pulling down your Q2 expected run rate? Lane Riggs : Yes, we -- this is Lane. We have a policy of not really commenting directly on our turnaround activity, but I would just take the guidance to be kind of where we think it's going to be. Joseph Gorder : Yes. And Matthew, I mean, you know our history and our tendency. I mean we're not going to oversell anything. So we'll just -- we'll see how the markets look. And lane's right, we'll operate as appropriate. Operator : We have no additional questions at this time. So I'll pass the floor over to management for any additional closing remarks. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Jesse. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Obviously, feel free to contact the IR team if you have any questions. Have a great week. Thank you, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our call and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance. Thank you. Please go ahead. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With me today are Lane Riggs, our CEO and President; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and COO; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted financial metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our earnings release and filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Lane for opening remarks. Lane Riggs : Thank you, Homer, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss quarterly results, I want to thank Joe Gorder for everything he's done to build upon Valero's 43-year history. Joe steered a repositioning of our strategy and the commitment to shareholder returns through capital discipline, innovation and strong execution. I'm grateful for his leadership and proud of what Valero has accomplished, and I'm honored to build on that foundation as we continue to advance our position as a leading manufacturer of liquid transportation fuels. Moving on to quarterly results. We are pleased to report solid financial results in the second quarter, underpinned by our strong execution across all of our business segments. Our refineries ran well with throughput capacity utilization of 94% as refinery margins were supported by continued tight product supply and demand balances. Product demand was strong with our US wholesale system setting a sales record of over one million barrels per day in May and June. We also had a positive contribution from the Port Arthur Coker project, which was started up in early April and is operating well and at full capacity. The new coker has increased the refinery's throughput capacity and enhance its ability to process incremental volumes of heavy crude and residual feedstocks. Our Renewable Diesel segment set records for operating income and sales volumes in the second quarter, driven by incremental production volumes from Diamond Green Diesel, Port Arthur. The Diamond Green Diesel sustainable aviation fuel project at Port Arthur is progressing on schedule. Plan is expected to have the ability to upgrade 50% of the current 470 million gallon annual renewable diesel production capacity through Sustainable Aviation Fuel or SAF, is expected to be complete in 2025 and have estimated a cost of $315 million, with half of that attributable to Valero. With the completion of this project, DGD is expected to become one of the largest manufacturers of SAF in the world. These projects expand our long-term competitive advantage, and I want to commend our projects and operations team for their dedication and execution. We also continue to evaluate other opportunities while maintaining capital discipline and honoring our commitment that all projects meet a minimum return threshold. On the financial side, we returned 53% of the adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter. And we ended the second quarter with a net debt to capitalization ratio of 18%. Looking ahead, we expect low global light product inventories and tight product supply-and-demand balances to continue to support refining fundamentals. Global demand for transportation fuels has recovered substantially with gasoline and diesel demand now comparable to pre-pandemic levels and jet fuel demand continues to increase steadily. In closing, we remain committed to the core strategy that has been in place under Joe's leadership for nearly a decade. Our focus on operational excellence, capital discipline and honoring our commitment to shareholder returns have served us well and will continue to anchor our strategy going forward. So Homer, with that, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Lane. For the second quarter of 2023, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.9 billion or $5.40 per share compared to $4.7 billion or $11.57 per share for the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2022 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $4.6 billion or $11.36 per share. . The Refining segment reported $2.4 billion of operating income for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $6.2 billion for the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating income was $6.1 billion for the second quarter of 2022. Refining throughput volumes in the second quarter of 2023 averaged 3 million barrels per day, implying a throughput capacity utilization of 94%. Refining cash operating expenses were $4.46 per barrel in the second quarter of 2023, lower than guidance of $4.60, primarily attributed to lower-than-expected natural gas prices. Renewable Diesel segment operating income was $440 million for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $15 2 million for the second quarter of 2022. Renewable Diesel sales volumes averaged 4.4 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2023, which was 2.2 million gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2022. The higher sales volumes in the second quarter of 2023 were due to the impact of additional volumes from the start-up of the DGD Port Arthur plant in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Ethanol segment reported $127 million of operating income for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $101 million for the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2022 was $79 million. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.4 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2023 which was 582,000 gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2022. For the second quarter of 2023, G&A expenses were $209 million and net interest expense was $148 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $669 million and income tax expense was $595 million for the second quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate was 22%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2023. Excluding the unfavorable change in working capital of $1.2 billion in the second quarter, and the other joint venture member share of DGD's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in its working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion. Regarding investing activities, we made $458 million of capital investments in the second quarter of 2023, of which $382 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance; and $76 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture members share of DGD, capital investments attributable to Valero were $433 million in the second quarter of 2023. Moving to financing activities. We returned over $1.3 billion to our stockholders in the second quarter of 2023, of which $367 million was paid as dividends and $951 million was for the purchase of approximately 8.4 million shares of common stock resulting in a payout ratio of 53% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. Last week, we announced a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.02 per share payable on September 5, 2023, to holders of record at the close of business on August 3, 2023. With respect to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $9 billion of total debt, $2.3 billion of finance lease obligations and $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt-to-capitalization ratio net of cash and cash equivalents was 18% as of June 30, 2023. And we ended the quarter well capitalized with $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2023 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About $1.5 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and the balance to growth. For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect Refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.77 million to 1.82 million barrels per day; Mid Continent at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 240,000 to 260,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 435,000 to 455,000 barrels per day. We expect Refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be approximately $4.70 per barrel. With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2023. Operating expenses in 2023 should be $0.49 per gallon, which includes $0.19 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.4 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the third quarter, net interest expense should be about $145 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $690 million. For 2023, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $925 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Manav Gupta of UBS. Manav Gupta : Guys, I just want to quickly start with and congratulate Gary for the promotion and the new rule and all our best wishes are with you. The first question I have for you is that when we look at DGD, you guys have a track record of bringing projects online before time. So is there a possibility a year down the line, you could take a look at it and say, we would like to have similar upgrades possible at DGD 1 and 2 to make more sustainable aviation fuel on a go-forward basis? Eric Fisher : Yes. Manav, this is Eric. Obviously, that is a possibility because those are cookie-cutter units, and we could do the exact same project at St. Charles that we are currently underway at Port Arthur. It's too early to talk about any numbers or commitment, but yes, that's definitely something we're looking at and something that we could do. Manav Gupta : Good. The second question here is the DOE data is telling us whatever it is, and there are obviously some concerns around demand out there, but the cracks are telling us a completely different story. The cracks are telling us the demand for products is remarkably strong. So just wondered if you could highlight some of the -- what you're seeing in terms of demand in various regions? Gary Simmons : Yes, Manav, this is Gary. We do believe that the DOE is understating gasoline demand. But even their data is showing on a 4-week average basis gasoline demand up about 3%. But if you look at our numbers, of course, Lane mentioned we had record volumes in both May and June of over 1 million barrels a day. We're seeing gasoline sales in our system up 14% year-over-year, up 22% from pre-pandemic levels. Gasoline inventory year-over-year is down 7.5 million barrels. So it's trending at the low end of the 5-year average range. Typically, this time of year, you have an open arb to ship barrels from Europe into the United States. But with inventory low in Europe, that arb is closed, which is hindering imports, and we see strong export demand from the U.S. Gulf Coast into South America. So the fundamentals around gasoline look very good. Diesel inventory is up 6 million barrels, but continues to trend below the 5-year average range. Diesel inventory is flat, where historically, this time of year, we start to see diesel building. Again, while the DOE reflects weaker diesel demand year-over-year, it looks like the weekly data is continually being revised up. So although we certainly that we had a weaker heating oil season, diesel demand looks fairly similar to last year. So we moved forward a lot of encouraging signs around diesel where we saw weaker tonnage index in the second quarter, the June data reflects that the tonnage index is picking back up. We'll start to see more agricultural demand as we get into harvest season and more heating oil demand as we get into colder weather. Continue to see very good export demand from the US Gulf Coast into South America. Some of that has fallen off as we've replaced some supply with Russian barrels, but largely been replaced with more export demand from the US Gulf Coast into Europe. Jet demand also picking up, and had a positive impact on overall distillate supply-demand balances, so the distillate demand looks up 10% year-over-year. It looks pretty strong. All the airlines are reporting very strong demand. Jet trading at a $0.10 per gallon premium in the US Gulf Coast on a rent-adjusted basis today. So, yes, the fundamentals look very, very good. Manav Gupta : Thank you so much for the detail response. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from John Royall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Royall : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my first one was just on the coker. It sounds like you're running full now in the start-up went as planned. But maybe you can just go through any puts and takes around profitability? I know heavy diffs have come in, for example, the diesel cracks are improving recently. Should we think about there being a structurally higher Gulf Coast capture now? And any way to think about quantifying that? Greg Bram : Hey John, this is Greg Bram. So as Lane mentioned, the Coker started up in April. And I think it's probably worth noting the project and operating teams did a great job bringing that unit online safely without incident. And that's after we accelerated the schedule last year to be in a position to capture value from that project here in 2023. We've ramped it up to full capacity over the course of the quarter, and it's running well and median expectations. And I think with that, you can take kind of the guidance we've given in the past and think about where the market is today and adjust accordingly. I don't think we have really a new or different view, because the project is really doing what we expected it to do. John Royall : Great. And then maybe along the same lines, it would be great to get your thoughts on heavy and medium sour diffs from here with OPEC+ cutting and the second round of the STR release is now over. What are your thoughts on whether we'll see a widening from here on mediums and heavies or will we likely stay in the current environment where from a sour diffs perspective? Gary Simmons : Yes, this is Gary. I think we have seen the discounts widen back out some as we've moved throughout the third quarter. I think there's some reason for optimism as we head into fall turnaround season, had two and three, you'll see some decreased demand for heavy sour crude, which will help the differential some. I think we'll see some more production growth out of Western Canada as they come out of maintenance season, which would put more barrels back on the market, should continue to see a ramp-up in Chevron production from Venezuela heading into the US Gulf Coast. And then finally, there's some seasonal factors which should help the discounts as well. High sulfur fuel oil for power burn will begin to wind down seasonally, which will put more high sulfur fuel on the market, help the discounts there. And then as we transition into winter weather, you would expect to see higher natural gas prices, which changes the economics for some refineries around the world that have been processing medium and heavy sour crude, which have helped the discounts as well. John Royall : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : Good morning. On the SAF front, would you mind giving an update on the Navigator BlackRock CCS project? And how is the permitting and right-of-way procurement process going? Richard Walsh : Hi Theresa, it's Rich. I'll start out by saying that the Navigator project is progressing. They've got parallel proceedings in front of each of the state's respective utility boards and/or counties and the regulatory proceedings in Iowa are taking longer than they anticipated. And so Navigator is not expecting regulatory approval until the back half of 2024, which will naturally push their timeline back. And they've not announced -- and they haven't given any update on a new start-up schedule. So-- Theresa Chen : Thank you. And in terms of additional SAF opportunities in the DGD facilities, Eric, can you just opine a bit more on how would you think about like the key hurdles it would take to cross to commercialize additional FID? Eric Fisher : Yes, I think what I would say about SAF is the airlines are still in very much an educational phase of this. What they're still trying to wrestle with is I think there is a good understanding of it's going to come from RD. They're starting to understand the credit markets and how they work. But as you know, all of these SAF demands, a lot of them are voluntary from the carriers and as well as because it's voluntary, they've got options on, do they want to accept allocation, do they want to accept -- which model do they want to operate under, where in the world do they want to run these barrels? And I think the learning that everyone is working through right now is conventional jet is a fungible product. And so the SAF will naturally move into fungible markets, just like jet fuel does. But as airlines want the specific molecule at their particular location, particular airport, even at the airports, it then becomes a fungible product. So, all of that becomes a conversation of, okay, how do you then take that sort of real-life logistics and apply it into these policies and goals and how do you want to set up a commercial deal with that? So, there's still a lot of details being worked through on how this will physically move into the market. And then as a result of that, how it will price. So, I think airlines are still -- we're still working through a lot of those details. I don't see any drop in interest or demand. We see demand still growing strongly through 2030. So I think there's still a lot of upside in this outlook. I think it's -- but we have to work through these commercial details and logistical details. Theresa Chen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning everybody. Gary, perhaps I could pick on you a little bit given your recent good news. Congrats from me as well. But diesel, a couple of months ago, the world was coming to an end in terms of consensus expectations. And today, we're back at winter-type premiums for distillate cracks. So, I know you touched on it already in some of your comments. But can you maybe speak to what you're seeing that's driving that strength? And I want to address specifically what you're seeing in Asia as it relates to trading. Our understanding is Chinese exports are down and maybe that's creating some globally. So, I'm just wondering if you can offer any perspective as to why the split is as strong as it is today? Gary Simmons : Yes, I think you definitely saw as China ramped up and they didn't have the domestic demand keep up with that initially, you saw a lot of Chinese exports. Some of those barrels were making their way into Europe. And then you had some trade flows that needed to rebalance with the Russian sanction. So, initially, we saw a decreased demand from Latin America and so diesel was starting to back up in the US. But as trade flows have rebalanced, the Russian barrels that are making their way into Latin America that gap has largely been filled by increased demand from Europe. So, if you look for -- in our system in the second quarter of last year, our export is pretty comparable to the second quarter of this year. However, last year, 95% of our volume went to Latin America, 5% to Europe. Second quarter of this year, we had 60% of our exports go to Latin America with 40% to Europe. So you're starting to just see a big pull of diesel from the U.S. Gulf Coast into Europe. We thought in the second quarter and thus far in the third quarter, that's continuing. And that's the real difference. Doug Leggate : So I hope this isn't a second question. This is kind of a clarification question. So are you suggesting that Russian exports are starting to -- they're starting to slow, which I think was the expectation. Is that -- am I reading your comments correctly? Gary Simmons : We have seen Russian exports slow, I don't know, if that's just maintenance activity occurring in Russia, what's driving it. But we have seen some of the South American demand that we feel like we lost the Russian barrels that those countries are back inquiring for supply from us again. Doug Leggate : Okay. Thank you. My follow-up is on capture rates. And it seems to us -- I mean, Refining looked in line with consensus for this quarter. The balance was pretty weak capture in the Mid-Con and North Atlantic. So I'm curious if you can walk us through whether that's transitory, if there was anything specific in the quarter? And how you see it trending so far in the third quarter? Whoever wants to take that? Thanks. Greg Bram : Yeah, Doug, this is Greg. So as you mentioned, overall capture rates were pretty consistent with what we'd expect from a 1Q to 2Q move. I should mention from the earlier question. In the Gulf Coast, the Coker was a positive impact, the new Coker on capture rates in the Gulf. As you mentioned in the Mid-Con, lower there primarily due to turnaround activity and you can see that in our lower throughput rates in second quarter versus the first quarter. And then in the North Atlantic, we tend to always see a seasonal shift in the value of Canadian distillates up in that market strong in the winter and then coming off in the spring and summer time. So that was one of the effects we saw there. Then the one that was a bit more unique to this particular period was just higher cost for sweet crude coming out of Canada, primarily impacted by some maintenance and also the wildfires they had up there. Doug Leggate : And how is that trending in Q3? Greg Bram : Yeah, we're starting to see it moderate a bit, but it will take some time. That usually is not just a very short, short-term effect, but we expect that it will start to improve. Doug Leggate : All right. Thank you, guys. Greg Bram : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Paul Sankey of Sankey Research. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey : Good morning, everyone. Greg Bram : Good morning, Paul. Paul Sankey : My congratulations to Gary. Can you just keep going a little bit with the outages? On the OPEC cuts, can you talk a little bit about the impact that you've been having on markets from your perspective? The Mexican explosion was another obvious one, just a commentary on how disruptive the crude market is from a buyer's point of view right now? And I got you on Russia you seem to more or less address that already through Doug. Thanks. Gary Simmons : Yeah. So certainly, the big move in the crude market has been the OPEC+ production cuts, 4.5 million barrels a day off the market. And I think you're seeing that as global oil demand picks up, and those barrels are not yet back on the market, you're seeing flat price trend higher, and you've definitely seen it in the quality differentials as well. But in addition to the OPEC+ cuts, there were a number of other issues that you mentioned. We had maintenance in Canada on the wildfires in Canada, the platform fire in Mexico. You kind of went from a seller out of the SBR to a buyer into the SBR. So all of those things had a significant impact on the quality differentials in the second quarter, and we're seeing some of those things start to reverse as we move into the third quarter. Paul Sankey : Got it. And then on the outages in Refining, can you talk a bit -- I mean there was reports of lots of different things happening, not least because of the heat in Texas. Could you talk a bit about anything that happened with you guys in the quarter, but also how the industry perhaps was perhaps throughput was a bit distorted by various units being down and stuff? Greg Bram : Paul, this is Greg. I don't know that we can speak a whole lot to what was going on elsewhere. Our operations were very good for the quarter. Good mechanical availability in line with kind of our typical first quartile type of performance. So the weather has had just a very modest impact on any of our operations. Paul Sankey : Got it. And then just finally, a quick one. The 14% you talked about wholesale up is obviously you're taking market share. It seems to be driven by your renewable fuels, right? Is that -- how do we explain the difference between your strength of sales versus the overall market being way below that? Gary Simmons : No. That wouldn't include really what we're talking about on renewables. That would be strictly our U.S. wholesale volumes. I think some of it was due to rationalization that occurred in the industry that allowed us to be more competitive, but we've gone through and in many locations, renegotiated terminal agreements that just allow us to be more competitive in some regions where we haven't been historically and capture additional market share. Paul Sankey : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Ryan Todd : Great, thanks. Maybe a question on the renewable diesel side. I mean can you talk -- obviously, a very strong performance in the quarter. Can you talk about sales in the quarter, which were, I mean, stronger than we had expected? Also had a very strong capture rate, which was much improved. And certainly, I think some benefit from pricing there. But can you talk about sales? What are the drivers there, implications as we look toward the back half of this year, both on sales and the kind of margin and capture on the renewable diesel side? Eric Fisher : Yes. We definitely had -- there's always some timing of ships in our numbers for the quarter, but we do also have the unit running above its original design capacity. So we are running higher rates at DGD 3 as well as seeing strong sales throughout the world as we move into a lot of production moving into Canada with its new CFR that went live in July, and then there's other states that are coming on beyond California. So overall, yes, we did see increased sales due to the combination of some timing of ships and then obviously, we're running above design rates. Ryan Todd : And on the on the margin cap just had. Any general comments on what you're seeing, I mean, headline indicators have been falling, but your capture was much improved. Eric Fisher : Yes. The margin -- on the margin capture side, we definitely saw prices lower in the second quarter. We saw waste oils become advantaged again. So that improves a lot of our capture rate. If we talk a little bit about RINs and LCFS, those have been pretty much as expected. LCF market has been relatively flat. The EPA came out with its new RIN outlook, and it was largely unchanged. So -- but overall, that's mostly a product. Gary mentioned, we've seen strong ULSD demand. That's the basis of the formula plus, I would say, more attractive fat prices, as you already mentioned. Ryan Todd : And maybe on a different note, with the start-up of the Port Arthur Coker and the capital rolling off from that in terms of growth CapEx, you obviously have the SAF projects underway, but what types of projects might compete for growth capital going forward? Is it more likely to be incremental SAF capacity? Are there things on the refining side that you're looking at, whether it's something to increase octane production or anything like that on the margin side that can compete for capital as you think about the next couple of years? Lane Riggs : Yes. This is Lane. So you can really expect us to continue to look to optimize and look at opportunities around our existing assets. We've been doing that. Some of them aren't big or flashy, but in cumulative, they'll have an effect on our overall performance, and we continue to gate those, just like we always have. And then in the other side of the business, our renewable side. We are looking at the potential to always the gain and develop innovative projects that are sort of in the transportation fuel space that leverage our operations excellence and our project execution capabilities. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thanks, Lane. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Joe Laetsch of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Laetsch : Great. Thanks everybody for taking my questions today. So I want to go back to capture rate here. So, we noticed just on the West Coast Refining margins were really strong during the quarter. Could you just touch on some of the drivers here and how we should think about the setup for the third quarter? Greg Bram : Yes, this is Greg. So on the West Coast, we had great operations out there. But really, the thing to note there is Benicia has a very, very high gasoline yield in terms of its product mix. So, when gasoline is very strong relative to distillate products out in the West Coast, we see strong capture rates out there driven by Benicia's yield. That's the primary factor you saw in the second quarter. Joe Laetsch : Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just -- my second one is just on OpEx and just the drivers of higher OpEx in third quarter versus 2Q. Is that on the gas side? Or how should we think about that? Lane Riggs : Let me -- this is Lane. It's really driven by slightly higher outlook for natural gas in the third quarter than the second quarter. Joe Laetsch : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read : Good morning and congrats to everybody on there for the new roles here. I'd like to hit the diesel question a slightly different way. Last winter, we saw pretty unusually warm weather throughout Northern Hemisphere. So going back, I think you addressed this on the last call, but what do you think the missing demand was last year from a weather standpoint. And so when we think about the upcoming winter and we always just model normal weather. So, what will we potentially be looking at from a demand step up? Gary Simmons : Roger, we have modeled that, but I don't have the number in front of me, and I don't want to give you a bad number, but we can follow up with you with Homer and get you the number we had on heating oil demand. Roger Read : Okay. That's helpful. The other is, we have, I think somebody mentioned earlier, seeing diesel move back up over gasoline. Can you give us an idea of how you've run in terms of being max diesel or I should say, max distillate or max gasoline as we've been coming through this summer? Greg Bram : Roger, we've been mostly in max gasoline mode, but we've been watching that movement between those two products. And we'll make that shift when we start to see that kind of swing cut drive us back the other way. One of the things maybe just to keep in mind is on that swing cut, as you keep that heavier part of the gasoline and the gasoline pool, it pulls in more butane into the blend pool. And when you look at where butane prices are currently that's really attractive to get as much butane in the blend as you can. Roger Read : Yes, NGLs are definitely help in or hurt depending on which side of the argument you're on there. Okay. Thanks, guys. Lane Riggs : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Hi. Good morning. Lane Riggs : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : Congratulations to everyone with new role. May be ask -- I apologize because I joined late. So if my question is ready to address, just let me know and we look at the transcript. Two questions. First, with the heavy oil discount and medium sour has also come down like most discount, it doesn\u2019t seems like it's really that attractive to-date. Is it really problem for you guys to run those barrels? And if it's not, is there any way that -- for you to further minimize and what is the minimum that you have to run? The second question is that in the law of Avantec, is there any reason why the margin capture jobs so severely from in the second quarter. I mean not just comparing to the first quarter, but comparing to the last couple of years that you've been running, say, call it 100%, 95% to maybe 120%. And so -- is there any particular reason or there is some one-off unit circumstances that we are seeing? Thank you. Lane Riggs : Hey, Paul, Mr. Bram is going to answer that. Greg Bram : Hey, Paul, I'll start with the first one on the different crudes. If I understood your question, we see incentive to run the heavy grades as well as the light track now. The advantage for heavy crudes narrowed quite a bit as we got into the quarter. As Gary mentioned, as those differentials start to move back out that will increase the incentive to move -- to continue to process the heavy grades. The medium sours have probably been the one that have been least attractive and we would need to see those be -- have a wider discount to the light sweet grade before we would start to make a shift there. On your question, your capture rate question. Paul Cheng : Actually, before we go into the capture, can I ask that how much that you can maybe further minimize on the medium sour? Greg Bram : Yes, we can minimize quite a bit. Paul, one thing to keep in mind is there's different parts of the country, different parts of even the Gulf Coast region, where the medium sours, particular grades will still be attractive to run and we'll process those in the places where that medium grade is not as attractive. The easiest way to think about it is, in a lot of cases, we can run a combination of heavy and light to essentially kind of mirror what a medium grade looks like, but do that at a lower cost than buying the medium sour crude itself. Paul Cheng : Okay. Understood. Greg Bram : Okay. The your capture rate \u2013 was around north Atlantic, Paul Cheng : Around North Atlantic. Yes. Greg Bram : Yes, Paul, primarily the one thing that was unique about the second quarter was the higher crude cost and again, driven by higher prices for Syncrude out of Canada, both maintenance and wildfire-related. That was probably the thing that caused, kind of, that region to look different this quarter than it would typically for a second quarter period. Paul Cheng : The Syncrude is probably was 100% -- 20% at most or for your entire more than 90 input, right? Greg Bram : No, it's much higher than that, Paul. Paul Cheng : Syncrude: Greg Bram : Yes. So our Quebec refinery runs a combination of Canadian crudes and then waterborne crudes that we bring up from the Gulf Coast. Paul Cheng : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is coming from Nitin Kumar of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Nitin Kumar : Hi. Good morning all and thanks for taking my question. I just want to start with, can you comment on the recent EPA decision to deny RFS favors for small refiners? And how does that look for your ethanol business I think you mentioned volumes were flat, but can you talk a little bit about pricing for ethanol? Richard Walsh : This is Rich Walsh. I can talk of, I guess, a little bit about the EPA decision. And then when it comes to pricing, I'll hand it back off to Eric. I mean, we don't have any small refinery exemptions in play. And so it's a bit of a non-factor for us. I mean really not a lot more to share on it in that regard. Eric Fisher : Yeah. And then as far as the commercial impact of that, it's a bit -- we see the same thing, but of a nonevent and we really don't know the compliance posture of those small refiners. So it's not -- we don't see a big impact to any of our businesses on the small refinery section. Nitin Kumar : Sorry, what I was actually referring to is on your commercial side, whether you were seeing any improved demand for ethanol because those that don't have the exemption. I guess I'll ask a different question as well. Just on the sustaining CapEx, you mentioned $1.5 billion for this year. Are you seeing anything on the regulatory front that could increase that or increase the intensity of your sustaining CapEx in the future thinking of things like stringent particle emission standards or anything like that? Lane Riggs : This is Lane. When you look at our history on our sustaining capital and some of these things, we were actually ahead of our competitors looking elective gas recovery and some of these other things. So with respect to regulatory capital, we're in good shape, and we're still willing to stick with our $1.5 billion of sustaining. On average, that doesn't mean it can ebb and flow really with turnaround timing. Nitin Kumar : Thank you Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Yeah. Good morning, team and Lane, Gary and Joe, if you're on the line. Congratulations to each of you. And that's kind of where I want to start. I mean, Lane, that over the last couple of years, the strategic vision has been very clear and consistent. We would just love your perspective as you step into this new role. What are the two or three things that you're most focused on to take Valera to the next level? Lane Riggs : Thanks, Neil. So I mean, Joe and I really -- I worked with Joe on the strategy for the last nine years. Obviously, Jill and I go way back before that. So it's not like I've been a part of the current strategy that's been successful. I don't think you should expect us to deviate substantially from where we've been strategically in terms of my areas of focus. I think the first area of focus is just making sure everybody understands exactly that, right? We are -- we have a -- we've been very successful in our execution, maintaining our operations excellence our ability to execute squarely and be great executor of the projects. And I want to make sure that, that continues. And I want to make sure that we stay disciplined, we stay predictable and those are all the things that I think I need to make sure that's going on for the foreseeable future. And a that, I'm going to let Joe keep working in this innovative project space look for our opportunities to spend some of our strategic capital and in some of these opportunities that are around our assets, whether Diamond Green or SaaS or some of the other things that we obviously have done been ahead of everybody else, and we think we can continue to be that company. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Lane. And then the follow-up is just around return of capital. And just maybe you could provide an update. It was another quarter where you were able to return cash in excess of sort of the brackets that you talked about historically. And how are you thinking about with the stock having done well here more recently, continuing to lean into the buyback versus reinvest back in the business and talk about the dividend as well. Lane Riggs : Yes. I don't think there's any revisiting of our approach to capital really strong performance. And I'm sorry, with regard to like buybacks and dividend we're going to continue our same approach as well. As far as going above our long-term target of 40% to 50% return to shareholders. Historically, back before the pandemic, we had been at the high end or above our target range pretty regularly. And then last year, we got back to the 45% midpoint of our range, while at the same time getting our debt back down to prepayment levels and building cash. So we got ourselves back in the good posture that we were comfortable with. And we'd also said with that accomplished, we'd be at the midpoint or above going forward. In the second quarter, like you said, we were up above our 50% range. We had a 50% -- 53% payout. Year-to-date, we're at a 52% payout -- so this year, we've clearly trended above 50%. And going forward, as in the past, as I said back before COVID was an unusual circumstance for us we won't hesitate to pay out above the upper end of the range for the year, where we think that's the best use of our excess cash under the circumstances. And on the dividend, we continue to have the same approach to it. We want our dividend to be positioned, we want our yield to be positioned competitive versus our peers who wanted to be growing and sustainable through the cycle. So that continues to be our approach on the dividend. That's how we'll set it and then the buybacks will continue to serve as a flywheel to round out our return to get us to our targets. Operator : The next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Gabelman : Yeah. Hey, thanks for taking my questions. First, I want to ask on the renewable fuel standard as well and the outlook for RIN prices and the impact of the business, there's a decent amount of concern that there's going to be an oversupply of RINs next year, and that has implications both for Diamond Green Diesel as well as on refining and the ability to capture some of the pass-through of the RIN cost in the crack. So I was wondering, if you have any comments around your RIN outlook as it relates to impacts to both of those segments given some risk to RIN prices moving lower next year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Eric Fisher : Yeah, this is Eric. On the RIN prices, the EPA held the ethanol requirement of 15 billion gallons, which as we've seen over the last several years, it's beyond the blend wall, which means the D4 RIN will be used to fulfill that obligation. Given our outlook, we don't see a big change in RINs. RIN prices or RIN supply you see that as relatively business as usual. Jason Gabelman : I mean, I guess if I could just push back a little bit. There is a lot of new renewable diesel capacity coming online next year. So it does seem like there's going to be a lot more RIN supply. I don't know if that enters into your thought process as you look out next year? Eric Fisher : Yes. If you -- we're not going to speak on everyone else's projects, but we do see that a lot of the R&D projects are taking longer to come up and their projects are being slowed down. So our outlook is the expected growth curve of R&D is not going to be as aggressive as a lot of predictions. Jason Gabelman : Okay. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is just going back to the outlook on cracks. And I think a lot of investors have been surprised that the strength we're seeing in cracks and so kind of two parts to this one. Do you think the kind of hotter-than-normal weather globally has supported diesel demand at all? You've already mentioned that you're not going to comment on refining operations of your peers in the warm weather. So wondering if there's been a demand impact, though, from the high weather? And then the second part is, -- can you talk about just given you mentioned inventory product inventories are low. The path forward to rebuilding those, given the global capacity seems to be running all out how does the world restock gasoline and diesel, which are at or below historical levels? Thanks. Gary Simmons : Yes, Jason, this is Gary. I don't know that we can see that the warmer weather has caused a significant change in diesel demand. I think where inventories are low in the United States, we're seeing the same thing globally. Low diesel inventories and a pull from the United States into -- especially into Europe, very high as a result of low inventory globally. Moving forward, I don't know really where the path is in terms of restocking the inventory. You look -- we're 35 million barrels below the five-year average. Last year at this time, we were 35 million barrels below the five-year average. So we really aren't making it dent in it. If you look going forward, yes, there's no refined capacity coming online, but -- when you look at the stated nameplate capacity, that new refining capacity and you look at the estimates of global oil demand growth, it doesn't look like a significant impact on the supply-demand balances going forward. Jason Gabelman : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Matthew Blair : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Do you have any thoughts on the expected impact on RD margins in 2025 when the BTC converts to a PTC. As we look at it, it appears the dollar per gallon subsidy would go down with the PTC, but then, it seems like you might be helped out by just less competition from foreign RD imports. Does that make sense on your end? And is there anything else you would add there? A \u2013 Lane Riggs : Yes, I think you've got that surrounded. The one thing I would add is when you go to a carbon intensity basis for the PTC, that will advantage Diamond Green Diesel because we run the lowest CI feedstocks. So whatever the PTC becomes, we will still have the highest capture of PTC versus our peers. So there's no doubt that it becomes a fraction of $1 based on CI but we'll still have the most advantaged platform. Q \u2013 Matthew Blair : Great. Thank you. And then on the ethanol side, is an alcohol to jet SAF projects still a long-term possibility? And could you -- if so, could you compare that to what you're doing currently at DGD? Like how do the two production techniques compare in terms of capital cost, operating cost, scale and do airlines distinguish between the two different types of fuel? A \u2013 Lane Riggs : Yes. I think -- yes, that's a lot of questions there. Well, what I would say is -- so the first question of is there a pathway to take ethanol into jet fuel. The answer is yes, post sequestration. That is -- it does allow ethanol to become a viable feedstock into that market. It's way too early to talk about numbers and capital and all of that from a from a project standpoint. But if you look at it from the airline standpoint, they do see that the first barrel of SAF that they will get ratably will be RD based. There is -- as that conversion goes through the RD markets, the next barrel could be from an ethanol source. But that's like you said, that's much further out there on the time line. So yes, and then if you look at in terms of -- is the technology there? And is there a capability there and will airlines differentiate between the two? Again, probably too soon to tell. But from a fuel standpoint, there's no difference between an ethanol-based barrel versus an RD based barrel from a SAF standpoint. But a lot of work to be done first on how RD will price SAF into the market, and then these are all much, much further down the time line. Q \u2013 Matthew Blair : Understood. Thanks for your comments. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Bhullar for closing comments. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Donna. I appreciate everyone joining us today, and please feel free to contact the IR team if you have any follow-up questions. Have a great day. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Homer Bhullar, Chief Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance. Thank you. Please go ahead. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With me today are Lane Riggs, our CEO and President; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and COO; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Although attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted financial metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our earnings release and filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Lane for opening remarks. Lane Riggs : Thank you, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong financial results for the third quarter. In fact, we set a record for third quarter earnings per share. Finding margins were supported by strong product demand against the backdrop of low product inventories, which remained at 5-year lows despite high refinery utilization rates globally. The strength in demand was evident in our U.S. wholesale system, which matched the second quarter record of over 1 million barrels per day of sales volume. Our refineries operated well and achieved 95% throughput capacity utilization in the third quarter, which is a testament to our team's continued focus on operational excellence. We continue to prioritize strategic projects that enhance the earnings capability of our business and expand our long-term competitive advantage. The DGD Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SaaS project at Port Arthur remains on schedule and is expected to be complete in 2025. Once complete, we expect the Arthur plant [ph] to have the optionality to upgrade up to 50% of its current of 470 million-gallon annual renewable diesel production capacity at SaaS. The project is estimated to cost $315 million, with half of that attributable to Valero. With the completion of this project, Diamond Green Diesel is expected to become one of the largest manufacturers of SaaS in the world. On the financial side, we honored our commitment to shareholder returns with a payout ratio of 68% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities through dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter and we ended the third quarter with a net debt to capitalization ratio of 17%. In closing, while there are broader factors that may drive volatility markets, we remain focused on things we can control. This includes operating our assets efficiently in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner, maintaining capital discipline by adhering to a minimum return threshold for growth projects and honoring our commitment to shareholder returns. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Lane. For the third quarter of 2023, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.6 billion or $7.49 per share compared to $2.8 billion or $7.19 per share for the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.8 billion or $7.14 per share for the third quarter of 2022. The refining segment reported $3.4 billion of operating income for the third quarter of 2023 compared to $3.8 billion for the third quarter of 2022. Refining throughput volumes in the third quarter of 2023 averaged 3 million barrels per day, implying a throughput capacity utilization of 95%. Refining cash operating expenses were $4.91 per barrel in the third quarter of 2023, higher than guidance of $4.70 per barrel primarily attributed to higher-than-expected energy prices. Renewable Diesel segment operating income was $123 million for the third quarter of 2023 compared to $212 million for the third quarter of 2022. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 3 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2023, which was 761,000 gallons per day higher than the third quarter of 2022. The higher sales volumes in the third quarter of 2023 were due to the impact of additional volumes from the DGD Port Arthur plant, which started up in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating income was lower than the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower renewable diesel margin in the third quarter of 2023. The ethanol segment reported $197 million of operating income for the third quarter of 2023 compared to $1 million for the third quarter of 2022. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.3 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2023, which was 831,000 gallons per day higher than the third quarter of 2022. Operating income was higher than the third quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of higher production volumes and lower corn prices in the third quarter of 2023. For the third quarter of 2023, G&A expenses were $250 million and net interest expense was $149 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $682 million and income tax expense was $813 million for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate was 23%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Included in this amount was a $33 million favorable change in working capital and $82 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities associated with the other joint venture member share of DGD. Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Regarding investing activities, we made $394 million of capital investments in the third quarter of 2023 of which $303 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and $91 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture members share of DGD capital investments attributable to Valero were $352 million in the third quarter of 2023. Moving to financing activities. We returned $2.2 billion to our stockholders in the third quarter of 2023 of which $360 million was paid as dividends and $1.8 billion was for the purchase of approximately 13 million shares of common stock resulting in a payout ratio of 68% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. This results in a year-to-date payout ratio of 58% as of September 30, 2023. With respect to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $9.2 billion of total debt, $2.3 billion of finance lease obligations and $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Debt to capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 17% as of September 30, 2023 and we ended the quarter well capitalized with $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Separately, as reported by Navigator last week, they cancelled their CO2 pipeline project. We still see carbon capture and storage as a strategic opportunity to reduce the carbon intensity of conventional ethanol, which would also qualify it as a feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel. Without carbon capture and storage, conventional ethanol does not have a pathway into staff under today's policies. We continue to evaluate other projects to sequester CO2. Turning to guidance. We still expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2023 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About $1.5 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and the balance to growth. For modelling our fourth quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.77 million to 1.82 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 445,000 to 465,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 470,000 to 490,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $4.60 per barrel. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2023. Operating expenses in 2023 should be $0.49 per gallon, which includes $0.19 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.4 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the fourth quarter, net interest expense should be about $145 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $690 million. For 2023, we expect G&A expenses to be approximately $925 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, please adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to 2 questions. If you have more than 2 questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Theresa Chen : I'd first like to ask about your outlook for near-term refining margins and specifically on the gasoline side. We've seen that significant volatility recently, especially early in October. What do you think explains the recent downside? And how does compare with demand across your footprint? Maybe going back to Lane's earlier comments on your wholesale system? And just generally, how do you think gasoline margins trend going forward? Gary Simmons : It's Gary. Yes, I think you had several factors that contributed to the sharp sell-out on gasoline. You kind of had the market view that hurricane season was over, you were approaching RVP transition. And then the DOE put out some fairly pessimistic demand numbers. And so all that kind of hit at once and caused a fairly significant sell-off in gasoline. In terms of the outlook going forward, we'd expect gasoline to kind of follow typical seasonal patterns, weaker cracks, kind of the fourth quarter and first quarter. The thing we're really looking at, as you know, the fundamental that looks good to us is the market structure still doesn't really support storing summer-grade gasoline, putting gasoline in New York Harbor for driving season next year. So as long as that's the case, our view would be that when you get to driving season next year, demand picks back up, you'll see cracks respond. Theresa Chen : Thank you. And on the crude oil side, in terms of light heavy differentials, given the heightened geopolitical risks in the Middle East and coupled with the incremental Venezuelan production following the recent sanctions relief and taking also into account the potential near-term start-up of just focus [ph]. How do you think about the impact of all these variables on light heavy differentials? And how this evolving from here? Gary Simmons : Yes. So really, the key driver on the light-heavy differentials continues to be the 4.5 million barrels a day that OPEC Plus has off the market. So we saw fairly tight differentials in the third quarter. They have moved wider despite the geopolitical issues that you've discussed. Some of that is just typical seasonal patterns. You've had less high sulfur fuel burn for power generation in the Middle East. So high sulfur fuel discounts widen some. We've seen some turnaround activity, especially in PADD 2 that pushed some heavy seller back on the market as differentials to widen out. Freight markets actually have a fairly significant impact on those differentials as well. So freight moving higher is causing the differentials to move. But we kind of see until the OPEC+ comes back on the market that you'll have narrower heavy sour differentials and they'll follow typical seasonal patterns. Operator : The next question is coming from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : This might be one question but in 2 parts, which I know you guys love. So it goes back to the gasoline comment, and it just seems like the market might be more seasonal than it had been in the past just because of the way consumers kind of travel and work. And then -- but at the same time, your system has gotten a little more diesel-oriented with the Port Arthur coker and Valero has a history of really strong sort of capture results and execution results in the fourth quarter when there's typically a lot of volatility and dislocations around all these markets. So the question is do you think that this kind of enhanced seasonality in gasoline is something we should get used to in future years? And in terms of your configuration and position within that, is it arguably better than it was sort of before you brought on some recent projects? Gary Simmons : Yes. So on the first part of the question in terms of even more seasonality around gasoline, I can't say that we're really seeing that. We did see sales throughout our whole system fall off a little bit after Labor Day but they've actually recovered quite nicely, and we're back into that 1 million barrels a day of sales. Gasoline sales year-over-year are up 2% in the current market from where they were last year at this time. Diesel sales are up a little stronger at 8% so I don't think it really is a seasonability factor that's impacting gasoline at least in the domestic markets. Lane Riggs : So to the second part, Sam. It's -- we really had a view since I want to say the 20 -- early '20 teens where we saw the diesel would be sort of the fuel of the future. If is the economic driver. So not only did we do the coker that you alluded to here recently. We also built a 2 big hydro cracker. We revamped the 2 big hydrocrackers, this is all in an effort to make our system more robust and its ability to move around and specifically be able to move towards making more and more distillate out of our assets. Operator : The next question is coming from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug Leggate : A couple of questions, if I may. I guess the first one is, I guess, about the Port Arthur Coker and more generally, what you're seeing going on and got the Gulf Coast as it relates to heavy or advantaged seller crude spreads? And I guess my point is, does Bocas, obviously, Loomis large [ph] in the horizon, but Maya seems to have behaved very differently from your indicator from WCS. And I realize that's largely your benchmark. So I'm just curious, are we seeing the capture rate from the coker that you anticipated? And what's your prognosis, I guess, for those advantaged crude spreads that are obviously a big factor in that project? Lane Riggs : I'm going to hand this off to Gary and Greg, I think, Gary, you might answer the heavy sour part and then Greg wanted to answer this capture rate on the coker. Gary Simmons : Yes. So we've seen heavy sour discounts widen back out. In Canada, they're back on apportionment on the pipeline. It looks like forecast for fairly robust production in Canada. You're seeing is welling back on the market. And then our view is, even when this focus does start up, it may take some eye off the market probably increases fuel yield from Mexico. And so that coker, we can use that as a feedstock as well. And I'll let Greg address the capture question. Greg Bram : Yes. And Doug, what I'd say about the cokers, it operated very well for the quarter, certainly consistent with our expectations. And so the project is generating good strong economic value, both by lowering feedstock, some of the things Gary is talking about and also enabling us to increase throughput. Doug Leggate : Sorry, guys, on gas broadcast, is that impacting spreads on the Gulf Coast materially? Gary Simmons : I don't think there's any impact today. Doug Leggate : Okay. My follow-up is a quick one maybe is for Jason. But another $1.8 billion of buybacks. You've now bought back, I think, about 15% of your shares in the last 1.5 years. You still got plenty of cash on the balance sheet, and we know this sector is notoriously seasonal. I'm just curious how we should think about your deployment or strategy of -- into seasonal periods when you get -- perhaps get more opportunistic? Jason Fraser : Yes. Thanks, Doug. Yes, it's okay. I'll talk about our approach to buybacks is driven by our thoughts around cash, the dividend debt. So I'll walk you through that and how we're looking about -- thinking about the rest of the year and then we can see -- more you won't be on that. So on cash, as you said, we ended the quarter at $5.8 billion. We've indicated mid target of $4 million [ph]. So we're very comfortable with us being in that current range now. On the debt side, we always practically look at our portfolio through a liability management lens on an ongoing basis, but we certainly don't have any needs to pay down any debt at this time. Net debt to cap as of September 30 was 17%. So it's a bit under our target range. So we're in good shape there. And on the dividend, we maintain a dividend is competitive, growing and sustainable through the cycle. And we feel like we're in a reasonable range now. I wouldn't want to get into more specific on timing or potential dividend increases at this time. And then that brings us to buyback and you know our post to buybacks is to have the annual target of 40% to 50% of adjusted net cash from operations, and we view the buyback as a flywheel supplementing our dividend to hit whatever our target is for the year. In the third quarter, we had a 68% payout year-to-date through the third quarter, we're at 58%. So I would say, under these conditions, even given the softer seasonality in the fourth quarter, you should definitely expect us to pay out over 50% for the year. And as you may recall, the pandemic, that was a fairly regular practice of 5 years before the pandemic, I think we averaged like a 57% payout. So in these periods where we have greatly above-average free cash generation, that will probably continue to be our practice. Doug Leggate : Clarification, Lane, if you don't mind, the fact you're already above 50%, the high end of your payout, does that preclude stepping into additional buybacks for the balance of this year? Jason Fraser : No, no, it does. We look at it on an annual basis, and I would think we'll be over 50% for the year. So it definitely does... Operator : The next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe could you talk through a little bit about what you're seeing in renewable diesel markets. 2Q margins were obviously quite soft indicators been weak. Can you talk -- was there any impact from hedging losses in the quarter and maybe could you help us if there were kind of a rough estimate of maybe what that was? And then can you just more broadly talk about what you're seeing in terms of supply demand in the marketplace impact of RIN pricing and RVO limitations, et cetera? Eric Fisher : Sure, Ryan, this is Eric. I think we saw the RIN prices drop pretty quickly kind of in that September and into October. And really, as you stare at that drop, it was kind of on the news that there was the anticipation of a couple of big start-ups at the end of the year that have now been delayed. It was also in the news that there was going to be with Russia freezing out its exports that it would force the U.S. to export more, therefore, drop the obligation. So the combination of all that news kind of caused a precipitous drop in the RINs kind of right at the end of the quarter and into the beginning of the fourth quarter. The real margin loss there is really because as fat prices have since adjusted in the spa [ph] market but obviously, there's a lag of our fat prices that kind of carried on that have since started to catch up with this drop in credit prices. But we'll see that continue to carry through, through the fourth quarter. But overall, I think that's really what we're seeing. The spot margin is cleaned back up. Fat prices continue to come off. You really see all of that being kind of a return to profitability here in the fourth quarter. So that's really what we see going on in the RD market. Ryan Todd : Okay. And then maybe switching on the refining side, as we think about PADD 5, it was really quite strong through third quarter on a relative basis across the country and into the early part of the fourth quarter. Can you talk maybe about what you're seeing overall in terms of kind of supply/demand in PADD 5 across your operations there? There's a lot of moving pieces with some refineries that are -- that have transitioned off the market from conversions right now. So how do you -- as you look forward on the next -- do you expect that market to stay relatively tight for the foreseeable future? And how do you think about it relative to your operations there? Gary Simmons : Ryan, this is Gary. I think our view of PADD 5 is that with the renewable diesel coming into the market, the market should be well supplied on the distillate side but it's going to be very tight on gasoline. You just don't have the gasoline production that you used to have with the refinery conversions. And so when one refinery goes down, it's going to create a lot of shortness in the market. Operator : The next question is coming from Manav Gupta of UBS. Manav Gupta : Guys, you are known for your capital discipline and you look at a lot of projects and in the end, very few actually make it through the funnel. We are somewhere in October. You guys haven't talked about a major project yet. And I'm just wondering if 2024 would then be more of a quick hit projects. I mean, coker has already come online. So when I look at 2024, should we think for the year where you could be doing more quick hit projects versus a mega project, which generally can go on for 3 to 4 years? Lane Riggs : This is Lane. So the way I would -- I agree with you, and that's -- we still believe we can -- we'll spend somewhere between $0.5 billion to $1 billion a year of strategic capital. But when you look at sort of what's the nature of those, certainly on the refining side, they are going to be shorter cash cycle types of projects instead of a big like a coker type project there'll be a series of small projects. And then when you further drill down and what do we look for? We look for refining projects to lower our cost to produce. We also like projects and improve our reliability and then, of course, we like to hold renewable line in terms of its ability for us to drop the carbon intensity of our fuels. And as you also said, we're very careful about our communication on projects. We'd like to be a little closer to FID or at FID before we really talk about them. Manav Gupta : Perfect. Just a quick follow-up. We have seen some sanction relief on the Venezuelan side. You were buying from Chevron even before that and Chevron had been giving the indications that they could ramp up over there. So can you help us understand like what kind of volume -- incremental volumes could come to the market from the Venezuelan side in probably next 2 or 3 years? Gary Simmons : Yes, this is Gary. So if you look, there's about 250,000 barrels a day of exports in Venezuela, most of that volume is going to the Far East. But with the lifting of sanctions, it has the potential to make its way to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Operator : The next question is coming from John Royall of JPMorgan. John Royall : So we've talked about coastal light heavy dips and how they've tightened up pretty significantly. Can you remind us how much flexibility you have in your system to run lights versus heavies versus mediums? Greg Bram : John, this is Greg. So we can flex quite a bit. What you'll tend to see us do is when the medium grades look attractive, we'll ramp that up and kind of back down to both the lights and the heavies conversely, when heavy sours get more attractive relative to the medium grades will ramp up the heavies. I don't remember the exact percentages. We can get those to you. I think they might actually be in our -- in IR deck yet. Page 30 there. But that tends to be what drives us to kind of swing between those different grades. John Royall : Great. And then maybe you can talk about the beat and utilizations in 3Q. You didn't call out anything in particular, but you're above the high end and I think every region, but one. It seems like the system ran quite well. Are there any moving pieces to call out maybe maintenance getting pushed out or anything of that sort or is it just better-than-expected operations? Lane Riggs : I would say we didn't -- the third quarter is always going to be a period where you don't have a lot of turn on activity. I mean some of it might leak over from the second or you might start a little bit going into the fourth. But system industry-wide, we're not unique in that sense. Most of your turnaround work is either done in the first and second or the fourth quarter. And so it should be a high utilization. And obviously, we've emphasized reliability got for the last, I don't know, more than a decade, we have the programs that we have. So you would expect us when we're not having turnarounds to have a pretty high level of utilization of our assets. Operator : The next question is coming from Joe Laetsch of Morgan Stanley. Joe Laetsch : So, I wanted to start on the diesel side. So you talked about gasoline cracks, but we hit so much [ph] which just remains really strong here. So I was just curious what your thoughts on the setup for diesel here into the winter. We have low inventories in both the U.S. and Europe and last year, we kind of had a similar level of tightness and were bailed out by a warmer winter. So just curious on your thoughts on the setup for diesel margins. Gary Simmons : Yes. So diesel demand remains very strong. I guess I mentioned diesel sales in our system are up about 8% year-over-year. Our view of the broader markets is that diesel demand in the U.S. is probably down about 1% year-to-date from where it was last year, and that's mainly due to the warmer winter we had last year. Our guys' estimate, we lost about 125,000 barrels a day of diesel demand due to the warmer weather. So inventories remain below the 5-year average level, demand remains good. So you're heading into winter with low inventories, and we would expect strong diesel cracks through the winter and could get very strong if we have a colder winter. Joe Laetsch : And then shifting gears a little bit. So you've talked a little bit about RD margins being pressured here. So I was just hoping you could touch on some of the regional dynamics that you're seeing and economics of selling into other states in the Coast or potentially Canada to offset in the lower LCFS prices that we've seen in California? Lane Riggs : Yes, we absolutely see. California has become kind of the ore of the RD market. We see more opportunity in Oregon, Washington and Canada as kind of the growth opportunities. And so we absolutely look to maximize our product sales into those markets. California continues to talk about the obligation for 2030. They sort of pushed off a lot of their -- they're still doing a lot of their conferences and workshops on that. We still fully expect that at some point, they are going to announce the changes to be effective sometime next year, and that will increase the LCFS price in California. So -- but in the meantime, we continue to look at -- again, you kind of mentioned that. We still have the advantages being on the Gulf Coast. Do you have access to all of the global feedstocks. You have access to all the global markets so it gives us a lot of capability to go to different markets. And we continue to see waste oils advantaged versus vegetable oils from a CI standpoint. So you look at that low-cost producer on the Gulf Coast, that just continues to be kind of the winning formula for being able to have flexibility to go to different markets in the RD space [ph]. Operator : The next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Lane, first question is for you is just -- it's been a couple of months since you stepped to the job as CEO. Just would love your perspective on early observations, recognizing the strategy has been very consistent and steady for a long time, and you've been a big part of it. But early observations as the new leader of the organization and key strategic priorities that we haven't really talked about here on the call thus far. Lane Riggs : It\u2019s been a couple of years, Neil. I'm just -- but it's been great. You always got to remember, I was an integral part of really Joe's team really from the beginning of his [indiscernible] you've mentioned, it's been a very successful one. So are there things that I'm trying to do maybe a little bit differently, I'd say I put my thumb on the scale for issues maybe a little bit and maybe unweighted others. But largely speaking, our strategy is the same because it was successful and it's currently successful. I don't know that I have any real plans to deviate from that. Obviously, the world can change and we respond accordingly. But the world looks at least -- this business looks a whole life like it did a year ago. So our outlook is pretty much unchanged. Neil Mehta : Now that's -- we definitely see the consistency. The second question is -- it's a very -- it's a smaller part of your business, but it's always -- you can create volatility in earnings is ethanol. Just you're curious on your outlook for that business and -- what -- how far away are we from mid-cycle as you think about it? Lane Riggs : Yes. The ethanol obviously has had a good year this year with lower corn prices and low natural gas prices. So the ethanol margins have been, I would say, higher than what we would call a mid-cycle but it's not really exceptionally higher than mid-cycle. It's actually been fairly strong. But I would say, looking back historically, ethanol is always kind of a steady drumbeat business. We do see that the biggest opportunity here is still this low-carbon opportunity and some of the growth in other markets in the world. Again, we are 30% of the export capability of ethanol for the U.S. And so we see this interest in the world, lowering its carbon footprint by increasing its ethanol blending. So Canada, has become an E10 country almost overnight. There's talk about that going to E15 next year. We're seeing other countries that are starting to look at incremental ethanol blending. And then there's a lot of interest in ethanol as a feedstock into chemicals and solvents and paints. And so I think we still see a lot of good opportunities for ethanol globally that I think will keep us in a very strong margin environment. And then obviously, I mean, so much of that depends on weather, ultimately. I mean, obviously, no one can control that. But the U.S. is a big ag country. We have a lot of capability to grow a lot of corn. And so as long as that holds up, then I think ethanol has got a good outlook. Operator : The next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Two, hopefully, the quick question. First, maybe either is for Lane or Gary. Look like at branding economic why now is really good. With the wind -- if we're looking at your system, what is the incremental percentage of the gasoline supply will increase as a result of those branding for you versus less quarter third quarter the level over the fourth quarter last year, whatever is the comparison you want to use? And secondly, that I want to see what is -- if you can you give us any color that how's the turnaround cycle look like for you next year and whether that compared to this year, going to be about the same, lighter, heavier also? And also that whether you think the industry is going to have a normal cycle next year after the catch up this year or that the catch-up is going to continue into next year? Gary Simmons : So if I understand correctly, the first was how much really does the gasoline pool well as you go to higher RVP gasoline. Is that what you were asking, Paul? Paul Cheng : Yes. I mean that every year that when we go to the wind grade, obviously, you see more branding, but that with the economics of light is actually very active for the branding. And I assume that given the winter grade, it will also allow you to have more flexibility than your brand the strict late into the system and it looks like it's very economic also. Greg Bram : Yes, Paul, this is Greg. So you're right. You definitely increase the amount of primarily butane that you blend into the gasoline. It ranges depending on which region ring and the change in specs, it's in the 5% to 10% range. And then you're right that to the extent that butane has a higher octane than the pool, it does allow you to put more of the lower octane component into the blend [indiscernible] one of those right now that looks pretty attractive. Paul Cheng : Sorry. Please go ahead. Lane Riggs : No, I was just going to answer you -- I think it was your same question around turnarounds. We sort of have a policy for a while that we don't give any real outlook on our turnaround or the industry turnaround behavior. So. Paul Cheng : And if I can just go back into the earlier question about -- great answer. Any kind of, say, because that when it is more economic, it tends to brand more, but on the other hand, gasoline is not great right now. So I'm trying to understand that how the 2 years going to be impacting in your thinking or your accident here. Lane Riggs : I think -- if I understand, Paul, back to winter blending. Obviously, [indiscernible], butane is relatively cheap. And we always look at economic signals to try to determine how much gasoline are produced and that compares to sort of the reformulated grade, they might require less butane. And then there are specs that you hit, I mean you would think you would get near 10% in butane in full, but a lot of times we hit other specifications and the finished gasoline besides RVP. And so I mean, it's a fair. Operator : The next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : I wanted to first go back to uses of cash or returns of cash, I should say. And I know Valero has a 40% to 50% payout ratio. It seems like you're returning a majority of the excess cash post dividends via buyback, maybe 2/3 of that excess cash. Is that kind of how we should think about return of cash moving forward essentially all of the excess cash or the majority of it beyond what you pay out in the dividend is going to be going towards the buyback for the foreseeable future. And I think some color around that could help the market bring some of that potential future buyback value forward? And I have a follow-up. Lane Riggs : Jason, this is Lane. Look -- directionally correct, but we still have to -- some of our cash obviously goes to sustaining our asset. So that's something that we're committed to. So we want to make sure that we're, a, that we are -- we had the earnings potential, our assets stay in a posture that we can always generate the right earnings with the market conditions and second, we maintain the dividend. And then we do believe we still have this sort of $0.5 billion to $1 billion of strategic capital in all that's done, all the excess cash will go to buybacks. Jason Gabelman : All right, great. And my second one is kind of on the strategic growth outlook. We've seen some of your larger peers use equity to buy up comped recently? And if I think about some of the potential areas you could expand into like chems, like low carbon fuels, those valuations have come down relative to where Valero trades. I don't know Valero doesn't typically use the equity to acquire other companies. But given what's going on with Navigator Pipeline and looking at your potential future growth opportunities, are you taking a closer look at strategic M&A and using equity given your stock and refiners in general have held up pretty well relative to other potential step-out opportunities? Lane Riggs : This is Lane again. I would say that we look at all these opportunities and all the business lines that I alluded earlier. And we have an entire group, our innovation group that's constantly looking at how can we bolt on and leverage our existing footprint, which, obviously, we have a big footprint in ethanol, we have a pretty big footprint renewable diesel. And we're also looking at everything else. Everything is on the table. We're always looking at it, but we are also very careful in terms of how we talk about it and how we're going to announce things. In terms of how we finance it, it's just a matter of when we -- as the world evolves, we'll come up with the best way that we think to finance something. But obviously, all these things have to go through sort of our investment gated process. Operator : The next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Maybe to follow up on Mr. Gabelman's question there. If we think about acquisitions, latest news says CITGO is potentially going to be on the [indiscernible] beginning of next year. So just curious how you think about greater footprint within refining as any kind of a possibility. Lane Riggs : So Roger, this is Lane. So as you know our history, we were a big consolidator in the industry going back to 2000. That to really our last major acquisition was sort of circa 2013. That's when our base became somewhat like it looks today. So we understand probably as well as any operator out there would it take to buy something or to merge something and get it on our system and all the costs associated with it. And we always get everything that we think within reason. I mean we always analyze everything and -- we haven't bought anything like I said, since 2013 on any refining assets. You never say never. We look at everything, and we'll again, like I alluded to on Jason's question, we'll run it through our processes and figure out where there anything that makes sense for us or not. Roger Read : Yes. I'd imagine the data. Lane Riggs : Clear on that, Roger. They got to compete with everything else, including buyback, right? So. Roger Read : Right, right. No. I mean the data room is going to have to be interesting at a minimum. Second question I have, it's unrelated, but kind of a follow-up on some of the things going on the renewable fuel side. We've seen a lot of downward moves or we saw a strong downward move, I should say, in the D4, D6 RINs kind of latter part of Q3 and the early part of Q4. It looks like the market is more or less sort of adjusting to that on some of the feedstock and other issues. But I was just curious if you all have any read-throughs on what cause that decline and whether or not this decline sort of reflects current situation? Or is there more downside risk to RINs given the mandate versus production numbers and obviously an increasing volume of renewable diesel coming in '24 from the industry? Lane Riggs : Yes. I think as I mentioned before, there's this kind of constant talk about oncoming production, increased rates, Arthurs [ph] projects that has always said at some point the D4 is going to be under pressure especially since the EPA did not raise the D4 obligation in their last set rule. So I think though, is -- and then we combine that with there is this kind of a rush, I think, look like to me kind of a rush to sell RINs in the third quarter with that narrative, combined with that Russian announcement that they were going to ban exports, which kind of quickly evaporated. So there's, I think, a kind of a more of a temporary view that the D4 [ph] was going to drop even more. And like you've observed, it's kind of recovered and fat prices have also since adjusted. We could see that biodiesel and veg oil RD is negative now. That's one of the things we've always said is that the lower CI waste oil play was always going to be more advantageous. So even at these lower credit values, we're still the advantage platform. So as you go into 2024, obviously, obligations already set. It's hard to tell exactly where that's going to go. There's no doubt that R&D will continue to grow. We do see that for us, you're going to see R&D continue to grow, as we talked before, Canada is a big outlet, which takes a lot of this RIN exposure away and then you also obviously have the SAP project come on, where we'll diversify into a different market. And so -- and then and if for some reason, SAP doesn't work, that product also meets Arctic diesel grades that again, go to Nordic countries and Canada. So there's no doubt that there's going to be a continued pressure on the RINs for both the D4 and D6 but our strategy has always been -- there's other markets that you can minimize the impact of that. And then with our platform, we're still the most advantaged from a cost and CI standpoint. Roger Read : I appreciate that coastal advantage as always. Operator : Our last question for today is coming from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew Blair : Circling back to the R&D margins in Q3, are you able to quantify the impact from DGD to fire on the reported $0.65 gallon EBITDA margin? Lane Riggs : No, we usually don't give that kind of detail. I would say it wasn't large, just [indiscernible] at that. Matthew Blair : Sounds good. And then on the refining side, could you talk about your product exports in Q3 and so far into Q4? And do you expect any negative impact from this announcement from Mexico a couple of days that you're looking to restrict refined product imports into the country? Gary Simmons : Yes, I'll take the first part of it and then let Rich Walsh handle the second part. Yes, our exports, if you look at the exports in the third quarter, we did 389,000 barrels a day, 281 a distillate, 108 of gasoline. Based on second quarter, the volumes are up based on historic numbers, they trended up as well to our typical export locations. Most of the line went to Latin America, about 70% of the diesel in Latin America and about 30% to Europe. And those are remaining at those levels as we move into the fourth quarter. Richard Walsh : This is Rich. I'll just answer the second half of it. On this decree an issue, it's actually rightly aimed at import smuggling that's going on. So you have individuals that are trying to bring product gasoline diesel into Mexico, but describing it as something that has a lower tariff like a tariff, something like that and importing it in. And that's resulting in them getting a lower tariff. So this decree is really focused in on that. For Valero, we're properly importing all of our gasoline and products, and we're paying the full and proper tariff for it. So -- and then also all of our fuel comes out of our own system, and it's all high-quality meet suspect [ph]. So we have a lot of interaction with the Mexican authorities. They're aware of the legitimacy of our operation. And so we don't expect this initiative to be an issue for us. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Bhullar for closing comments. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Donna. I appreciate everyone joining us today. And as always, if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the IR team on the call. Thanks again, and everyone have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance. Thank you. You may begin. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With me today are Lane Riggs, our CEO and President; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and COO; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted financial metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our earnings release and filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Lane for opening remarks. Lane Riggs : Thank you, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. With the exception of our 2022 results, we delivered the highest fourth quarter and full year adjusted earnings in company's history in 2023, demonstrating the earnings capability of our portfolio. Our refining system achieved 97.4% mechanical availability in 2023, which is our best ever. We also set a record for environmental performance and matched our previous record for process safety, illustrating the benefits from our longstanding commitment to safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operations.  Now through organic growth of our wholesale system, we set an annual record for sales volume in 2023 at approximately 1 million barrels per day, demonstrating the strength of our branded and wholesale marketing network. We continue to pursue strategic projects that enhance the earnings capability of our business and expand our long-term competitive advantage. The DGD Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF project at Port Arthur remains on schedule to completion expected in the first quarter of 2025 for a total of $315 million. Half of that attributable to Valero. With the completion of this project, DGD is expected to become one of the largest manufacturers of SAF in the world. In addition, we are pursuing shorter cash cycle projects that optimize and capitalize on opportunities to improve margins around our existing refining assets.  On the financial side, we continue to honor our commitment to shareholders. We returned 73% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the fourth quarter, resulting a 60% payout ratio for 2023, and last week, our Board approved a 5% increase in the quarterly cash dividend. Looking ahead, we expect refining margins to remain supported by tight product supply and demand balances. In the near term, product inventories ahead of the summer driving season are expected to be constrained with heavy industry-wide turnaround activity in the first quarter, providing support to refining margins. Long term, we expect global demand growth to exceed products applied despite new refinery startups. In closing, our team's simple strategy of pursuing excellence in operations, return-driven discipline on growth projects and a demonstrated commitment to shareholder returns has driven our success and positions us well for the future. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Lane. For the fourth quarter of 2023, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.2 billion or $3.55 per share compared to $3.1 billion or $8.15 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2022 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $3.2 billion or $8.45 per share.  For 2023, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $8.8 billion or $24.92 per share compared to $11.5 billion or $29.04 per share in 2022. 2023 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $8.8 billion or $24.90 per share compared to $11.6 billion or $29.16 per share in 2022. The refining segment reported $1.6 billion of operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $4.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. Refining throughput volumes in the fourth quarter of 2023 averaged 3 million barrels per day. Throughput capacity utilization was 94% in the fourth quarter of 2023.  Refining cash operating expenses were $4.99 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2023, higher than guidance of $4.60 primarily due to an environmental regulatory reserve adjustment in the West Coast. Renewable Diesel segment operating income was $84 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $261 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Renewable Diesel sales volumes averaged 3.8 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was 1.3 million gallons per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. The higher sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2023 were due to the impact of additional volumes from the DGD Port Arthur plant, which started up in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating income was lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 due to lower renewable diesel margin in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Ethanol segment reported $190 million of operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating income was $205 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $69 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.5 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was 448,000 gallons per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2022.  Adjusted operating income was higher than the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of higher production volumes and lower corn prices in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, G&A expenses were $295 million, and net interest expense was $149 million. G&A expenses were $998 million in 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense was $690 million and income tax expense was $331 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate was 22% for 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Included in this amount was a $631 million unfavorable impact from working capital and $65 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities associated with the other joint venture member share of DGD. Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was $9.2 billion. Included in this amount was a $2.3 billion unfavorable impact from working capital and $512 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities associated with the other joint venture member's share of DGD. Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was $11 billion.  Regarding investing activities, we made $540 million of capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2023, of which $460 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and the balance was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member share of DGD, capital investments attributable to Valero were $506 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.8 billion for 2023. Moving to financing activities. We returned $1.3 billion to our stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2023 of which $346 million was paid as dividends and $966 million was for the purchase of approximately 7.5 million shares of common stock, resulting in a payout ratio of 73% for the quarter. As Lane mentioned, this results in a payout ratio of 60% for the year. Through share repurchases, we reduced our share count by approximately 11% in 2023 and by 19% since year-end 2021.  With respect to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $9.2 billion of total debt, $2.3 billion of finance lease obligations and $5.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 18% as of December 31, 2023. And we ended the quarter well capitalized with $5.3 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2024 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts, regulatory compliance and joint venture investments. About $1.6 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and the balance to growth with approximately half of the growth capital towards our low carbon fuel businesses and half towards refining projects. Our low carbon fuels growth capital is primarily for the SAF project. Our refining growth projects aim to increase our crude flexibility in the Gulf Coast extract more value out of some of our conversion unit capacity, improve our access to some key product markets and improve our logistics into or out of our refineries. All of these projects meet or exceed our minimum return threshold of 25% after-tax IRR. For modelling our first quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.52 million to 1.57 million barrels per day which includes turnaround work on the legacy coker at our Port Arthur refinery. Mid-Continent at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day West Coast at 235,000 to 255,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 435,000 to 455,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $5.10 per barrel, reflecting lower throughput due to turnaround activity across our system. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2024. Operating expenses in 2024 should be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.18 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.5 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about 150 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately 700 million. For 2024, we expect G&A expenses to be approximately 975 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, please adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from John Royall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Royall : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. So my first question is on the macro side, just on light heavies. LLS-Maya has risen all the way to around $10 from about 6 beginning in the quarter, yet we still have OPEC being restrictive in terms of production. Can you talk about the drivers of the widening of coastal heavy diffs and how you see them progressing from here? Gary Simmons : Sure. This is Gary. I think a number of factors contributed to that. You did see production in Western Canada tick up a little bit in the fourth quarter. We're seeing a few more Venezuelan barrels make their way into the U.S. Gulf Coast. So a little more supply on the market. But probably the biggest factor is as you got late in the fourth quarter and early this quarter, you're starting to see the impact of turnarounds decreasing demand for some of those, especially the heavy sour barrels. In addition to those factors, you had the typical seasonality in high sulfur fuel oil, but lower high sulfur fuel demand for power generation kind of weighing on the heavy sour discounts as well. So our view is that through the first quarter, through refinery maintenance season, you'll continue to see a little bit wider heavy sour discounts, but then you'll start to see those come in and really for any meaningful impact to sustainable impact for the quality diffs we need more OPEC production on the market. If you look at the consultant forecast, it looks like that could happen probably third quarter this year. John Royall : Great. Thanks, Gary. And then my second question is on return of capital. So your number for the quarter was very strong, and you finished the year at 60% of CFO. I know you've talked about how you tend to come in above the range when cracks are strong. If '24 ends up being kind of more of a mid-cycle type year or even below, how should we think about where you might fall in that 40% to 50% range this year? Jason Fraser : Good morning. This is Jason. And I've got a bit of a cold. And if I talk too much, I'll go into a coughing fits. So I'm going to ask Homer to respond. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Jason. Yes, John, I mean our approach to shareholder returns is driven by our annual target of 40% to 50% of adjusted net cash from operations. And obviously, that includes the dividend, which we consider non-discretionary and buybacks, which are considered the flywheel supplementing our dividend to hit our target. And given the strength in our balance sheet in the fourth quarter, as we highlighted, we had a 73% payout which resulted in a 60% payout for the year. And as you touched on, since 2014, we've regularly paid above our target. And in fact, the average payout for the 5 years leading into COVID was around 57%. So I think in short and periods when the balance sheet is strong as it is now and sustaining CapEx, the dividend and strategic CapEx is covered. You can reasonably think of our 40% to 50% target as a floor and expect any excess cash to go towards buybacks. John Royall : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : Good morning. Would you mind giving us an update on your clean products supply and demand outlook from here? Taking into account the recent inventory moves as well as the additional refining capacity ramping up internationally, some utilization even is not fully running and what you're also seeing in terms of demand across your footprint, please? Gary Simmons : Sure, Theresa. This is Gary. It's always difficult to assess the markets this early, kind of the holidays and weather tend to have a big impact on-road transportation fuel demand and then fog in the Gulf kind of tends to limit exports. But domestically, I can tell you, demand for gasoline appears to be following typical seasonal patterns. It looks normal for this time of year and in line with where we were last year, I will tell you, gasoline volumes through our wholesale channel of trade are down, a few percent year-over-year. We're not really concerned about that because you can see it's in regions that were really impacted by weather. And as the weather we're starting to see the volumes recover nicely. European gasoline markets are relatively strong. That's kept the transatlantic arb closed, and then market structure doesn't really incentivize making summer great gasoline and putting it into storage. Gasoline exports into Mexico and Latin America have remained steady. So all of this really has us pretty optimistic on gasoline cracks once we move into spring and gasoline demand improves with driving season. On the diesel side, demand in our system is up about 7% compared to last year. Probably seeing more heating oil demand with a little bit colder weather. Diesel inventory remains at the bottom of the 5-year average range. So good demand combined with low inventory continues to support the diesel cracks. Diesel exports in our system were down a little in the fourth quarter. The Russian barrels making their way into South America have caused some changes in trade flow with more of our barrels going to Europe. In Europe, warm weather tended to keep their demand down a little bit. But I can tell you thus far in the first quarter, we're seeing much stronger European demand with the colder weather hitting there. We believe the diesel cracks continue to get support from increased jet demand. As kerosene gets pulled out of the diesel pool as we continue to recover from COVID. Jet demand last year was still down about 10.5% from pre-COVID levels. Most forecasts show us closing about half that gap this year. And then expectations for a little better for diesel demand with slightly colder weather and freight picking back up as well. So overall, back to your question on new capacity, it looks like to us somewhere about 1.5 million barrels a day of new capacity coming online, year-over-year growth in demand looks to be slightly over 1 million barrels a day. So supply/demand balances are really fairly close to what we saw last year. The question really becomes timing of when that new capacity comes on. Our view is that it will take longer for those new refineries to start up and you don't really see an impact on supply until later in the year. And if that holds, then you have relatively tight supply-demand balances was really the only difference being we're starting from a different inventory position, as you've already mentioned. In our mind on that, we do expect to see inventory draws over the next several weeks. The cold weather had some impact on refinery operations, and then you'll start to get into turnaround season, which we would expect total light product inventory to begin to draw. Theresa Chen : Thank you for that detailed answer. And then maybe just looking within the U.S., what are your views on the divergence in product margins across regions? What do you think is causing the weakness in benchmark cracks in the Mid-Con particular just suppose with the strength in the Gulf Coast? Gary Simmons : Yes. So historically, we've seen that the Mid-Con is short product in the summer and long product in the winter. And I think we're seeing that this year. The market is just long and especially the weathers tended to hit that region more and so we see demand off in that region. But I think once you start to see the weather clear and you get back into driving season, the Mid-Continental recover. Seeing the same thing kind of on the West Coast, weathers tended to impact demand on the West Coast. And so we've seen that market a little bit softer than maybe you would typically see for this time of year. Theresa Chen : Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Yes. Congrats on great results. And one of the things that stood out to us was the capture rates continue to be very good. And I recognize some of that is operational performance, but some of that's commercial and Lane guaranteed, I know there's some sensitivities around that, but a lot of your competitors spend a lot of time talking about what they're doing on the commercial side. So just be curious, if anything you can share about how you're optimizing what continues to be a very dynamic environment. Lane Riggs : Hey, Neil, it's Lane. So I'm not going to, you know, I'll start by saying thank you. And I will say that, you know, I wouldn't trade our commercial team for any other team in the industry. I sort of spoke about this in the past. You know, everyone in our company understands the position they play. I think sometimes some, I've been in organizations where that's not really clear and you can get a lot of interference running between the supply chain. That's not true at Valero. Everybody has a position they play and they understand how to do it well. Refining focuses on reliability and operating. Envelopes and expenses, our P&E coordinates between the groups that make the signals, and our refining commercial groups execute the signals. And it's pretty clear on how all that's supposed to work. And so I would tell you that that's really the key to our execution. And, of course, finally, everybody in the corporation is incentivized with the same goals. We don't have different groups having their own sort of incentives. So that's how we get alignment all the way through. So glad to have them. Neil Mehta : Yeah, no, it shows up. So thank you. Then the follow-up just on North Atlantic, it was particularly strong this quarter relative to the benchmark. You know, the benchmark, I think, was $16, and the realized gross margin was well above that. So just curious if there's anything you'd call out in Montreal or UK that drove the strength there. Greg Bram : Hey, Neil, this is Greg. So we saw accrued costs improve in that region, primarily in Cannes, where you saw that occur more than you did in Pembroke. And then you brought up commercial margins. They were very strong for the quarter as well for that region. And then some of the compliance costs for the programs over there, costs were lower than we've seen in prior periods. And all those things combined to drive up that capture rate in the North Atlantic. Gary Simmons : Yeah, and I'll just add, you know, Syncrude trading at $7 below Brent, you know, and a discount to that to Brent with a high distillate yield crude is a real benefit to our system. Neil Mehta : Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks, guys. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm not sure who wants to take this one, Lane, but I want to ask perhaps an obvious question about shipping disruptions and what it means for perhaps not Valero specifically, but just in a more macro sense. How do, you know, the situation with the Red Sea bidding up clean tanker rates and so on, what does that do to the movement of product and the implications for a system which is perhaps more dependent on imports than it has been at any time, at least since I've covered this sector? Gary Simmons : Yeah, so, you know, we're not really running crude from that region, so it hasn't really had an impact to us in terms of supply of crude. But the big impact, especially on the crude side of the business, has just been freight rates. You know, we had a period of time where you could export from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Northwest Europe crude, you know, in the low $2 a barrel range. That spiked to $6 a barrel. And you could see that in Brent TI. So, you know, I would tell you probably for our system, net is an advantage because it gives us a crude cost advantage versus our global competitors. Doug Leggate : Okay. I realize it's kind of hard to quantify, so we'll continue to watch, but thanks for that answer. Lane, my follow-up is for you or maybe for Jason, given it's cold, but 40% to 50% payout, it seems that, at least on our numbers, you are easily able to sustain the payout at the higher level, especially now that you've restated your $2 billion CapEx plan. So I'm just curious, what's the reficient [ph] to kind of reset that range that your system clearly is capable of supporting in terms of the payout? Lane Riggs : I'm going to let Homer answer that. Homer Bhullar : Hey, Doug. I mean, I think obviously our target is set on a long-term range, right? And so the 40% to 50% think of it as like a long-term target. But to your point, and as I mentioned earlier, we've consistently come in above that. And, again, I think when you have a strong balance sheet as it is right now, we're not going to build cash. So I think you should reasonably expect shareholder returns to come in above that target. Doug Leggate : That's what we expect. Thanks so much. I appreciate you taking my questions, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Manav Gupta of UBS. Please go ahead. Manav Gupta : So I wanted to ask about the renewable diesel side of the business. The capture on the DJD dropped to about 49%. And now Homer has done a very good job of explaining to the market how the lag works. So if we add back that lag effect and that 64%, the actual capture would have hit something like 93%. So when we look past 4Q, the margin is up materially. And if we assume an 80%, 90% capture, ignoring the lag, would that imply that first quarter in terms of renewable diesel margin would be much stronger than the earnings that came for the fourth quarter? Eric Fisher : Hey, Manav. This is Eric, and I would just say yes. Yeah, that's a very good \u2013 yeah, we see a lot of the same curve that you described. And really the change for renewable diesel for Valero is with the first full year of DJD3 in operation, we run a lot higher percentage of foreign feedstocks, and that supply chain is just naturally longer. So the most attractive, lowest CIA feedstocks are coming from foreign imports, and I think that's creating this longer lag than we've seen in DJD historically. So your analysis, I think, is correct. Manav Gupta : Perfect. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up here is last year we had an abnormally warm winter. Now when we look at this first quarter, as you guys have mentioned, industry is taking a heavier turnaround versus last year, and then you could have a much colder weather out, as we are all seeing there. So year-on-year comp for the first quarter, again, could be better than even last year. I'm just trying to understand the dynamics versus last year versus this as it relates to the heating oil demand. Gary Simmons : Yeah, that's kind of the way we see it. The big difference between last year and this year is we had the winter storm early in the quarter last year, which took refining capacity offline and kind of created the big inventory reset. You didn't have that this year, but then in our mind you'll see more of a draw as we get into February and March with the turnaround activity and a little colder weather. Lane Riggs : And it's January. So we still have the possibility of cold weather hitting the Gulf Coast. Manav Gupta : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Sam Margolin of Wolf Research. Please go ahead. Sam Margolin : Hi. Morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Gary Simmons : Good morning. Sam Margolin : I had a question on the gasoline market. You know, I think capture rate in 4Q may have benefited from butane economics, and so correspondingly if there was a high incentive to blend as much winter grade as possible, there may have been a low incentive to make and store summer grade, and there's just a lot of NGL supply that is kind of making its way into stockpiles across a number of categories. And so I want to know if it makes sense to think about, you know, as we enter into driving season, if total gasoline inventories are maybe overstated, just given the quantity of, you know, maybe butane in that number. Gary Simmons : Yeah, certainly in our system when you look at the cost to produce of a summer grade of gasoline, there's no economics at all to be making summer grade gasoline and putting it into storage. You know, I think the only people that could be storing barrels at all, it would be high octane components, and they're really just, you know, speculating that octane is going to get stronger. But we certainly see it that way, that the barrels that are in storage today are largely winter grade. Sam Margolin : Great. And thanks. My non-follow-up second question is about SAF. And, you know, I'm just wondering how that market is developing for you commercially, you know, as we get closer to the SAF unit coming on. I think there's a view that, you know, the SAF market could take on some, you know, contracted, you know, longer term kind of cost plus characteristics because airlines have levers to pass it through that are sort of outside of the policy regime. But would love your thoughts on how commercially SAF is developing as you get closer to production. Eric Fisher : Yeah, Sam, I think you've said it well. We continue to talk to all the airlines and cargo carriers. A lot of their models are going to be based on more of a voluntary approach in sort of a jet plus basis that goes into a pass through to customers that want to offset their carbon footprint through their travel, you know, through their travel budgets. And so we continue to have a lot of those conversations. I think we're very close on having several contracts done with airlines going into our early production from our project. So that continues to be progressing very, very well. So we don't see that we're going to have a problem moving all of the volume out of this project. Sam Margolin : Awesome. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Paul Sansky of Sansky Research. Please go ahead. Paul Sansky : Morning all. I was going to ask about international shipping, but you've dealt with the Red Sea. So could you just talk a bit about Russia? There was big headlines about a port explosion there. I was wondering how much distillate and other product you're seeing coming out of Russia as we start the year. Secondly, I think you've benefited a lot from Venezuelan, incremental Venezuelan crude. What's your outlook there? And then finally, what are you seeing from Mexico with the new big refinery starting and Nigeria maybe with the refinery starting? Thanks. Gary Simmons : Okay. Yeah, I'll start with Russia. I think, you know, the drone attack that occurred last night, you know, probably the biggest market impact we're seeing so far is you've seen a reaction in the naphtha market. That refinery supplied a lot of naphtha to the Far East, and so there's concern that that flow may be gone, and so the naphtha market's tightened up. I think you do see distillates starting to fall, you know, and some of what we're seeing is that, you know, as the refineries experience some issues, they're having trouble getting support from the West that they typically would, even for things like, you know, spare parts and those types of things. So, you know, we do see that maybe distillate starts to trend off a little bit due to those issues. The middle part of the question was? Paul Sansky : Venezuela. Venezuela. Gary Simmons : Okay, yeah. So we continue to ramp up our volume of Venezuelan crude. I think, you know, the lifting of sanctions more than additional volume into our system probably had more of a price impact, you know, so we did see a little bit more value in the fourth quarter on the Venezuelan barrels that were running as a result of, you know, further reducing some of the sanctions that they have on Venezuela. Paul Sansky : Mexico refineries, though. Gary Simmons : Yeah, so we're not seeing any impact as of yet from the Mexico refineries. You know, when we talk about crude supply, there's always the discussion that, you know, we may see some fall off in our supply of Maya, but that really hasn't impacted us yet. And we don't see any delta on the product side of the business yet either. Paul Sankey : And I guess that would then apply to Nigeria as well, right? Gary Simmons : Yes, same thing. We think in our mind, it's going to take a while for that refinery to ramp up. It's just a big refinery that's not going to be easy to bring online. Paul Sankey : Great. And then just a follow-up second question here, Homer. Lane, you said that you don't anticipate the asset base changing greatly with the change that we saw last year in CEO with you taking the leadership. Can you just update us, given the number of assets that are on the market? And perhaps if you want to add anything on California where results look weak for the quarter, and you've expressed dismay policies there? Thanks, I'll leave it there. Thanks. Lane Riggs : Yes. I mean Joe has been pretty consistent as a leadership team, we've been pretty consistent. We look at everything that comes on to the market. I think structurally, our view really is whether it's policies in Europe and Canada and the United States in terms of the desire to try to move away from fossil fuels, the difficulty of -- and the difficulty is to make investments, we sort of see transportation fuels being structurally short. So we do look through that lens when we look at assets that come on. We also start during the 2000s, we were the biggest consolidator in the industry. So we know what it takes to do this, and we're very good at it. And so we -- our eyes are wide open when we look at all these assets and they come on and we understand the full cost and we compare that with organic growth and we compare that to buying back shares. And so it's all in that same framework. We do like our asset base. Clearly, California is a tough place to operate and probably getting tougher. So that's really all I want to say about that part. But what I also want to say is, we're not -- again, we look at everything and we look at -- we continue to look at refineries as well. Operator : The next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read : Yes. Good morning. I'd like to follow up, Gary, with you on the summer grade gasoline? Like I know you said what's in the inventories isn't that much. But what are the incentives look like at this point? Or are we so close to the conversion in March that the seasonality of gasoline is already set up that way? I'm just trying to understand what -- how the market is going to thread the needle between heavy maintenance and the current conditions in the market? Gary Simmons : Yes. So our view, Roger, you look and there's about $0.10 a carry to the March/April screen. We would tell you the cost to produce with butane being cheap is closer to $0.20, so certainly, no economic incentive at all the store gasoline. A lot of what we think happened in terms of the inventory build is that, you had a lot of things happened in December, especially in the Gulf Coast. Colonial was allocated the economics to ship on Explorer into the Mid-Continent, that arb was closed due to the Mid-Continent being weak. You had some Jones Act freight off the market in dry dock that limited some movements there. And then a lot of volatility in the freight markets really impacted exports late. And so what you saw is Gulf Coast inventories draw and in our mind, the Gulf Coast basis got weak enough that although there wasn't carry on the screen to keep gasoline inventory, I think we saw a lot of refiners choosing to hold inventory just because the U.S. Gulf Coast basis was so weak and they choose to store barrels that they would go ahead and then consume during their own maintenance periods rather than going out and covering and saw better value to do that. So if that's the case, then you should see this inventory work off over the next couple of months. Roger Read : Great. That's helpful. And then the other thing, obviously, in renewable diesel, dealing with some feedstock issues this quarter, but also there's a lot of new capacity coming in. Just curious how you look at or how you would ask us to think about margin potential in this business, sort of assuming either forward curve at this point or just where we are today in terms of market structure, if it holds, how we should think about the moving pieces here because it's -- it's a little more opaque to us, the feedstocks coming in and the timing of that relative to just matching in the market on a daily basis? Eric Fisher : Yes. I would say the outlook for renewable diesel, it is difficult to predict exactly how it will play out because you do have additional capacity coming online and into fixed credit banks for both RINs and LCFS that would naturally say that those credit value should come down with additional capacity, which would narrow RD margins. That being said, we also see that feedstock prices continue to come down, both waste oil and veg oil. So then you get into the waste oils will always structurally have a lower CI advantage over veg oil. So where veg oils will be long, they still won't be competitive to waste oils into compliance markets. So it goes back to the core of the DGD business, which is a low-cost producer waste oils, access to markets besides California. And so, we still see that we'll be competitively advantaged, both from an OpEx and feedstock standpoint. But overall, the outlook, I would say, is we expect that credit prices will continue to narrow. And it's a question of how feedstock prices we'll keep up with that. And so -- and then the last thing, besides diversifying sales away from California is obviously with our project, we'll be diversifying into SAF, which takes some of our product out of this RD market. So we think both of those things make us still the most competitive and advantaged platform in R&D, even in a tightening market. Roger Read : So is it fair to summarize that as there's probably a lot more clarity on, let's call it, the supply side of R&D this year and a lot less clarity on the feedstock side? In other words, where we should look for relative opportunity is probably on your feedstock rather than, say, the sales price of R&D? Eric Fisher : Yes, I think that would be fair to say that most of that is still being a CI advantage in waste oils over vegetable oils. Roger Read : Right, okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe a question on turnaround activity and your looks relatively heavy in the first quarter, is that indicative of what we should expect to be a higher level of overall maintenance for you in 2024, just front-end loaded? And then maybe any thoughts in terms of what you're seeing for overall industry maintenance activity this year. Is this -- should we expect this to be another relatively heavy year? Greg Bram : Ryan, this is Greg. Normally, we don't talk about our overall turnaround plans. You can tell from the guidance, a fair amount of activity for us in the first quarter. I think when we get out through the rest of the year, we'll talk about those periods as we come up to the I think from an industry perspective, we are seeing a fair amount of turnaround activity across the industry in the first quarter. So in kind of to Gary's point, it looks like it's going to be a heavy season for the industry in general, a lot of it in the Gulf Coast to a lot of focus there. . Gary Simmons : The only other thing we may add is although you can see the throughput guidance, we don't really expect it to impact our capture rates. That's right. Ryan Todd : Great. Thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up question on capital spend and growth capital spend. I appreciate it, Homer, you gave a little bit of detail there in terms of some of the things that are competing for the wedge of growth capital within your budget. I mean most of your larger project-driven work is either finished recently or you've got the SAF project, which isn't really all that large. But as you look forward on the horizon, are there any other meaningful environmental or regulatory-driven capital things that we should be keeping our eyes on over the next couple of years that could draw some more capital that way? Or what types of things make -- or should we expect just more of these kind of small little netback-driven projects across the refining side over the next few years? Lane Riggs : Hey Ryan, it's Lane. The way I would think about this is if you go back when we -- historically, we used to sort of spend, I would say, we said $1.5 billion sustainable capital. That would actually include regulatory capital. I mean that's how we frame it. It sort of maintain our assets to generate the earnings we're supposed to and try to work your sustain of your regulatory capital in that, albeit it would be lumpy. And so you're going to average around that number. So that's how we think about the regulatory side of it. I don't really foresee at least right now that we have a large regulatory spend. Clearly, that could always change. In terms of our strategic capital, historically, we were around $1 billion. As an organization, we felt like -- we feel like we can execute $1 billion pretty well. We have some experience over 10, 11 years ago where we spent more on strategic capital and then and it was sort of difficult to manage. And so we, as an organization, we decided that we're going to live within a sort of $1 billion on the upside of strategic capital. Since COVID, we've been at about $0.5 billion, and that's our guidance right now. And we feel like that's a pretty good number year-in and year-out that we're going to steward around that we'll that there'll be enough projects, whether they're in refining or transportation or our renewable platforms that all meet and work through our gated process to meet our return thresholds. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Please go ahead, Paul Cheng : Hey guys, good morning. I just don't know whether this will be Lane or Gary. If we're looking at octane last year that was very strong. If this year that I think a lot of people expect because after last year, the global gasoline demand growth rate probably will slow down China is definitely slowing down. And I think U.S. may even go into a structural because if that will be the case, how you expect the octane lending is going to look like? And what -- how that impact or what kind of impact is on your financial result will be? That's the first question. Gary Simmons : Okay. Yeah. So I would say a couple of things on octane. Certainly, the incremental crude barrel that's been coming on to the market has been a light sweet barrel, which has created more naphta yield coming on to the market. And with pet-chem demand being somewhat down, that incremental barrel of naphta that's being produced is trying to find its way into the gasoline pool. And so what that does is it really causes octanes and naphthas to trade at an inverse when naphtha gets long, naphtha gets weak and then octane starts to trade at a premium. So you can try to blend that naphtha barrel into the gasoline pool. I don't know that we see that being significantly different this year. The one thing I would tell that I've already mentioned, if there's a prolonged -- if there's a prolonged outage in Russia at the refinery that was hit by the drone attack and there's less naphtha out on the market. That could tell you that octanes tend to be a little bit weaker this year. But absent that, I don't see any fundamental differences in the naphtha where octane markets. Greg, I don't know if you have anything? Greg Bram : I agree. Paul Cheng : And Gary, are you guys net long or balanced on octane? Gary Simmons : It varies. I would say we're fairly balanced on octane. We're long naphtha, so you can always soak up octane that way. But overall, in octane, I'd say fairly balanced. Paul Cheng : All right. And Gary, Greg, that you guys have a marketing operation in Mexico and in the Caribbean. In Mexico. Any insight how does the local demand look like? Gary Simmons : Yeah. So our business there continues to grow very, very nicely. Year-over-year, our volumes were up 16% in Mexico. We now have 250 branded sites, which was the largest growing brand in Mexico. I think the big change for this year is in the second quarter of this year, we anticipate the terminal that we'll use in Northern Mexico and Altamira will start up, it will allow us to be more competitive in that region, which we would expect us to then be able to continue the growth that we've seen. Paul Cheng : How about outside your operation, but that the market as a whole, do you see the gasoline market in Mexico is growing or that is maybe a little bit pullback? Gary Simmons : Yeah. So our view is Mexico basically recovered last year to pre-COVID levels. And our expectation is you'll see -- continue to see good growth in the gasoline market in Mexico. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Joe Laetsch of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Laetsch : Hey, team. Good morning. And thanks for my questions. So I wanted to start off going back to an earlier point, you mentioned some of the cold weather on the Gulf Coast in the past couple of weeks. Were there any material impacts to operations or crude and product price dislocations that we should be mindful of for the first quarter? Gary Simmons : No. I would tell you, we had some small operational issues, boiler trips, heater trips, but nothing that's going to materially impact the quarter and we still feel like the throughput guidance that we've given holds. Joe Laetsch : Great, thanks. And, then shifting to renewable diesel. So volumes averaged above nameplate capacity for the year, which is good to see. It seems like a consistent theme about performance there. Any reason why we shouldn't expect a similar level of outperformance in 2024, such as turnarounds or anything? Eric Fisher : Yeah. I think we kept the guidance at the $1.2 billion. We've got a couple of catch changes this year. And obviously, when we convert to staff, there's -- there could be a change in capacity because we do have to run the unit a little harder in that mode. So we're not sure what capacity will look like to that until we get the project on the ground and start it up. So I think this time next year, we'll have an outlook of what our capacity guidance will be whether it's up or down. Joe Laetsch : Got it. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Gabelman : Yeah. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on refining OpEx. And I think the market has been less focused on that metric in recent years, just given all of the strength in the margins but perhaps it becomes a bit more of a focus as margins may be normalized here to some extent. And looking at your system, I think historically, you were at $3.50 per barrel refining OpEx. This year, you were -- I think, around $450 million a barrel at a similar Henry Hub price to historical levels. So just wondering what has been driving that higher OpEx this year versus kind of the pre-COVID level and if you expect it to stay at this higher rate or to come back down? Greg Bram : Hey, Jason, this is Greg. So one of the things that's probably most notable when you think over that period has been electricity prices that not so much natural gas, but on the power side, A lot of the places where we operate have seen power costs, particularly in the summer, be quite a bit higher than we'd seen historically. So that's a part of it. The other part that thinking back over that time frame would also be more recently, some cost inflation pressure, and we've talked about that a few times before. That seems to be easing. So that's something we're working on to rein back in with our suppliers and folks that we worked with. Lane Riggs : Is there Jason, this is Lane. I will say still the lowest cost guide, and we work on this like you cannot imagine you should know that as an organization, we're committed to making sure that we are the best in class with expenses. Jason Gabelman : Yeah. No, we carefully said that is there any expectation to get back down below $4 or is this kind of $4.50 range we should think about moving forward? Yeah, I'm on cue. Lane Riggs : We'll have a look at the numbers. I mean part of the other thing that really drives this in our throughput through even though we have what we would characterize as a variable and fixed cost, we run in through our expenses, most refining expenses are in large part six. So the more barrels we run, the better that metric work. And so you really got to -- the best time of the year to look at that and to really understand that as sort of third quarter, essentially. That's really when you're seeing the system. Normally, we have the signal to run the highest, both things are online and the cost structures are where they are. So it's the best time to get an understanding of where the base OpEx is for the system. Jason Gabelman : Got it. My other question is on the refining growth CapEx, and you rattled off a bunch of what seems like quick-hit projects that clear your return hurdles is what -- is there a way you could kind of frame these projects together in terms of potential improvement to capture and kind of whatever stable margin environment, you would evaluate that on or any type of way you could frame the potential upside from these projects? Or is it alternatively just keeping capture maybe stable and enabling flexibility to keep capture stable? Thanks. Lane Riggs : Yeah. So the way I would think about this is we're going to try to do a little more delineation in our IR pack deck to try to maybe demonstrate the success of a lot of our projects in our gaining process. But we're still disciplined in that we don't want to have all this forward-looking conversation around projects, whether they're small or big or whatever. What we do is we -- we have demonstrated hopefully, to everyone that our process does generate returns and then we had that we've -- like I said earlier, we nominally lease today, I think we have $0.5 billion a year of spend that will generate the returns we think will make its way through the gated process. Jason Gabelman : Understood. Thanks, Jas. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Matthew Blair : Hey thanks for the commentary on light-heavy earlier. I believe Valero runs about 200 a day of WCS at Houston in your Gulf Coast system. Is that correct? And is there any risk to that availability with TMX starting up soon? Gary Simmons : Yeah. So our Canadian volumes vary -- it depends on total heavies -- we're probably 600,000 barrels a day, Greg, right? 500,000 to 600,000 barrels a day, and we have the ability to optimize between Mexican supply, it's live for Venezuela and Canada. Our view of TMX is that you'll still have the Gulf Coast barrels coming from Western Canada. And what it will really do is decrease exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast, and we don't really think that our Gulf Coast system will be materially impacted by TMX. Matthew Blair : Great, thank you. And then I had another question on capital returns. So, keeping in mind that the Q4 buybacks were quite strong, payout ratio of 73% clearly impressive. We just found intriguing that your cash balance actually showed a build year-over-year in 2023. And I would say you started the year with maybe $2 billion of excess cash, ended the year with maybe $3 billion of excess cash. So could you talk about why that happened? Were there any mechanical limits on buybacks or where you locked out of the market? And then of that $3 billion in excess cash that you have now, do you have any sort of internal targets on -- you look to pay down maybe $1 billion or $2 billion of that in 2024? Homer Bhullar : Yeah. Hey Matthew, it's Homer. I mean I think, first of all, we're comfortable with where we are from a cash balance perspective. But we've discussed in the past, we like to stay above $4 billion. We had a very, very strong payout, right, particularly for the quarter, but then also for the year. In terms of paying down, like, for example, we look at debt right on the debt side, we proactively look at our portfolio. Through liability management lens. And so given the strength of our balance sheet, we don't really currently have any pressing need to pay down debt with a net debt-to-cap ratio of 18%. But it's an ongoing evaluation, and it's something that we look at. Matthew Blair : And just to clarify, you said your minimum cash balance is now $4 billion. Homer Bhullar : We like to stay above $4 billion. Lane Riggs : Yeah. And so we changed that. I don't know, it's a couple of years. We're really coming out of COVID. Going into COVID, we'd taken the strategy trying to push it all the way down to two. And found going into COVID our experience was that was probably too low. So we've decided to bring on go ahead and look at our minimum closer to four. Good thing about being a four now versus two before we actually do earn a return on that cash before it was zero. So -- but that's really due to our experience as we went through COVID. Matthew Blair : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This brings us to the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back over to Mr. Bhullar for closing comments. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Donna. So that concludes our opening remarks. I'm sorry, that's -- if you guys have any follow-up questions, obviously, feel free to ping us being the IR team. Thanks again for joining us, and have a wonderful week. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation and interest in Valero. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Valero Energy Corp. First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance. Thank you. Please go ahead. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Lane Riggs, our CEO and President; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and COO; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted financial metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.  I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our earnings release and filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Lane for opening remarks. Lane Riggs : Thank you, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong financial results for the first quarter despite heavy planned maintenance across our refining system. Our team's ability to optimize and maximize throughput while undertaking maintenance activities illustrates the benefits from our long-standing commitment to safe and reliable operations. Refining margins remain supported by tight product balances with supply constrained by seasonally heavy refining turnarounds and geopolitical events. Product demand was strong across our wholesale system with diesel demand higher and gasoline demand about the same as last year. We continue to execute strategic projects and enhance earnings capability of our business and expand our long-term competitive advantage. DGD sustainable aviation fuel or SAF project at Port Arthur is progressing ahead of schedule and is now expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2024.  With the completion of this project, Diamond Green Diesel is expected to become one of the largest manufacturers of SAF in the world. In addition, we are pursuing shorter cash cycle projects that optimize and capitalize on opportunities and improve margins around our existing refining assets. These projects are focused on increasing feedstock flexibility, optimizing the value of our product mix and maximizing utilization of existing conversion capacity. On the financial side, we were paid the $167 million outstanding principal amount of our 1.2% senior notes that matured on March 15. And in January, we increased the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $1.02 per share to $1.07 per share.  Looking ahead, we expect refining margins to remain supported by tight product balances and seasonably low product inventories ahead of the driving season. Longer term, product demand is expected to exceed supply even with the startup of new refineries this year and the limited announced capacity additions beyond 2025.  In closing, we remain focused on things that have been in the hallmark of our strategy, maintaining operating excellence, executing our projects well, disciplined around our capital investments and our commitment to shareholder returns. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Lane. For the first quarter of 2024, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.2 billion or $3.75 per share compared to $3.1 billion or $8.29 per share for the first quarter of 2023.  First quarter 2024 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.3 billion or $3.82 per share compared to $3.1 billion or $8.27 per share for the first quarter of 2023. The refining segment reported $1.7 billion of operating income for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $4.1 billion for the first quarter of 2023. Refining throughput volumes in the first quarter of 2024 averaged 2.8 million barrels per day. Throughput capacity utilization was 87% in the first quarter of 2024. Refining cash operating expenses were $4.71 per barrel in the first quarter of 2024 lower than guidance of $5.10 per barrel, primarily attributed to lower energy costs and higher throughput.  Renewable Diesel segment operating income was $190 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $205 million for the first quarter of 2023. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 3.7 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2024, which was 741,000 gallons per day higher than the first quarter of 2023. The higher sales volumes in the first quarter of 2024 were due to the impact of additional volumes from the DGD Port Arthur plant which started up in the fourth quarter of 2022 and was in the process of ramping up rates in the first quarter of 2023.  Operating income was lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to lower renewable diesel margin in the first quarter of 2024. The ethanol segment reported $10 million of operating income for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $39 million for the first quarter of 2023.  Adjusted operating income was $39 million for the first quarter of 2024. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.5 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2024, which was 283,000 gallons per day higher than the first quarter of 2023. For the first quarter of 2024, G&A expenses were $258 million, net interest expense was $140 million, depreciation and amortization expense was $695 million and income tax expense was $353 million. The effective tax rate was 21%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Included in this amount was $160 million unfavorable impact from working capital and $122 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities associated with the other joint venture member share of DGD.  Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Regarding investing activities, we made $661 million of capital investments in the first quarter of 2024, of which $563 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and the balance was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member share of DGD and other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $619 million in the first quarter of 2024.  Moving to financing activities. We returned $1.4 billion to our stockholders in the first quarter of 2024, of which $356 million was paid as dividends and $1 billion was for the purchase of approximately 6.6 million shares of common stock resulting in a payout ratio of 74% for the quarter. Through share repurchases, we have reduced our share count by over 20% since year-end 2021. With respect to our balance sheet, as Lane mentioned, we repaid the $167 million outstanding principal amount of our 1.2% senior notes that matured on March 15. We ended the quarter with $8.5 billion of total debt, $2.4 billion of finance lease obligations and $4.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents.  The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 17% as of March 31, 2024. And we ended the quarter well capitalized with $5.3 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash.  Turning to guidance. We still expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2024 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts, regulatory compliance and joint venture investments. About $1.6 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and the balance to growth with approximately half of the growth capital towards our low carbon fuels businesses and half towards refining projects. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.79 million to 1.84 million barrels per day. Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day. West Coast at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $4.55 per barrel. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2024. Operating expenses in 2024 should be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.18 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.  Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.5 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the second quarter, net interest expense should be about $140 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $710 million. For 2024, we expect G&A expenses to be approximately $975 million. That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Theresa Chen : I want to get a sense of your product supply and demand outlook from here, maybe talking on Lane's earlier comments. And specifically, what is happening with respect to diesel and jet margins from the recent pullback? And where do you think we'll go from the here? Gary Simmons : It's Gary. I can -- I'll give you some insight as to what we're seeing in the market today and then some thoughts on your final question. Overall, we continue to see strong light product demand. In our system, we've seen gasoline sales trending at levels equal to last year. Diesel sales in our system are actually trending about 2% higher than last year.  So I think when we look at all the data, we would expect gasoline demand to be flat to slightly up from last year. Vehicle models travel data is encouraging, would indicate we could see some gasoline demand surprise to the upside.  Diesel demand flat to slightly down compared to last year. However, again, some of the freight indices appear to be turning and indicate we could start seeing better demand. And then jet fuel demand up year-over-year.  I think that isn't really consistent with the sell-off in distillates like you're seeing. And I think some of that's just attributable to the fact that the market appears to be reacting to headlines. So in particular, you have the drone attacks in Russia, diesel gets very strong.  But then there's a lag in the supply chain. So the physical markets aren't really seeing that interruption in diesel. In fact, Russian exports following the drone attacks was actually higher. And so now we're finally getting to the point where Russian exports are starting to fall off, but the markets have kind of dismissed that, and we've sold off pretty hard.  I think diesel is too weak. And the 2 things I would point to on diesel being too weak, hydroskimming margins in Europe are negative, cracking margins in Singapore are negative and unless something significant has happened on the demand side that we don't see, we need that capacity to run, which would indicate margins are going to have to get stronger from here on. Theresa Chen : Really helpful. And maybe following up on the point about Russia, and I appreciate you going through the dynamics on the diesel exports and such. Maybe looking at the naptha side of things. So if the naptha export starts to fall off as well, what does that imply for octane economics? And in light of maybe more naphtha from some of the new refining capacity added, like what is the net impact and the translation to gasoline margins as a result? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think in order to see any meaningful changes in the price of naphtha or discount to gasoline, you really need to see pet-chem demand pick back up for naphtha and a lot of that is just tied to crude flat price. As long as crude flat price is high, it's hard for naphtha to compete as a feedstock into pet-chems.  And so when that happens, then naphtha is trying to find a home into gasoline, which creates strong octane in order to be able to get it blended into the gasoline pool. Operator : The next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Another really strong quarter. And I wanted to ask about the cash flow payout as you're well above the numbers that you've targeted as the floor and so I guess the $1 billion of repurchase level, do we view that as a sustainable run rate? And how do you think about how investors should anchor to a payout guidance? Jason Fraser : Neil, this is Jason. I'm going to ask Homer to address that question. Homer Bhullar : Yes, Neil, I think given the strength of our balance sheet in the first quarter and the fact that we're not really looking to build more cash, we had a pretty strong payout at 74%. And you'll remember, last quarter was 73%, which ended the year at 60%. So I think you can think of the 40% to 50% range as a long-term through-cycle commitment.  But in periods where fundamentals are strong, balance sheet is good, like it is now, and sustaining growth CapEx and the dividend is covered, you can think of that as a floor. So the 40% to 50% as a floor and I think reasonably expect any excess cash flow to continue to go towards buybacks. Neil Mehta : Okay. That's helpful, Homer. And then follow-up is just on DGD. There was a pull forward of the SAF projects. So it looks like project is tracking well for '24 start-up. So just how -- once it comes into service, what's the back of the envelope of how we should think about the incremental economics? And what type of premium margins do you think you could sustain on SAF barrels? Eric Fisher : Yes, this is Eric. The project -- like you said, the project construction is going well. Start-up will be in the fourth quarter. As far as what we see in uplift, I think if you look to see what the state and federal tax program benefits are, there's a lot of credits that have been stated in the IRA, whether it's 45Z or BTC or PTC. And then in Europe, you've got the Argus quote that I'll kind of give you a good feel of what that product is going to be worth. We've got strong interest in sales, and we do not see a problem moving it at returns that are going to meet our project return threshold. Operator : The next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Probably to come back on some of the macro stuff here. Crude differentials, we've got some, I guess, discipline out of OPEC, we've got TMX starting up, I guess, almost any day now, we have some tightness from some other places that typically have exported heavier crudes to the Gulf Coast. So just curious what you're seeing on the crude, call it, availability front and expectations on differentials? Gary Simmons : Yes, Roger, this is Gary. I think we saw crude differentials move a little bit wider in the first quarter, which we expected and that was mainly just driven by demand with heavy turnaround season in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Demand was off a little bit and allowed the differentials to widen. But we believe that the differentials will be relatively tight through most of the year until you get the OPEC production back on the market. At least the consultant supply-demand balances would indicate maybe third or fourth quarter of this year you'll start to see OPEC production ramp back up. I would tell you, we're not having any trouble in terms of availability of feedstock, it's just more narrow differentials than what we would like. Roger Read : Fair enough. And then to follow up on your earlier comments about the structure of the diesel market, the need for cracks to go up. This time last year, we saw gasoline, for a little while, move above -- gasoline cracks move above diesel cracks, we have that seasonally again. But is there any reason that you would lean into a max gasoline over a max diesel or a blended sort of outlook relative to what you've been doing over the last couple of years here? Gary Simmons : No. I think a lot of that gets driven by availability of intermediate feedstocks, VGO. In a tight VGO market, then you're kind of forced more to swing either gasoline or diesel. So far, availability of VGO has been okay. We've been able to fill all the conversion units, but we'll have to see how that goes moving forward. Operator : The next question is coming from Manav Gupta of UBS. Manav Gupta : Congrats on a strong quarter again, guys. My first question here is the bear thesis on refining somewhere was [indiscernible] and it looks like it's not played out these assets from what we read and hear, one of them doesn't have enough hydrogen, the other doesn't even have an FCC. So most likely will not be providing products to the market, maybe even year-end 2024. But my point is, even if they do start providing the products to the market somewhere in 2025, are these the last 2 ones that you are aware of or there's a big wave coming after this? So I'm trying to understand is, even if these 2 come on, they don't really change the global supply dynamics. So after this, again, we could see the market tightening up again. So if you could help us out there? Gary Simmons : Yes. So we see it exactly like you've described. This year was the year where you had kind of a peak in terms of new capacity additions. And then from this point forward, you get to where global petroleum demand outpaces new refinery capacity additions significantly, and we see several years of tightness. Manav Gupta : Perfect. The other point is that we generally see big projects get delayed, cost overruns, you are somewhere unique. Your projects get announced and the actual start date keeps moving forward from the announcement, which is absolutely unique to you. And I'm just trying to understand like -- how are you doing this? And I'm hoping I get an answer which is more than we have the best people because we already know that. So help us understand how are you pulling forward your projects? Lane Riggs : Manav, it's Lane. That's what I was going to say. But it speaks to the culture. Our culture is very much about high discipline, high accountability and teamwork. We make sure we get the right people into the right jobs and hold them accountable and making sure that they're -- and when I say the right people, they have to be people who are, a, competent; and b, they're willing to work with the other team members who may not necessarily be under them or adjacent to them and ultimately working on behalf of Valero. And we have a high level of visibility with upper-level management because we're a pretty flat organization. So we all know the status of the projects. We all understand where we are in the development cycle and anything -- once the project starts. But I mean it's not like there's -- ultimately, it's about alignment, competency and accountability and that's really the secret sauce. You just got to execute. Operator : The next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe a follow-up a little bit on some of the crude mix questions from earlier. I mean with TMX, there's a lot of focus on what the impact is going to be, particularly on complex Mid-Con refineries that are going to have to run more light sweet crude going forward.  But in some ways, it's similar to what's happened across the broader refining system that's been running more and more light crude across a system that's not always optimized for this. I mean can you talk about what you think this might mean for the optimization of the global refining system with more light sweet crude, what sort of impact does this have on utilization or optimization or general supply as we think about broader market? Gary Simmons : Yes. So this is Gary. So globally, TMX doesn't have that much of an impact. It's just rebalancing the barrels. I think you see some of the heavier barrels from South America that were going to the West Coast won't travel there and they'll probably go more to the Far East and some more TMX barrels starting to go to the West Coast.  So globally, not a big impact. We definitely see that hard-to-see differentials will come in because for a period of time here, we'll have the logistics to completely clear Western Canadian production and that could cause some switching of Mid-Continent refiners that they back off on some of the heavies and go to a lighter diet. And yes, to your -- basically to your comment, certainly in the Gulf Coast as we try to run a lighter diet that's resulted in lower overall utilization because we hit light limits on the crude units. Ryan Todd : And that's probably something that's happening on a broader sets across the system with general global crude mix being lighter, right? Gary Simmons : Yes. I think overall, the average crude gravity is up about 1.5 numbers, which certainly results in lower utilization because especially most new capacity all was designed for medium and heavy sour crudes. Ryan Todd : Maybe switching gears to Diamond Green Diesel. I mean as you think about the broader -- obviously, we've been through a soft spot here on renewable diesel margin with RINs and LCFS pricing low. As you think about the outlook into the back part of this year and into 2025, can you maybe walk through how you view some of the moving pieces that could tighten up that market and improve kind of the relative profitability of whether it's renewable diesel or then eventually SAF in 2025? Gary Simmons : Yes. I think the rest of this year, it's really going to be a question of what some of the other startups look like. We've seen in the news, a lot of announcements of slowdowns, project delays, even some shutdowns. If that capacity comes off-line or slows down, how does that balance versus some of the projects that are starting up in the overall D4 RIN balance at the end of the year? It's a little difficult to throw a dart and know exactly how that's going to end. What we can see is veg oil, whether it's BD or RD is negative. Ag products all look very long right now. We do see -- we were expecting more competition on waste oils. We haven't seen as much of that as we thought we would considering the announced start-ups. So how that balances out for the rest of the year, the thing there is we don't see any change in the RVO obligations. So it's still a question of how much capacity is going into a fixed credit bank in a fixed obligation. And so longer term, if you look at '25, I would think the long-term outlook of RD is still positive because you look at the number of LCFS programs that are still being contemplated by legislation this year, the ramps in Canada and the U.K. continue to be strong. The SAF mandates that are kicking in, in 2025 in Europe, the U.K. are going to create demand. And for us, diversification of your product away from California and your ability to diversify your product slate into SAF are going to be very beneficial to DGD. So I still like the longer-term outlook of '25 and beyond. '24 is a little hard to predict. I think it's still -- it probably still stays long in the D4s, net-net. So it might continue to be sort of a tough year. We think the second quarter from a margin standpoint looks a little better from price lag standpoint, but the back half is still hard to tell with all the moving pieces. But long term, I think you still see a positive outlook, sort of '25 and beyond. Operator : The next question is coming from John Royall of JPMorgan. John Royall : So my first question is on turnarounds, I guess, for Valero and maybe in terms of expectations for the broader industry. Given you and others had a heavy turnaround quarter in the spring, should we expect a lighter fall season and maybe that global supply won't come on as expected, but we could see more supply in the second half coming out of the U.S. because it just lower turnaround than usual? Greg Bram : John, this is Greg Bram. I'll talk about our turnaround activity. Particularly, in the first quarter, we had a pretty heavy turnaround load. You can really see that when you look at our throughput, particularly the Gulf Coast through being much lower. It's just reflective of the work that we had going on. Looking forward, as you know, we've always got turnaround activity going on in our system to varying degrees. The first quarter tends to be the heaviest period, other periods of the year will be lighter, and that's just kind of driven by what we see from a margin standpoint. And there are certain times of the year like the holiday season where you're tending not to try to go into that kind of work that's very intensive.  As far as different periods of time, I won't speak so much to our plans. We have the same information others see about industry turnarounds. It looks like the fourth quarter will be kind of more in the typical range of outages, but it's early to tell. A lot of things will change between now and when we get to the fall season and so we'll see where that lands. But people at least are indicating something that looks like the more typical turnaround level of activity. John Royall : Great. And then I just had a follow-up on Neil's question on returns of capital and probably for Jason or Homer. You're essentially at a full free cash flow payout now. That's what we saw in the first quarter and Homer's comments suggested that -- that's the expectation going forward. I know you've characterized the 40% to 50% of the floor, but is there any thought to changing that framework given that you have your balance sheet where you want it and you seem to be kind of in this new era on returns of capital that don't seem to be kind of peeling back to the old way of looking at things? Jason Fraser : Well, this is Jason. Yes, I can take a stab at that. I mean, we do think about that. And really, we ask you to look more at our actions rather than that statement and -- because we've been above it in the majority of time over the past several years. But we also view that more as a long-term indication through the cycle.  I know we talk about sometimes that's a target and it is, but we don't see any problem with being above it over a consistent period of time, and you should expect us to kind of behave as you said, the last couple of quarters are probably the best indication of the future is how we're going to behave with regard to cash. Operator : The next question is coming from Jo Laetsch of Morgan Stanley. Joseph Laetsch : Congrats on a strong quarter. So I wanted to go back to SAF. Are you seeing enough demand from customers to potentially support an additional project? And then if so, would this -- would any potential announcement come after the first facility is online? Just trying to think about timing overall. Eric Fisher : Yes. I think the -- what we're seeing in terms of the commercial interest exceeds our current capacity with the first project. As we've said, we're doing engineering on the second project. In terms of timing, that's always for us, that's always an issue that we're not going to talk about that until we've decided internally on committing to that. But what I'd say from a macro view, you could clearly -- the units are cookie cutters of each other. The project is nearly identical, the execution time and all of that is going to be very similar. So it's not a technically challenging project or something that would be difficult to fund. It's a question of how we see this market develop and when we decide internally is when we would say something externally. Joseph Laetsch : Great. Yes, that makes sense. And then I was hoping to go back and dig into your comments on Asia refining dynamics earlier, just given the decline in margins that we've seen over the past couple of months. Do you think we're close to a floor over there? And then we've also seen China exports tick up in recent months, how do you think that's been impacting U.S. margins? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think my comment there, when you have cracking margins in Singapore negative and you have hydroskimming margins in Europe negative, it kind of tells you we've hit a floor, we need the capacity to run and I think you'll see margins start to tick back up. Operator : The next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotia. Paul Cheng : The first question, I think, is either for Gary or for Lane. Peer mix start up, and so that's going to bring the WCS, which is mostly the main mix in [indiscernible] heavy oil with really heavy [indiscernible] barrels and [indiscernible]. So when that happens, will your system be able to convert all your -- if the price is right, can your system convert all your heavy intake and the medium intake into using a some form of combination of WCS plus some light barrel or that is not as simple? And also whether the industry will be able to, say, eliminate all the import from the heavy barrel from, say, [indiscernible] from the Middle East, replacing with WCS? That's the first question. Gary Simmons : Yes, Paul, this is Gary. I think what we anticipate there's a lot of coking capacity on the West Coast. I'll just use our Benicia refinery as an example. Benicia was really designed to run A&S. And we think with the barrels that are coming off TMX both the heavies and the lights, you'll be able to blend those together to form something that looks a lot like A&S. And we would expect most West Coast refiners will be doing something similar to that. Paul Cheng : Okay. And second question then, Gary, can you give us some maybe your [ comments ] that what you see in the Mexican market for both gasoline and diesel? Gary Simmons : Yes. So our sales in Mexico have been consistent with historic levels. We're selling just over 100,000 barrels a day. We expect demand in Mexico remains very strong. We would expect to see that kind of ramp up later this year when we get our marine terminal in Altamira up and running, that will make us more competitive in the north and allow us to continue to grow volumes in Mexico. Paul Cheng : Gary, do you have an export number you can share in the first quarter. Gary Simmons : Yes. So we did 103,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports. We did 153,000 barrels of diesel exports and 25,000 barrels a day of jet exports. The diesel number in the first quarter was down year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, and I wouldn't read that as lack of demand. That was really a result of the heavy turnaround activity and just we didn't have barrels available for export. Operator : The next question is coming from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew Blair : Could you talk about your M&A appetite for refining assets? I think it's been about a decade since you did a major deal. Has anything changed regarding your overall outlook on M&A? Lane Riggs : This is Lane. Not really. I mean we always look at everything. I mean if you look at the most prompt sort of big deal that's out there [indiscernible] we sorted as a corporation decided not to engage in that. For whatever reason, whoever the successful buyer they can sort everything out wants to liquidate some of the assets, we'll certainly look at them at that time. But in terms of philosophy, we look at everything, but we also, as a company, because we have done so much buying refineries and merging and acquiring, we understand the full cost to make a refinery run it and certainly at the level that we expect. And so ultimately, that goes into the to our valuation models. Operator : The next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : I had 2 market-based questions. The first, just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing on the West Coast as we move into the summer now that another asset will be permanently shut down there? Are you seeing ratable exports coming from overseas product-wise into that market or do you expect kind of heightened volatility and elevated prices there? Gary Simmons : Yes. So this is Gary. I would tell you, in the first quarter, we saw a little lower demand, at least in our system, California for gasoline, which I think was related to weather. We've seen demand kind of return to normal patterns. And it's very difficult to just speculate and put barrels on the water to import the California market.  So we don't think a lot of people are doing that, and you need to see the market react before you would go ahead and put barrels on the water for import into California. So we think there will be a lot of volatility and it really is all dependent on how refineries on the West Coast run throughout the driving season. Jason Gabelman : Got it. And then my second question, just going back to the commentary around the global lighting crude slate. And you had previously made a comment that crude gravity over the past few years has gone up 3 to 4 points and that's maybe reduced global capacity available by 3 to 4 percentage points. Can you just comment on that dynamic? Gary Simmons : I don't know that I can quantify that. Certainly, that is our view that as the crude gravity goes higher, there's a lot of refining capacity around the world that was designed for a heavier gravity crude diet. It causes some derate crude units, but quantifying it. I don't know that I can do that. I don't know, Greg, if you have? Greg Bram : I don't have any rules of thumb either. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Bhullar for closing comments. Homer Bhullar : Thank you, Donna. Appreciate everyone joining us. Obviously, please feel free to contact the IR team if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you, everyone, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time or log off the webcast, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance. Thank you. You may begin. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With me today are Lane Riggs, our CEO and President; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and COO and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted financial metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our investor relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations including those we've described in our earnings release and filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Lane for opening remarks. Lane Riggs : Thank you, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We are happy to report strong financial results for the second quarter. Our refineries operated well and achieved 94% throughput capacity utilization. We saw continued strength in our U.S. wholesale system with sales exceeding 1 million barrels per day in the second quarter. We also saw a good contribution from our renewable diesel and ethanol segments. On the strategic front, our growth projects are progressing on schedule. The Diamond Green Diesel sustainable aviation fuel project in Port Arthur is still expected to be operational in the fourth quarter. At which point, DGD is expected to become one of the largest manufacturers of SAF in the world. And we continue to pursue short-cycle, high-return optimization projects around our existing refining assets. On the financial side, we remain committed to shareholder returns with a year-to-date payout of 80%. And last week, we announced a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $1.07 per share. Looking ahead, limited announced capacity additions beyond 2025 should support long-term refining fundamentals. In closing, our team's simple strategy of pursuing excellence in operation return-driven discipline on growth projects and a demonstrated commitment to shareholder returns has underpinned our success and positions us well for the future. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Lane. For the second quarter of 2024, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $880 million or $2.71 per share compared to $1.9 billion or $5.40 per share for the second quarter of 2023. The Refining segment reported $1.2 billion of operating income for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $2.4 billion for the second quarter of 2023. Refining throughput volumes in the second quarter of 2024 averaged 3 million barrels per day. Throughput capacity utilization was 94% in the second quarter of 2024. Refining cash operating expenses were $4.45 per barrel in the second quarter of 2024. Renewable Diesel segment operating income was $112 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $440 million for the second quarter of 2023. The renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 3.5 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2024, which was 908,000 gallons per day lower than the second quarter of 2023. Operating income was lower than the second quarter of 2023, due to lower sales volumes resulting from planned maintenance activities and lower renewable diesel margin in the second quarter of 2024. The Ethanol segment reported $105 million of operating income for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $127 million for the second quarter of 2023. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.5 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2024, which was 31,000 gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2023. For the second quarter of 2024, G&A expenses were $203 million, net interest expense was $140 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $696 million and income tax expense was $277 million. The effective tax rate was 23%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Included in this amount was a $789 million favorable change in working capital and $83 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities associated with the other joint venture member share of DGD. Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Regarding investing activities, we made $420 million of capital investments in the second quarter of 2024, of which $329 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and the balance was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to other joint venture member share of DGD and other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $360 million in the second quarter of 2024. Moving to financing activities, we returned $1.4 billion to our stockholders in the second quarter of 2024, of which $347 million was paid as dividends and $1 billion was for the purchase of approximately 6.6 million shares of common stock, resulting in a payout ratio of 87% for the quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.8 billion to our stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, resulting in a payout ratio of 80%, well above our minimum commitment of 40% to 50%. With respect to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of total debt, $2.4 billion of finance lease obligations and $5.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 16% as of June 30, 2024. And we ended the quarter well capitalized with $5.3 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We still expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2024 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts regulatory compliance and joint venture investments. About $1.6 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and the balance to growth with approximately half of the growth capital towards our low carbon fuels businesses and half towards refining projects. For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.77 million to 1.82 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 405,000 to 425,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 235,000 to 255,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 390,000 to 410,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be approximately $4.70 per barrel. With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2024. Operating expenses in 2024 should be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.18 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.6 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the third quarter, net interest expense should be about $140 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $690 million. For 2024, we expect G&A expenses to be approximately $975 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, please limit each turn in the Q&A to two questions to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : One of my questions were on the refining macro side and more specifically, your views on supply and demand. The U.S. system ran pretty hard through 2Q. We built some inventories on both the gasoline and the diesel side. What are you seeing on the demand side in both the U.S. and globally? And how do you view the overall supply/demand balance today? Gary Simmons : John, this is Gary. I think in the U.S., for the most part, the economy has been fairly resilient and the market fundamentals look pretty similar to what we've been looking at the past couple of years. If you look at our wholesale data, four-week average, our gasoline sales are up about 0.5%. There tends to be a lot of noise in the weekly DOE data. But year-to-date, DOE data would suggest a slight decline in gasoline demand less than 1%. You look at vehicles mile travel, they're up 1.4%, which would again indicate a slight increase in demand for gasoline. I guess the way we're looking at it is, we'd say, year-over-year, gasoline demand in the U.S. is flat. On the diesel side, we're actually showing a pretty good step change in our system on diesel sales, four-week average diesel sales in our system are up 10%. Again, don't necessarily believe that's representative of the broader markets. If you look at year-to-date, diesel sales and the DOE data, it would suggest a decline in diesel demand about 100,000 barrels a day. Directionally, I think that makes sense to us with a little weaker freight numbers early in the year. You didn't really have any help from weather, a little less demand from the upstream sector. However, a lot of that has been offset with the increase in jet demand. So about half of that offset with an increase in jet demand. So maybe distillate demand down slightly. In the U.S., we would say gasoline demand flat year-over-year, distillate demand down slightly. I think the bigger impact has really been for the overall North Atlantic Basin. Certainly, in the North Atlantic Basin, we saw regions with slowing economic activity that negatively impacted, especially demand for diesel. And then it looks like some of the new capacity that came on in the Middle East really never made it to nameplate capacity until early this year. So we saw a bit of a step change in refining runs in the Middle East with a lot of that product making its way into Europe. So some of that early in the year was masked with some of the drone strikes on Russian refining capacity. But the combination of higher refinery runs in the Middle East, a little sluggish economic activity in parts of the Atlantic basin allowed restocking of inventories in the region. So with that, we've obviously seen refinery margins weaken some. We haven't had any type of major weather event take down refining capacity like we've seen the past few years. Of course, we're right in the middle of hurricane season so you still have that potential. So with refinery runs up in the North Atlantic basin lined with a little softer diesel demand, you've seen that restocking. We've gone from well below the five-year average total light product inventory to trending more to the bottom end of the five-year average range. As inventories tend to trend towards the five-year average, you would expect to see margin environment closer to a mid-cycle type margin environment. That's kind of what we're seeing. It does feel as the market has found a bit of a bottom consultant data indicates at least earlier this week, hydroskimming margins in Europe and the Far East were negative, cracking margins in the Far East negative. And if that's correct, and we found the bottom, it is what historically been a mid-cycle type refining margin environment, that's -- it's actually pretty bullish refining going forward. As we move into the third quarter, we'll see -- start to see a little lower utilization, mainly turnarounds affecting refinery utilization. Most of the consultant data actually shows year-over-year demand growth was more weighted to the back end of the year. So hopefully, we see a little bit better demand. Some of the freight indices are starting to turn. Market in Europe looks actually pretty strong, which has closed the arb to send gasoline from Europe to the United States, open the arb to send U.S. Gulf Coast diesel to Europe. So I think you'll see some tightening of supply-demand balances in the near-term. And then longer term, we see very little new refining capacity additions with continued demand growth, which should be bullish margins in the long-term. John Royall : And then my second question is on capital returns. You had another very strong quarter in this quarter, I think you're above 80% of CFO. How do you think about the cadence on the buyback going forward from here? And any thought on leading into the balance sheet for capital returns? Jason Fraser : John, this is Jason. I might just ask Homer to answer that one for you. Homer Bhullar : Sure. So, John, we haven't really had to lean into the balance sheet for shareholder returns. I mean, in fact, if you look back to 2020, we've been able to fund all of our uses of cash, including over $6.5 billion of capital investments. We've paid down over $4 billion of debt and over $17 billion of shareholder returns over that period all through cash flow from operations. In fact, we've actually built cash since 2020. So I think consistent with what we've been guiding to, given the strength in our balance sheet and our current cash position, we continue to lean into buybacks with a payout ratio at 87% for the second quarter and 80% year-to-date. Again, all funded within cash flow despite a lower margin environment. So I think looking forward in periods where the balance sheet is strong as it is now, we've got sustaining CapEx, the dividend and strategic CapEx covered, you can reasonably think about 40% to 50% as a floor and continue to expect any excess free cash flow go towards share buybacks. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research. Douglas Leggate : Gary, I appreciate all your comments about the macro, but I'm afraid I'm going to ask another one, if you don't mind. Everything you've said makes an enormous amount of sense except for the fact that it seems that globally on a net basis, we're now back to a net surplus in terms of refinery additions compared to right before COVID. And obviously, Dangote is part of that, but we've had whiting come back online and utilization it seems it's now running pretty well. So I'm just curious as to how you think that cleans up. Do we need another turnaround capital event, like a turnaround cycle to see some of those closures? Or do you see it differently? Gary Simmons : No, I think we see it the same way. I think you'll see some improvement in economic activity, which will improve diesel demand. And then for us, you've had the impact of Dangote and [Despoc] starting to be absorbed in the market. Offsetting that, there are 600,000 barrels a day of announced refinery closures. We're not sure when the timing of those will actually occur. But as you start to see more refinery rationalization occur, I don't again tighten up the supply-demand balances longer term. Douglas Leggate : My follow-up is kind of related to that because, I mean, you guys are -- there's no question you guys are and will probably continue to be the cost leader in terms of your system, best-in-class in the U.S. for sure. The issue we're trying to figure out is where the vulnerabilities are across the U.S. in terms of the marginal refinery. And I guess for you guys, we're curious what's going on in the West Coast because just last week, we had the lowest margin since COVID on the West Coast and Benicia is obviously out there. We thought it was going to do better because of TMX. So can you maybe help us understand what is the role of Benicia in the portfolio and what do you see in the West Coast dynamics currently? Lane Riggs : Doug, this is Lane. I'll start and then I'll let Gary follow-up on the TMX question. When you think about our portfolio, the West Coast clearly is the highest cost region we operate in. It's just by virtue of everything that goes on in the West Coast, it's the most expensive to operate with. And historically, the way it works there is you have marginal economics and then the balances would be such that you'd have an allergen, you would sort of experienced a period of higher margins, and then it would go back. So it's really almost a call option on West Coast spreads. And it is a harder place to operate is a more expensive place to operate. And so when you look across the U.S., I mean, I would expect that's probably one of the places that you would ultimately see some refinery closures in this shakes out. And then I'll let Gary. Gary Simmons : Yes. The only thing I'd add to that is we did have the view that with some of the refinery conversions to make renewable fuels that you would see, especially gasoline pretty tight. But if you look from April to the end of June, imports -- gasoline imports into the West Coast were up 70,000 barrels a day. And I think that, combined with a little softer demand is why you're seeing that margin environment on the West Coast that we're seeing today. As far as TMX, TMX started up beginning of May. They didn't load the first cargo out until the end of May. We didn't load our first cargo out until June. So really, any impact you're going to see from TMX wasn't reflected in our second quarter results. You won't start to see that until third quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Maybe you take a slightly different direction here. Policy wise, at the end of June, the Supreme Court took out Chevron deference and there's a lot of ways to interpret that and some of the other things going on politically with the election. But I was just curious if you had any thoughts about -- on the policy front on that, I guess, you call it judicial front, how that might affect any parts as we think about some of the CAFE standard stuff and then has been mentioned the challenges in getting permits to do things on the expansion side? Richard Walsh : This is Rich Walsh. And so, hey, you never get a great legal question like this on our earnings call. So this is exciting. And so I'm going to try not to get too wonky here, but I just -- with Chevron deference, right, the -- under that program, the courts were required to give agencies complete deference as to their interpretations to their own authority. And so it made it really difficult for the judiciary to kind of rein in the administrative state. And so what you see the Supreme Court doing is they really basically restored a meaningful judicial review over this. So that now judges are required to use their best reading of the statute. And while the agencies have historically viewed that they're entitled to this deference and the agencies generally believe they've got the right reading of the statute. I think everybody is going to kind of come to the realization that the range of interpretation that's going to be acceptable is not is not going to be as wide. And you're clearly going to have judges who are empowered now to kind of look at the statute and not just defer to the agency on it. So as a practical matter of how that works is I think you're going to see less agency overreach in terms of how they interpret it and you're certainly going to see less political swings in the agencies in terms of how they often shift back and forth depending on the administration. And then I think if you kind of pair that together with major questions doctrine and you're really looking at kind of trying to -- I think what the court is trying to do is put policy back in the hands of the legislator back in the hands of Congress and not let it be really policy driven at the administrative level. And so -- and just as a practical matter, we've seen that already happen. The Supreme Court sent back nine cases already asking the lower courts to review their decisions in light of not giving deference to the agency. So when you talk about our existing litigations, we really don't talk about the litigation specifically, but I would say you've seen some pretty extreme interpretations here, in particular, the administration taking the position that they, without congressional mandate can go in and mandate electrification of vehicles. That's hard to see how that -- how the courts give them deference on that question. And it's certainly hard to see how that's not already covered under the major questions doctor in the West Virginia case. So I feel like I'm getting a little wonky here. So let me just kind of wrap that up with that thought. Roger Read : And yes, it is one of those types of topics. So the only follow-up we really had on that, and I think you kind of answered it as the timing to have impacts of this could be like, what the next 12 to 24 months? Or does it take longer? Richard Walsh : Well, there's already a California waiver case queued up in front of the Supreme Court on a [certain] petition. Now it was -- the DC circuit dismissed that one based on a standing type issue, but they really were trying to avoid, I think, addressing the underlying question. So it will be -- there's a number of cases coming up. There's a CAFE case that's already been argued in front of the DC circuit that specifically queued up. So I think these changes will happen quicker than people traditionally expect from the judiciary. Operator : Our next question is from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe one back on refining supply/demand. Clearly, part of the issue in the second quarter here has been supply driven. The system has been running really, really well with high utilization rates. Are you seeing -- just curious if you look at the consumer, are you seeing run cuts across any parts of the globe that you can see have an impact on the supply side. And as you look at your third quarter guidance, it implies lower throughput versus 2Q, is that maintenance? Is there some commercial activity there? Just curious as you see kind of how you see dynamics on the supply side here in the third quarter as a possible tailwind for margins? Greg Bram : Ryan, this is Greg. I'll talk about our system. So you do see that our throughput guidance considers planned maintenance activity we have in the quarter. So particularly if you take a look at like the North Atlantic, you see that there. Otherwise, I would just say for our system, we're optimizing our refineries in light of these market conditions, just like we always do. So, some of that might be reflected in the guidance as well. But you can definitely see where the planned maintenance activity is having an impact. Ryan Todd : And then maybe on a broader question. I mean, you've argued for generally tight global refining markets and probably higher for longer type of mid-cycle margins. Has anything from the 2024 margin environment that we've seen this year change this view? Or do you still view that kind of as consistent with the outlook going forward? Lane Riggs : This is Lane. I think if you sort of listen to Gary's opening comments and you think about our -- what we have said is that we do believe going forward, you're going to have a higher margin environment. You're seeing -- we're seeing refinery make cuts what at least we would have historically thought was a mid-cycle and so that -- which is an interesting thing to say, well, there are refineries out there that are seeing marginal economics in the -- historically mid-cycle economic environment. And so that would tell you, we don't know where the lows are. You're telling let's indicate that the call on refining is because of that, there's some thrown that have -- that are cutting in this space. So again, it just reinforces our view that you have a higher margin for our capital and higher mid-cycle going forward. Operator : Our next question is from Manav Gupta with UBS. Manav Gupta : My first question is your outlook on the Gulf Coast heavy sour differential looks like OPEC will start adding volumes somewhere in the fourth quarter and then continue to do that in 2025, and then also there is a bigger refining asset in that area, which uses a lot of that crude, which will be hopefully closing down in early 2025. So your outlook -- medium-term outlook for the heavy sour differential on the Gulf Coast. Gary Simmons : Manav, this is Gary. So I think in the short-term, we've seen heavy sour differentials move a little wider. That was mainly a Mid-Continent refiner that's had a complete power outage that's decreased the demand for Canadian heavy. As we move through the third quarter, you'll see a turnaround activity in the Mid-Continent, especially also decreased demand for Canadian heavy, which is supportive of the differentials. And then longer term, I think the two things you pointed towards, for meaningful, sustainable wider heavy sour differentials, you really need more OPEC production back on the market. We're unsure exactly when that occurs. But yes, our view has been late this year, early next year, you start to see more OPEC barrels on the market, which will create wider heavy sour differentials. The other thing I'd point to is even with where the differentials were in the second quarter, we saw a significant economic uplift by running heavy sour crudes in the second quarter even with where the differential were. Manav Gupta : My follow-up here is, as you're approaching your completion on the SAF unit, are there any preliminary estimates we should think about how much of an uplift could this change going from early to SAF provide to you guys? Eric Fisher : Manav, this is Eric. We were not going to give out like specifics like that. I would say you can look at the various programs, the state programs, the federal tax credits around whether it's BTC or PTC and then the mandate in the EU and the U.K. all kind of give you an indicator of what that uplift will be Argus has got a quote that you can look at. What we would say is that there is a premium of SAF over RD, and it's all going to be give us a margin that will be stronger than RD. And our outlook is that we'll meet the economics of our projects. So all of that looks pretty positive. Operator : Our next question is from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Theresa Chen : I wanted to go back to one of Gary's comments earlier on demand across your footprint, the 10% year-over-year uptick on the diesel side, which is not representative of the broader market. Can you give some color on how you've been able to take market share what seems to be on a continued basis at this point? Gary Simmons : Well, I guess I'd just say our wholesale team has done a great job for us on growing our market share. And then some of that has also been due to some of the refinery rationalization that took place, especially during the COVID period. It's allowed us to grow our market share as well. Theresa Chen : And following up on the renewable fuel economics, Eric, can you provide an update on your outlook for the different subsidy prices over the near to medium-term, especially with the election around the corner? Eric Fisher : Yes, that's something everyone is trying to figure out and it's a really difficult dart to throw these days. I think one of the things we look at is, the RIN market still looks oversupplied to us. So as we kind of get into the back end of '24, it looks like the RIN market is long, the California LCFS market will remain long and therefore, we think with fat prices starting to increase, we see compression in RD margins in the back half of '24. The policy things that are coming up, LCFS might expand with California. They're still saying that's going to be a 2025 change. The RIN update for 2026 got pushed to March of '25. But with all the expectations that Ag has on the RFS volumes, we expect that will probably be some sort of increase. So I think longer term in sort of the next one to two years, we see a lot of tailwind for DGD in terms of credit prices. Specific to our platform, we are obviously diversifying into SAF. That's going to be a diversification away from RD with -- that includes a premium to RD. So that looks pretty strong. And then the other thing that will be interesting because this is being looked at now is, are we going to have a BTC or PTC transition January 1. And as we've said in the past, the RIN and the BTC have a relationship that previously, when we discussed the BTC going away, we expected the RIN to increase to keep the biodiesel producer at breakeven. So when you think about a BTC to PTC transition where the PTC is less than $1, there is some view that the RIN will have to pick up the difference in order to keep the biodiesel blender breakeven. So you have a little bit of a discussion of the market and the credits look long but the relationship between BTC, PTC and the RIN has always been somewhat of a factor of rebalancing the market. How fast that happens, how soon that happens, the timing of that, given the elections, those are all kind of up in the air. But I think structurally, as you look forward, all of this looks pretty good for DGD. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : I think this is for Gary. Gary, can I go back into your comment. First low in May and so now just two months. So where you can see, do you think the impact on the West Coast market from the TMX is now fully retracted in the marketplace? Or the thing over the several months that we do have solution indication to the crude defense in that market? Secondly, maybe this is either for Gary or for Lane. As the market normalizes, how does it impact the way how your refining operations run in terms of the sustainable maximum run rate crude yield or product yield, whatever that you can give some comments that would be great. Gary Simmons : Yes. I'll start with TMX, Paul. Yes, I think that it took a little while for the West Coast market to respond to TMX. If you look though at where ANS was trading prior to the TMX start-up, and kind of where September is trading relative to Brent, ANS has come off in the $1.50 to $2 range, which is in line with what we thought the impact TMX would have on West Coast crude costs. I just don't think you'll see that show up until more third quarter. Lane Riggs : I'll take a shot at the second one. Paul, this is Lane. I don't really see as the world sort of settled on some other places that impacts our operations. We always take signals from the market. We focus on being reliable. We focus on execution. We don't move turnarounds and do things like that based on whether we think the markets good now, not later. Our idea is operational excellence means that we wake up every day, we try to -- where we will execute in a way there were the best operator that we can be, which we think we are the best operator out there. And so we don't really profoundly see any change based on necessarily some sort of different refining outlook. Operator : Our next question is from Joe Laetsch with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Laetsch : So on the refining side and on the export side, specifically, would you mind just giving us an update on Mexico? And if I remember right, I think there was a new terminal opening there this year as well. Gary Simmons : Yes. So this is Gary. I would tell you our volumes to Mexico were down a little bit. We've been fairly consistently sending about 100,000 barrels a day in the second quarter that was more like 87,000 barrels a day. For us, it's just another knob we have in optimizing our Gulf Coast system. And with where PEMEX was pricing the barrels, we had better alternatives. It's not a shift. Moving forward, we do think you'll see some growth in our Mexico volumes. Our terminal that we'll utilize an Altamira will start up before the end of the year. It will allow us to be more competitive in the Northern Mexico market and allow us to continue to grow our volumes there. Joseph Laetsch : And then shifting over to RD. So I know you talked about this a little bit earlier and feedstock costs have been higher over the past couple of months, but could you just talk about a little bit more about what you're seeing on the feedstock cost side as well as availability here with some of the new start-ups? Eric Fisher : Yes. We have noticed that there is growing competition for waste oils, we're still the largest importer of foreign waste oils. So if we look at that they were used -- if I compare it to last year, there was a pretty good arb of foreign feedstocks over domestic feedstocks being more advantaged. What we see that is that's largely incorporated and now domestic feedstocks look to be the most attractive from a cost standpoint. From a CI standpoint, those are still all the most advantaged feedstocks for RD, but we do see overall particularly waste oil feedstocks starting to increase. So I would say it looks like feedstock prices have bottomed out here in the second quarter. They're starting to trend up a little bit in the third quarter, largely attributed to some of the start-ups that we see in California. Operator : Our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Staying on refining, I just love your guys perspective on the coking market, especially in light of Port Arthur coming online, which was a really good asset. And just your perspective on fuel oil and the opportunity around how of coking and how that those margins can start to normalize over time? What's the sequence of events that we'll get back to tap? Greg Bram : Neil, this is Greg. So we still see good value in coking margins. Gary talked about where the heavy sour crude market has been. That's with our coker online and with the industry running the way it has. So I don't think that we see something that's a big step change going forward. As Gary mentioned, as you put -- as you get some more medium sour, heavy crude into the market later this year that should enhance that value. But right now, it's still a strong opportunity for us still beats our other modes of operation and something we're looking to maximize. Neil Mehta : And then the follow-up is around Asia and specifically around China, as we look at oil demand data, one of the things that disappointed our model has been Chinese domestic demand. Do you see it -- as you look at the data, and that's a part of the contribution to some of the softness in PADD 5 and in the Asian refining margin lift in the absence of strong Chinese demand? Gary Simmons : Neil, this is Gary. We don't have a lot of visibility into the markets in the Far East. But I would tell you, certainly, what you read is in China, especially diesel demand is down. We see as much as 10% a lot less construction activity there. But for the most part, it looks like they've adjusted refinery runs to say somewhat balanced on exports. Now we would say exports are up slightly. But for the most part, they've adjusted refinery runs to balance demand, and we haven't seen a significant step change in their exports. Operator : Our next question is from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : I wanted to go back to the wholesale channel growth. And it's been pretty consistent over the past few years. And I'm wondering, if you can provide some sort of earnings estimate in terms of an uplift from selling through that channel relative to maybe some pre-COVID period or other baseline you have available and if you expect that growth to continue? Gary Simmons : Yes. The only comment, we don't really give a lot of detail around our wholesale margins. Obviously, the growth is because that's our most -- the positive netback for our Gulf Coast system and our U.S. system, and that's why we continue to push it to grow. So that should be reflected in capture rates going forward, but we don't really give a lot of detail on what those margins are. Jason Gabelman : Can you provide on a volumetric basis, how much it's grown and how much more you think you could push to that channel? Gary Simmons : Yes, I can, roughly. I mean, you look three years ago, we were fairly consistently in the 850,000 barrel range and now over 1 million barrels a day. So somewhere in the neighborhood of 150,000 barrels a day of growth in wholesale is what I'd tell you over the last few years. Homer Bhullar : Jason, there's a page, I think Page 24 in the deck, which goes all the way back to 2012 for more color. Jason Gabelman : And then just specifically on results in refining. I think co-products were a pretty decent headwind to capture. I'm wondering how much that shaved off capture rates in 2Q and if you're seeing any reversal of those headwinds going into 3Q, especially as crude has started to fall? Greg Bram : Yes, Jason, this is Greg. You're right. That was a headwind. I don't know if I have the exact amount. And that will come and go over time, certainly was working against us in the second quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Matthew Blair : Maybe just sticking on capture. I think it makes sense that your capture was lower quarter-over-quarter just due to those challenges in the co-products, at the same time, I believe that the Q2 capture was the lowest absolute number in like five or year years. So has anything changed structurally on your capture compared to even just like last year? Greg Bram : So this is Greg. Yes, there were a few things going on in the second quarter that I think had some impact specific to this period. One, we always talk about the seasonal RVP change in gasoline and how that can have a negative impact on margin capture as you pull the butane out of the gasoline that you were able to do in the winter time. So certainly, that was a piece. We also saw crude market backwardation fairly strong in second quarter, which impacts crude cost, the acquisition cost for crude. Yes, it was probably $0.80 to $0.90 a barrel relative to prior quarter and even looking back at some of the other periods in time. We talked about the co-products, naphtha propylene in particular. And I think the other thing maybe worth noting that is a bit unique to the second quarter, we always pride ourselves on being able to go secure some of those opportunity feedstocks that we can run in our system, particularly in our Gulf Coast system with all the flexibility we have there. And I would just tell you in the second quarter, just the way the market played out, there just wasn't a lot of that opportunity to be had, not that we weren't looking for it. It's just the way kind of the market shaped up. And so that's a bit unique from what we've seen in the past. And I would expect we'd see those kind of opportunities when we look forward going in future periods. Matthew Blair : And then on the ethanol side, if I could ask, how sustainable do you think this recent uptick in ethanol margins is? And also, is there an update on the Summit carbon capture project? When do you expect that to start up and benefit your ethanol plants? Eric Fisher : Sure. On the ethanol side, this increased margin is really a result of cheap natural gas prices as well as cheap corn. If you look at all of the carryout numbers for this year, with Brazil having a record crop, the U.S. having a record crop forecasted, the carryout is going to be pretty large. That means we're still carrying a fairly large inventory of corn from last year. The harvest that's coming up is going to be another large inventory. So we -- so I see corn fairly cheap barring weather event between now and harvest or something dramatic in Brazil. So I think the -- I'm positive on the ethanol outlook for the next -- for this -- the rest of this year and into next year. After that, it's always harvest to harvest of what the next outlook will look like after that. As far as Summit, that's not our project. That's really a question for Summit. They just got their approval in Iowa. We still view carbon sequestration as a supportive strategy for ethanol, but that's -- we're just a shipper on that project. So if and when that gets put in the ground where we'll happily hook up to it and provide volume into that system, but we don't really have a whole lot of insight into the project itself. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Homer for closing remarks. Homer Bhullar : Great. Thank you. I appreciate everyone joining us today. As always, feel free to contact the IR team if you have any additional questions. Thank you, and have a great week. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance. Thank you. You may begin. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Lane Riggs, our CEO and President; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO, and Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and COO; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted financial metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our earnings release and filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Lane for opening remarks. Lane Riggs : Thank you, Homer, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect a period of heavy maintenance in our refining segment during a relatively weak margin environment. Our refineries operated at 90% throughput capacity utilization in line with our guidance for the quarter. Product demand across the system remained strong with our U.S. wholesale volumes exceeding 1 million barrels per day for the second consecutive quarter. On the strategic front, we remain committed to executing projects that continue to enhance the earnings capability of our business and expand our long-term competitive advantage. I'm proud to report that the Diamond Green Diesel Sustainable Aviation Fuel or SAF project is now mechanically complete and is in the process of starting up. The project was completed on schedule and under budget and is a testament to the strength of our projects and operations teams. On the financial side, we continue to honor our commitment to shareholder returns with a strong payout ratio of 84% for the quarter and the year-to-date payout of 81%. Looking ahead, improving diesel demand against the backdrop of low light product inventories should support refining margins. Increases in OPEC plus crude supply should widen our sour crude oil differentials and further increase margins. And longer term, we expect product demand to exceed supply with the announced refinery shutdowns next year and limited capacity additions beyond 2025, supporting long-term refining fundamentals. In closing, our focus on operational excellence, capital discipline and honoring our commitment to shareholder returns have served us well and will continue to anchor our strategy going forward. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Lane. For the third quarter of 2024, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $364 million or $1.14 per share compared to $2.6 billion or $7.49 per share for the third quarter of 2023. The refining segment reported $565 million of operating income for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $3.4 billion for the third quarter of 2023. Refining throughput volumes in the third quarter of 2024 averaged 2.9 million barrels per day or 90% throughput capacity utilization. Refining cash operating expenses are $4.73 per barrel in the third quarter of 2024. Renewable Diesel segment operating income was $35 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $123 million for the third quarter of 2023. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 3.5 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2024, which was 552,000 gallons per day higher than the third quarter of 2023. The ethanol segment reported $153 million of operating income for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $197 million for the third quarter of 2023. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.6 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2024, which was 255,000 gallons per day higher than the third quarter of 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, G&A expenses were $234 million, net interest expense was $141 million, depreciation and amortization expense was $685 million and income tax expense was $96 million. The effective tax rate was 20%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Included in this amount was $166 million favorable change in working capital and $47 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities associated with the other joint venture member share of DGD. Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Regarding investing activities, we made $429 million of capital investments in the third quarter of 2024, of which $338 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and the balance was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member share of DGD and other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $394 million in the third quarter of 2024. Moving to financing activities. We returned $907 million to our stockholders in the third quarter of 2024, of which $342 million was paid as dividends and $565 million was for the purchase of approximately 3.8 million shares of common stock, resulting in a payout ratio of 84% for the quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned $3.7 billion to our stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, resulting in a payout ratio of 81%, well above our long-term minimum commitment of 40% to 50%. In fact, since the start of 2021, our total cash flows from operations have exceeded our total uses of cash over this period, including capital investments over $4 billion of debt reduction and over $18 billion returned to stockholders through dividends and share buybacks. With respect to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of total debt, $2.5 billion of finance lease obligations and $5.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 17% as of September 30, 2024, and we ended the quarter well capitalized with $5.3 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We still expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2024 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts regulatory compliance and joint venture investments. About $1.6 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and the balance to growth with approximately half of the growth capital towards our low carbon fuels businesses and half towards refining projects. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.83 million to 1.88 million barrels per day Mid-Continent at 425,000 to 445,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 230,000 to 250,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 380,000 to 400,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $4.60 per barrel. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we still expect sales volumes to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2024. Operating expenses in 2024 should be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.18 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.7 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the fourth quarter, net interest expense should be about $140 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $690 million. For 2024, we expect G&A expenses to be approximately $975 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, please limit each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits to ensure other callers have time to ask your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question is coming from Manav Gupta of UBS. Manav Gupta : My first question here is, can you talk a little bit about the demand for key products and how that is trending as we are coming to a close in 2024? Gary Simmons : Sure, Manav. This is Gary. Obviously, a much weaker refinery margin environment than we -- in the third quarter than we've seen in the last couple of years. The interesting thing to us is it looks like the underlying market fundamentals actually improved during the third quarter and have continued to improve as we move into the fourth quarter, despite that, the improving market fundamentals, market sentiment seems to turn more negative, driving crack spreads even lower. To us in the markets where we have a presence, things look very similar to what we've seen in the past couple of years. Lane alluded to our sales in the third quarter through wholesale over 1 million barrels a day. We averaged 1.8 million in the third quarter, which is actually up year-over-year. Gasoline sales were fairly flat year-over-year. Diesel sales actually increased year-over-year. Thus far in the fourth quarter, we've actually seen about a 40,000 barrel a day increase in sales to our wholesale channel. So it's actually going up. You kind of compare that to get an indication of demand with some other indicators. Vehicle models traveled, were up about 1%. So that kind of matches with our numbers. Even the DOE data, although there's a lot of noise week to week. If you look at the year-to-date demand numbers from the DOE would kind of show gasoline demand flat to slightly up. And so we think that's kind of where we are. Again, I said diesel sales in our system up a little bit year-over-year. Again, if you look at some of the other indicators of the demand, especially the freight indices would indicate demand for diesel is a little bit softer compare that to the DOE numbers in the year-to-date DOE numbers, which show diesel demand down close to 100,000 barrels a day, I think we think that's pretty close. Some of that gap in diesel demand has been made up by an increase in jet fuel demand, about half of that. So net-net, I think in the U.S., we feel like total light products kind of flat to slightly down year-over-year. markets outside the U.S. where we have a significant market presence in Canada, the U.K., Mexico, all very similar trends. I think all three of those markets have witnessed a year-over-year growth in gasoline demand, year-over-year growth in jet demand and the decline in diesel demand. So demand looks pretty strong outside those markets. We continue to see good export demand. Gasoline exports in the third quarter, about 100,000 barrels a day typical markets, Latin America and Canada. Diesel exports in the third quarter were 260,000 barrels a day, again, kind of South America and Europe. So we continue to see demand that looks very similar to what we've seen in the last couple of years in the markets where we have a strong presence. Manav Gupta : Perfect, Gary, so my quick follow-up is, if there are no real red flags here in demand, and it's lightly softer in U.S., but stronger outside. Why did we suddenly hit this environment where the cracks are kind of trending below mid-cycle? And is that -- and do you see this as transient if the demand holds then the track should be able to get back to mid-cycle or maybe even higher? Gary Simmons : Yes, Manav, I would say some of this, typically on the third quarter earnings call, you tend to have a little more negative market sentiment. And there\u2019s some reasons for that. Each year around Labor Day, you typically had some hurricane hype in the market that tends to go away as people view your out of hurricane season, you\u2019ve gone through RVP transition, you start our RVP transition on gasoline, slowing the gasoline pool. Labor Day kind of marks the end of driving season. So you can certainly understand some negative market sentiment around gasoline. And typically, the fourth quarter and first quarter tend to be driven more by strength in the distillate cracks. I think we came into this year and although the U.S. economy has been fairly resilient. We\u2019ve seen some pockets of economic weakness throughout the globe, which have driven down diesel demand a little bit. And cause the pessimism around diesel cracks. If you look at where things are, though, the fundamentals look strong. We\u2019re going into the year with very low inventories, gasoline inventory, 10 million barrels below where we were last year at this time, below the 5-year average. Some of the key things we tend to be focused on in the gasoline markets at this time of the year, market structure, market structure is backwards. So there\u2019s no incentive to produce and store summer-grade gasoline. Typically, in the fourth quarter, the first quarter, you will have a positive transatlantic arb to ship from Europe to New York Harbor, at least on paper that arb is closed throughout the fourth quarter. Export demand for gasoline remains strong. We\u2019re seeing good export demand into Latin America. So things look good for gasoline. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see any big moves in the gas crack anytime soon. But as long as inventory remains in check, you get back into driving season RVP transition, we would expect gas cracks to respond. On the distillate side, again, like gasoline, the key thing is, although we\u2019ve seen a little bit less demand than we\u2019d hoped for. Distillate inventories are trending toward the lows that we\u2019ve seen the last couple of years. I think you saw economic run cuts throughout parts of the world that took some supply off the market. Here recently, we\u2019ve had turnaround activity, decreased supply as well. So it put us in a pretty good position heading into winter. And I think if you have some uptick in demand from heating oil demand with some colder weather, you\u2019ll see distillate cracks respond as well. Operator : The next question is coming from John Royall of JPMorgan. John Royall : So my first question is on capital allocation. You were very aggressive on your buyback program in 3Q despite what's been a downtick in cracks. You've been pretty clear on your framework in sort of a mid-cycle and above environment. But assuming we stay in this lower margin environment, can you talk about how your approach to returning capital may or may not change in terms of that 70s or 80s percent of CFO type range that you've been in? And would you use your balance sheet a little bit at lower parts of the cycle? Jason Fraser : John, this is Jason. I'm going to ask Homer to respond to your question. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Jason. John. Yes, I mean, I think in this environment we're in and with the strength of our balance sheet, you should absolutely should continue to expect us to be in our posture. As I mentioned in the opening remarks, you can go back to start of 2021. We've been able to fund all our uses of cash, including capital. We've paid down over $4 billion of debt and returned over $18 billion to shareholders over that period, all through cash flow from operations. So turning to where we are now, let me start by reiterating that the 40% to 50% is a minimum commitment, not a target. So we're always going to honor that. As you noted, we've consistently been well above that despite the pullback in margins. And I think you can attribute that -- attribute our ability to do that because of our low-cost profile and then disciplined use of capital. So given the strength of our balance sheet and our cash position, I think you should rest comfortable that the 40% to 50% will continue to be a floor and all excess free cash flow will go towards buybacks. John Royall : Great. And then my next question is just on California. We've gotten news of a new closure out there, which all other things equal, will be a good thing for those who remain. But there are some new legislative pressures there, and you've also mentioned strategic alternatives, I think, in your 10-Q. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on how you're thinking about continuing to operate as a refinery in California and what those strategic alternatives might be. Lane Riggs : John, this is Lane. I'll let Rich start with the policy side, then I'll talk about the strategic side after the answer of the question. Richard Walsh : Okay. Yes. So it's really unclear at this time whether when and which one of these various policies that the state keeps proposing coming out of these legislations. So we'll just kind of have to we'll have to kind of see how that plays out. A lot of these are driven by a lot of political rhetoric that you see coming out of the state. And I think when we see that pass from the legislature and the political arena back over to the CEC for implementation, I think you see them struggle with a lot of these ideas. There are ideas that they sound good politically, but when you start putting them into the market realities, it has the potential to make things even more costly for consumers. So the reality is that California policy has cost the state a number of refineries and including this most recent announcement. And so you can't have policy that impairs supply and then expected to lower prices for customers. So -- and consumers. So recall, all of these regulations have a caveat in them that require the CEC to implement it only if they find that the actions will lower cost for consumers. And that's going to be the challenge for them. Lane Riggs : On strategy, we\u2019ve been consistent for over a decade, probably even longer than that in terms of our \u2013 how we manage and steward the West Coast, and it\u2019s largely driven by California policy. We\u2019ve minimized strategic CapEx, we make sure we maintain a really reliable operation through our maintenance CapEx, which in turn positions us as a core call option on West Coast cracks. With that said, California is increasing its regulatory pressure on the industry. So it\u2019s really considering everything, all options are on the table. Operator : The next question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Theresa Chen : Can you unpack some of the earlier comments on the evolution of global product supply over the more, I guess, medium to long term, taking into account the continued ramp up facilities abroad as well as planned closures in 2025. How do you think this trend? And do you expect changes in trade flows as a result? Gary Simmons : Yes, Theresa, I can try. So overall, when we look at 2025, we see about 1,040,000 barrels a day of new refining capacity coming online. And so far, there's about 740,000 barrels a day of refinery closures announced. So net-net, about a 300,000 barrel a day net capacity additions. And then forecast for total light product demand we're looking at is about an increase in 700,000 barrels a day. So for next year, really, it all comes -- and it becomes about timing. When did those refineries close, when did the new capacity come online. So it gives a lot of uncertainty into next year. Even the demand side is a little uncertain. A lot of the economic stimulus in China, how long does it take to come into effect? But we see tightening balances through next year. And then when you get past next year, you kind of have a fairly extended period where when you look at net capacity additions, and total product demand growth, there's a pretty good gap there. So we see an extended period with tighter and tighter balances around the refining margins. Theresa Chen : Helpful. And then turning to the renewables front. Would you be able to provide an update on how the SaaS unit is operating following its recent in-service and any other commercial discussions to broaden this offering as well as your views on the subsidy prices. Eric Fisher : Yes, I'd say -- this is Eric, Theresa. The SaaS startup looks great. As we said in the call, the project finished ahead of schedule from our original timing that we had for 1Q of next year and it finished under budget. So project execution for Valero once again demonstrates its exceptional ability to beat expectations. And then you expect that performance as we go into full operations. So, so far, startup looks very good. I don't think we have any doubt it's going to meet its design capability. And commercially, we're seeing a lot of interest and continued contracting of the product, both from a SBK standpoint, as well as a blended SaaS standpoint. And I don't know, Gary, if you wanted to comment on any of that. Gary Simmons : No, I\u2019m not going to go into a lot of details, but there\u2019s been some press releases with some of the airlines, Southwest, JetBlue about contracts that we\u2019ve signed. In addition to that, we\u2019re dealing with freight carriers. There\u2019s been an announcement with DHL. So I\u2019m not going to go into a lot of the commercial details there. But when we made the decision to fund the project, we said we expected it to exceed our minimum return threshold of after tax, 25%, still confident with the contracts we have in place and the volumes sold that we\u2019ll do that. Operator : The next question is coming from Doug Leggate of Wolfe Research. Douglas Leggate : Appreciate you take my questions guys. Gary, I wonder if I could go back to the balances question. I know it's an imperfect an imprecise assessment that we're all trying to make here. But I wanted to use Valero as an example. I look back, your -- obviously, your mechanical availability has been one of the hallmarks of the investment case. 2018 3rd quarter, 99%, '19, 94%. Pre-COVID '22, 95%, 95% last year. My point is that, you guys have obviously got a lot of upside to your potential utilization. And the same is probably true then of anyone who's cutting runs at this point, Singapore or whatever. So when you think about supply additions, what are you assuming for the response of a potentially oversupplied market raising utilization in some of those more challenged refineries. And I guess what I'm getting at is it not reasonable to assume we need around the refinery closures before we get back to that above mid-cycle that you were talking about. Gary Simmons : Yes. We look at historic refinery utilization rates and we look at the balances and kind of assume it's going to be in line with historic utilization rates. However, I do think you can see a lot of refining capacity in the world that's underwater, some of that is in need of a lot of capital investment. And so I think you will see additional refinery closures as well. Douglas Leggate : Okay. So I guess to be -- is that something you have any insight to? Or are you guessing. Gary Simmons : No, we can't name refineries that would close, but you can kind of see that refiners that are under pressure, some in Europe, some in the Far East. And our expectation is you'll see some additional announced closures coming. Douglas Leggate : Got it. Okay. Well, on the topic as my follow-up, if you don't mind, and that's going back to your comments about California. I mean, obviously, we've had ABX too, I guess, is it the title of it the inventory question. And it seems that when Phillips 66 shut down Rodeo, there was an equal and opposite impact from imports that seem to offset any potential tightness in the West Coast. So I guess as you look at your portfolio overall, and particularly the West Coast, how do you see the cost competitiveness? It's the only asset in the only area in your portfolio that lost money this year this past quarter. Any color you can give on how you're thinking about portfolio adjustments going forward? Lane Riggs : Doug, it\u2019s Lane. I sort of alluded to it before. It\u2019s clearly our highest cost structure operation. Historically, they had been challenged with respect to cost of crude. So if you think about OpEx the regulatory environment and the supply situation in the West Coast, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s always a challenge. And so \u2013 and it\u2019s very different than maybe some of the other areas that we operate. And again, what we\u2019ve historically done is try to position the assets to be a call option for when things get out of balance because the supply chain is so long. So with respect to these regulations, we\u2019ll just have to see what they actually finally try to do. But clearly, the California regulatory environment is putting pressure on operators out there and how they might think about going forward with their operations. Operator : The next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. I want to come back and hammer the California question as well. In the most recent 10-K and 10-Q, you put out -- you've highlighted issues with California from an asset value or an ongoing concern kind of question. With Philips closing down their unit or announcing the closure of their unit, California obviously hypersensitive about the price of fuels to consumers regardless of what their policy may do. Does it impact your ability, you think, going forward, if you have to make a hard decision on a California refining unit that someone else went first. I mean sort of -- does it invite more political interference? And how would that work? Richard Walsh : I mean, I don't know that, that really factors into our thinking necessarily. I mean I think what we would be looking at is what are the regulatory programs that California puts forward. A lot of these programs were announced. I mean the initial one, the margin cap was announced almost 2 years ago, and they've still been collecting information and studying the market. I mean I think one of the realities is there's the market is incredibly efficient until you interfere with it. And I think the California is, I think, starting to realize that as the more they interfere, the worse the situation gets. And so that's, I think the challenge there. So I think we have to wait and see what they're going to do and what they decide. I mean, it's their choice, and then we just have to react to that. And what others do, that's their decision. We have great assets out there, and we have great people operating them. So I think we like our position. Roger Read : Appreciate that. Rich, you're more of an optimist than me because I don't really believe they quite grasp all the impacts of policies in terms of the outcomes. The follow-up question, I'd just like to ask, probably to Gary, diesel demand does look like it's starting to improve here in the U.S., the last kind of, let's call it, 2 months worth -- is there anything you're seeing that in terms of DOE information, is there anything you're seeing as you look at that in a more short-term basis versus like your full year commentary on demand? Gary Simmons : I think both gasoline and diesel, we saw a little bit of demand softness, and it\u2019s picked up as the year has gone on. I mentioned over the last 2 weeks, we\u2019ve actually seen a surge. So in the last 2 weeks, we have about a 5% year-over-year increase in diesel demand kind of consistent with your comments. I think you\u2019re seeing some of that in Europe as well. You can see the 211 in Europe has gone up $2 or $3 in the last few weeks, kind of indicating that some of that topping capacity, the diesel from some of that hydroskimming topping capacity is \u2019eeded to supply the market as things are getting tight heading into winter. Operator : The next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : I apologize. First I want to add -- one question is on California also. I think Gary and Lane. Historically, that refiner doesn't just shut down the refinery just because they're not making money. But typically, we wait until there's a substantial CapEx outlay requirement, maybe a major turn on before that they're being pushed to make a hard decision. Just curious that in your Benicia refinery, can you share that what that may be the time line, say, at what point that will be the next major capital data you need to put that you will have to make a decision or that more likely than we'll make you trying to have a decision whether that is a viable ongoing business or not. Is there any you can say? Lane Riggs : Yes. Paul, this is Lane. Sorry for that. So good try. We don't normally provide outlooks with respect to our turnaround activity. But your premise is correct. I mean clearly, not only the cost structure out there is higher the cost turnarounds out there is significantly higher. And so it weighs any big outlay on turnarounds in the West Coast is in the way you think about assets going forward, it will -- and any other asset really in the world for that matter, it's largely driven by the next big capital outlay. But in terms of guidance on -- and we're going to do our next turnaround, we -- as a general policy, we just don't do that. Paul Cheng : Okay. Understand. And Europe [indiscernible] the margin capture is phenomenal. And it's interesting because I mean Europe, the market condition quite very difficult. So if the strong margin capture is really driven by your [indiscernible] refinery? Or that is -- I mean, Europe is also doing well. Just trying to help us understand -- I mean, over the past 2 or 3 years, quite [indiscernible] and then take often time surprised us on the upside. So trying to understand what's going on there. Greg Bram : Paul, it's Greg. So a couple of things that impacted the North Atlantic in the third quarter : One, we had some very good results from the commercial team that helped contribute; And then the second thing, you talked about Quebec, but really crude cost for that region. Sometimes it's Quebec, sometimes it's Pembrook but crude costs were fairly favorable. Some of that was some of the Canadian grades coming into Quebec. Some of that was just the relative value of the grades we're running versus dated Brent. And so while that market might have been challenged, remember that the capture is relative to kind of a market-based reference crack. And so we take into account where the market is at and putting that together, and we performed pretty well relative to that reference. Operator : The next question is coming from Jean Salisbury of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jean Salisbury : You referenced the growing OPEC supply next year. This primarily benefits Valero and heavy sour crude, but I believe also in some of the high sulfur intermediate margins. that you consume as feedstocks. Can you just go over the different ways that increasing OPEC supply could manifest in different markets and your exposure there? Gary Simmons : Yes. So we see several bright spots in terms of supply fundamentals around heavy sour crude. Obviously, OPEC, 180,000 barrels a day on the market starting in December. Seasonally, we expect Canadian production to ramp up as well. We think Canadian production could hit record highs over the winter. Then you have continued Venezuelan production growth, and this time of year, you get to where you're past the period of time in the Middle East where they're burning fuel oil for power generation. So all that puts more barrels on the market. If you get into the first quarter and Lyondell shuts down, it takes some demand as way as well. So those things should be positive in terms of quality discounts. Operator : The next question is coming from Joe Laetsch of Morgan Stanley. Joe Laetsch : So I wanted to go back to the RD side, and it continues to be a tougher margin environment for the industry overall to margins recently. As we look towards 2025, could you just talk to how you're thinking about the moving pieces around credits, including RINs, LCFS prices as well as feedstock costs as it relates to profitability? Eric Fisher : Sure. This is Eric. The -- it looks like a lot of good tailwinds start in 2025. So California intends to approve their LCFS modifications November 8, with the intent of starting that Jan 1, that should tighten the credit bank through 2025 and increase LCFS prices. You've got that. You've got Europe and U.K. starting their fit for 55 which starts the SAF mandate of 2% in that region. We're watching the Canadian B.C. election very closely to see what they do with the CFR, but nationally, that will still be in play in 2025. And all these obligations naturally ratchet as you go into next year. And then lastly, the IRA with the switch from the blenders tax credit to the production tax credit does create a lot of tailwind for us because that will switch from $1 for everyone to a CI base where we're the most advantaged and it does not allow importers to qualify for the credit. So if you look at those two benefits of the IRA, that is a good tailwind for DGD. Those things are all on paper that's waiting for a lot of policy clarification between now and the end of the year. But the one thing we look at is that is the policy intent of all those programs. And most of those take legislative action to change. And so that, we think, will be difficult and that means those policies will probably go forward as designed at least initially. So we're all waiting on seeing how that develops in the next couple of months. I think the whole renewables segment is all asking for this guidance to be given so that we can move forward with plans. But all of that looks pretty constructive. On the feedstock side, we've mostly seen prices equilibrate. There was previously a lot of advantage in foreign feedstocks. We've seen that largely equilibrate. We've seen the market really level out a lot of the price lag we've talked about for the last several months has evened out. So I think what you're seeing is the world is recognizing that waste oils are still the most advantaged. Our partnership with Darling still gives us the most advantaged access to domestic feedstock and some of their foreign feedstock that they now produce out of South America and Europe, all of that looks advantaged. And as we see vegetable oil and BD are going to be marginal going forward, and that will set a floor in this whole space. So as the blenders tax credit goes away, BD will be significantly underwater without an adjustment to the RINs. So the last piece that I think is positive is the expectation that RINs will have to go up to offset the loss that BD and vegetable oil RD takes as we migrate to the PTC. So that -- there's a lot of expectation that RINs will increase. That won't happen overnight, but if that does, it is a significant tailwind to DGD and RD. Joe Laetsch : Great. there. And then I just wanted to ask on the naphtha side, specifically, exports out of the Gulf Coast has been strong in the past couple of months, which I think has been supportive of margins. What are you seeing on your side? And how are you thinking about the outlook for naphtha here? Gary Simmons : Yes. So I think there\u2019s a couple of things driving the relative strength in naphtha. Some of that is with the economic run cuts of some of the hydroskimmers, you see less naphtha in the market. So U.S. Gulf Coast supply has had a step in for that. But we\u2019re also seeing a bit of a pickup for petrochemical demand for naphtha, which looks to be improving. And so that\u2019s also creating some of the export opportunities. So we expect it to continue. Operator : The next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe what I know -- Lane, I know how much you love to talk about the concept of capture rate, but has been -- for the entire sector, it's kind of been steadily declining over the last 18 months. And some of that obviously is just that level of margins coming down. But can you maybe talk about some of the things that have been headwinds? And then what needs to happen to see improvements on that? And is it is it absolute margins, wider crude differentials, crude backwardation, secondary product pricing improvement. Any signs of encouragement as you look into the fourth quarter of 2025 in terms of maybe improvements in margin capture. Lane Riggs : Yes. Ryan, it's Lane. I fortunately I get to hand this off to Greg. Greg Bram : Ryan, so I think you noted most of the key factors, and we've talked about some of them already. Crude market backwardation certainly has been a bit persistent and strong here, particularly late in 2024 that's certainly a factor. In fact, I think if you look back in early 2023, we're actually in contango. So there's no doubt that continuing on an ongoing basis is not something you would necessarily expect. So seeing improvement there will help capture. Thinking about us, in particular, we've talked about heavy maintenance a number of quarters here recently. So that's definitely a factor more in some regions than others. I mean, there's always going to be some maintenance in our system industry as well. So I think there have been some heavier periods though that have had some impact. And then you mentioned secondary products. I think the ones that really come to mind there are those related to pet chem, so things like propylene and naphtha. And Gary just talked about it. As we're seeing pet chem start to improve expect those values to improve as well, and that's going to have some positive impact on capture. Ryan Todd : Great. And then maybe one follow-up on some of your earlier comments on sustainable aviation fuel. As we think about -- I mean the message over the last couple of years late into this, I think there was clearly an expectation that the market -- the SAF market was going to be undersupplied which was going to be good for you guys. There's been a lot of moving pieces in that. Do you still view the market over the next 12 to 24 months as undersupplied? And then as you think about you're probably one of the few domestic producers that can qualify to sell into Europe. How do you think about the potential optionality of being able to sell into Europe versus kind of domestic markets and pricing here? Eric Fisher : Yes, this is Eric. I think our view is consistent that the market is physically undersupplied, given the ramp in mandates that is occurring over the next year to 5 years. You\u2019re absolutely correct. Europe will be the most attractive market, and we do have capability of supplying into that market. That will be one of our primary outlets as we start up. But I think the policies are always, as I mentioned before, we\u2019re waiting for a lot of clarification there. The mandate in Europe is very clear how that will be implemented is waiting on a lot of clarity on guidance for import codes and what duties are affecting it, all these kind of details that make \u2013 finishing the contract difficult, but we see that as all solvable between now and the end of the year for January 1 compliance. And I think in the U.S., the IRA clearly favors staff over RD from a credit standpoint. Again, we're waiting for clarity on that and as well as a lot of our customers and blenders are waiting for clarity so that we can get the contract language perfected. But all of that is moving forward, and we\u2019re confident that\u2019s going to get solved contractually especially once we get clarity on this policy guidance. Operator : The next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : The first question is just around operating expenses. It's always been a hallmark of Valero is your ability to keep that OpEx low per barrel. Just your perspective on how some of those moving pieces as we move into the next couple of years and how you're thinking about it even geographically as well. Greg Bram : Neil, it's Greg. So we keep those expenses under control. It's one of the things we focus on every day. A couple of parts, I think, that are probably notable. Energy costs have been low natural gas driving that. That's been a help. And so it looks like those prices will move back towards kind of middle of the cycle kind of range here, at least that's what folks are thinking, but that's been helpful. Inflation has made it a bit harder. We've seen the effects of that on both maintenance costs, catalyst chemicals, those kinds of things. We work hard with our partners to try to make sure we keep those costs competitive. And so as inflation moderates, we'd expect to see some of that improve as well. Those are probably the two biggest parts to think about and really the things we focus on every day. Neil Mehta : Yes. Yes. Understood on the energy side. And then the other one is on just on the Port Arthur coker. I think when you FID-ed, you talked about $325 million of EBITDA. And then you talked about it actually run rating closer to $400 million. How do you think -- as you think about that project specifically about, one, the current economics and then how those economics could evolve as you think about the path back to mid-cycle? Greg Bram : Yes, Neil, I think we still see that project giving us the returns consistent with what we showed at FID. The current market is a little different than where we started. We got real good benefits earlier this year when we did the turnaround on the old coker and we expected to see some strong value there. So I don\u2019t think anything has changed in our view. And then again, obviously, that project is hinged on being able to run a lot of heavy sour crude and upgraded to light products. And so as those sour differentials move around, that\u2019s going to give us a chance to capture some more value. Operator : The next question is coming from Matthew Blair of TPH. Matthew Blair : If I heard correctly, I think the $4.7 million ethanol volume guidance for Q4 might be an all-time record. And just coming at a time when ethanol margins are really crumbling on paper. So could you help us reconcile that? Is that a function of increasing net export opportunities or maybe there's the lag we should be thinking about on the ethanol indicator? Eric Fisher : Yes, it's Eric. We have increased our ethanol production capability this year. Most of this year has been pretty positive for that expanded capability. We have also expanded our export markets. Again, talking about policy, there's interest in U.S. ethanol, especially a lot of our ISCC qualified ethanol in Europe. We also see that because of U.S. corn being the most attractive feedstock in the U.S. with the largest carryout, one of the largest harvest we've ever seen, it is giving a lot of opportunity for ethanol exports. So that's what we're seeing as increased demand. We're seeing new markets for E10 in the world, and we see Brazil is increasing its ethanol mandate as well as the SaaS mandate beginning in '25. So we've grown our capacity in anticipation of a lot of this expanded interest globally in ethanol. Matthew Blair : Sounds good. And then there's been more chatter lately about just increasing global tariffs and exports are a big part of the outlet for U.S. refiners. So when you hear about the potential for just [indiscernible] increases in tariffs, what do you think, is that a concern going forward? Richard Walsh : This is Rich Walsh. I\u2019ll take an effort to add that. I mean, when you look at those tariffs, a lot of times, they\u2019re really focused around manufactured goods. Most countries don\u2019t want to increase their cost of energy that they\u2019re trying to take in. So when you think about targets for tariffs, they normally don\u2019t really wrap around energy. And so I don\u2019t know that we see the concerns on that. Operator : The next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : I wanted to circle back on the financial framework, and you provided some helpful comments about the return of capital metrics being a firm target. And I'm wondering how you think about using the balance sheet in a downturn. You have this $4 billion kind of target for cash for the balance sheet. Is that what you want headed into a downturn so you could lean on the balance sheet a bit more should the market weaken? Jason Fraser : Yes. This is Jason. I'll be glad to share some of our thoughts about cash. And our targeted cash balance will depend on the environment we're in, but in a normalized environment, we like to keep a cash balance between $4 billion to $5 billion as a guideline. And as you know, cash to move around a lot in any quarter due to things like working capital, but we're not going to hoard cash. So I think directionally, you should expect our cash balance to trend down a little from here. I'd also like to note, if it wasn't for the positive impact from working capital this quarter, we would have drawn cash by over $200 million. We also had strong buybacks for the quarter of $565 million without leaning on the balance sheet. But to answer your question more directly, yes, you're right, that $4 billion gives us a lot more room and flexibility in the downturn to continue our approach to buybacks. So I think that's correct. It's a big factor in coming out with a $4 billion number. Jason Gabelman : Great. And then the other just on the market. We've noticed a pretty strong product exports for gasoline and diesel, out of the U.S., and it's coming as fracs have fallen a bit here the past months. And so it seems like prices are needing to fall to clear the U.S. market and keep U.S. inventories kind of at healthy levels. Is that a fair interpretation of what's going on in the market where there's kind of a push from the U.S. on product exports rather than a pull from international sources on those products? Gary Simmons : Well, it's a good question. It would appear that what you're saying is correct. But in the face of that, gasoline inventories are really pretty low. We're $10 million below where we were last year. You are below the 5-year average. So the inventories wouldn't indicate a need to push. It would almost seem like it's more of a pull, and we're getting an export premium, and that's why the barrels are flowing. Jason Gabelman : Okay. And when you say you're getting an export premium, you're able to sell to international markets at a higher price than what you're selling at on, say, the U.S. Gulf Coast? Gary Simmons : Yes, we are. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Bhullar for closing comments. Homer Bhullar : Thank you, Donna. We appreciate everyone joining us today. As always, please feel free to contact the IR team if you have any additional questions. Have a great day, everyone. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance. Thank you. You may begin. Homer Bhullar : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With me today are Lane Riggs, our Chairman, CEO and President; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and COO; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted financial metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our earnings release and filings with the SEC. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lane, for opening remarks. Lane Riggs : Thank you, Homer, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by highlighting some of our team\u2019s accomplishments last year. 2024 was our best year for personnel and process safety and one of our best years for environmental performance. Safe and reliable operations drive overall performance and disciplined operations. In refining, we processed a record volume of heavy sour crude in the fourth quarter. This demonstrates our refining systems flexibility and highlights the capability of our commercial and operations teams to be able to secure and process the most economic crude oils. Finally, we set a record for ethanol production with the expansion of the Charles City plant and process optimization in other sites. Our team\u2019s relentless focus on operational excellence and low cost operations enabled us to deliver positive results in the fourth quarter in an otherwise weak margin environment. On the strategic front, we continue to deliver on our commitment to grow Valero\u2019s earnings capacity through organic investments. The DGD Sustainable Aviation Fuel project was successfully started up in the fourth quarter and is now fully operational. Looking ahead, we are progressing with an FCC Unit Optimization project at St. Charles that will enable the refinery to increase the yield of high value products including high-octane alkylate. The project is estimated to cost $230 million and is expected to start up in 2026. And, we continue to pursue other short cycle high return optimization projects around our existing refining assets. On the financial side, we continue to honor our commitment to shareholder returns with a strong payout ratio of 78% for the year. And earlier this month, our Board approved a 6% increase in the quarterly cash dividend further demonstrating our strong financial position. Looking ahead, refining margins should be supported by low light product inventories ahead of the driving season. And longer-term, we still expect product demand to exceed supply with the announced refinery shutdowns this year and the limited capacity additions beyond 2025 supporting long-term refining fundamentals. So with that, Homer, I\u2019ll hand it back to you. Homer Bhullar : Thanks, Lane.

The effective tax rate was 19% for 2024. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. Included in this amount was $119 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities associated with the other joint venture member share of DGD. Excluding this item, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $951 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 was $6.7 billion. Included in this amount was a $795 million favorable change in working capital and $371 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities associated with the other joint venture member share of DGD. Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $5.5 billion in 2024. Regarding investing activities, we made $547 million of capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2024, of which $452 million was for sustaining the business including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and the balance was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member share of DGD and other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $515 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 $1.9 billion for the year. Moving to financing activities, we returned $601 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2024, of which $339 million was paid as dividends and $262 million was for the purchase of approximately 2 million shares of common stock resulting in a payout ratio of 63% for the quarter. In 2024, we returned $4.3 billion to stockholders consisting of $2.9 billion in stock buybacks and $1.4 billion in dividends, resulting in a payout ratio of 78% for the year. In fact, since the start of 2021, our total cash flow from operations have exceeded our total uses of cash over this period, including capital investments. During this time, we\u2019ve delivered over $4 billion of debt reduction and returned approximately $18.7 billion to stockholders through dividends and share buybacks. Through share repurchases, we reduced our share count by approximately 6% in 2024 and by 23% since year-end 2021. With respect to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $8.1 billion of total debt, $2.4 billion of finance lease obligations and $4.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Debt to capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 17% as of December 31, 2024. And, we ended the quarter well-capitalized with $5.3 billion of available liquidity excluding cash. Turning to guidance, we expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2025 to be approximately $2 billion which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts, regulatory compliance and joint venture investments. About $1.6 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and the balance to growth. For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges : Gulf Coast at 1.72 million to 1.77 million barrels per day, Mid Continent at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 190,000 to 210,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 455,000 to 475,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.95 per barrel. With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2025. Operating expenses in 2025 should be $0.51 per gallon, which includes $0.22 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.6 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.41 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $130 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $710 million. For 2025, we expect G&A expenses to be approximately $985 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, please limit each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question is coming from John Royall of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. John Royall : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question is maybe to Gary, just broadly on market color. You\u2019ve always given us a good view of the fundamental picture in the sector. How do you view the supply demand balances today for products and the outlook for cracks for this year? And, what do you think are the key things we should look out for in terms of just any early indicators of when this market might turn back up? Gary Simmons : Yes John, it\u2019s always difficult to get much of a read on the market this early. I\u2019ll tell you that we typically see our sales through our wholesale channel dip fairly significantly through the holiday season, kind of goes through the first couple of weeks of the year then starts to recover. We saw that same dynamic this year, sales kind of dipped to about 85% of average. The last couple of weeks we\u2019ve seen a nice recovery back to kind of, a 1 million barrels a day level that we typically see. I think yesterday we did 1,040,000 barrels a day. Gasoline sales in our system year-to-date are slightly down year-over-year. I think when you look at the concentration of our marketing this makes sense. The snow in the south and southeast kept people off the road and then the Colonial Pipeline outage limited our volumes we had available to sell in some markets. For that window the pipeline was down. Our current 7-day average data shows gasoline sales up 2% year-over-year. Overall what we can see is gasoline demand looks good and we expect gasoline demand in the United States to be fairly flat to last year. Diesel sales year-to-date in our system are also off a few percent. This was a little more surprising to me mainly because of the cold weather that we\u2019ve seen. But, I think if you look into the data a little bit more it makes sense. We had about 10,000 barrels a day of Renewable Diesel from Port Arthur that was going to our wholesale channel that we were selling. That material is now going to produce sustainable aviation fuel. So, that\u2019s a chunk in the year-over-year decline in diesel sales. In addition to that, we saw the same dynamic on diesel with some of the snow impacting on-road diesel demand. And then, I think if you look at Valero, we don\u2019t have a big marketing presence in the markets where you see high heating oil demand. So, we don\u2019t really see that big uplift from the cold weather that you may see. We definitely get that on the bulk side but not through wholesale. 7-day average shows diesel sales are up about 1% and that\u2019s kind of what we expect for the year about a 1% increase in diesel demand in the United States. Most consultants I\u2019ve read are showing about a 250,000 barrel a day increase in diesel demand just due to cold weather in the North Atlantic Basin. Not only do we expect diesel demand to be better but we expect a greater percentage of that to be supplied by refinery derived diesel. Last year we had the big wave of bio and renewable diesel projects hitting the market. We don\u2019t see that same dynamic this year. So, I think overall things are shaping up pretty nicely. We\u2019re at total light product inventory 9 million, 10 million barrels below where we were last year at this time. So, inventory is in good place. I think at the beginning of the year the supply demand balances look similar to last year, but as you progress through the year you\u2019ll see gradual tightening of supply demand balances. John Royall : Great. It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Gary. And then, my second question is on capital allocation. You finished the year with another quarter well above your 40% to 50% floor and high-70s for the full year. But assuming we don\u2019t have a significant recovery in cracks from here, how should we think about that payout ratio in a lower crack environment in \u201825? Should we expect you to move closer to that 40% to 50% floor? Jason Fraser : Good morning, John. This is Jason. I\u2019m going to ask Homer to give you a little more detail on that. Homer Bhullar : Sure. Yes, John, I mean, you\u2019re right. We had a 78% payout for the year, but that was partly funded by our excess cash balance going into the year. But, if you want to put this into context with some numbers, if we had held our shareholder payout ratio at 50% for the year, we would have built almost $1.7 billion of cash for the year. Even if you excluded the $795 million of positive impact for working capital for the year and include the $167 million debt repayment we did in the first quarter of 2024, we would have still built over $700 million of cash. Now taking that a bit further, even if you look at the low margin environment in the fourth quarter, we still would have been able to honor our minimum payout commitment of 40% to 50% without leaning into the balance sheet or drawing down cash. So, hopefully this gives you some context of the earnings capacity of the portfolio even in a low margin environment and our ability to invest capital obviously honor our shareholder commitment and flexibility with debt in our balance sheet. John Royall : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Doug Leggate of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Thanks guys. I think Gary, you might be the most popular man in the call today, Lane, I apologize, but there is obviously a lot going on. Lane Riggs : That\u2019s okay, with me Doug. Doug Leggate : So, I got to try just a couple of, someone has got to do it. I am going to try a couple of high-level ones if I may. The headlines I saw just a couple of hours ago was that Trump is still going to go ahead with tariffs on Canada. And, I seem to recall that the last time there were problems with heavy oil supply at Canada, there was a second order effect that everyone seems to have forgotten about. And, I wanted to run this past year and just get your perspective on it. And that is that, if you need to find a substitute for that much heavy oil, you\u2019re going to have run cuts, you\u2019re going to have utilization yield issues funding your system and so on. And, I wanted to see if you guys thought there was any sense to that in the context of actually became a thing as it relates to the substitution of lighter crude and some heavy grades. What would you guys do? Gary Simmons : Yes, so Doug this is Gary. And, I can tell you we\u2019ve been aware of this for a couple of months and so our commercial teams and optimization teams have been working hard to develop every possible scenario we can think of and how we would respond to that. Of course it\u2019s why we like our position on the U.S. Gulf Coast because you can source feedstocks from anywhere around the world and where we also like our feedstock flexibility. But yes, there is a point where if heavy feedstocks become limited, it affects rate and production of clean products certainly from our assets and we\u2019d expect industry-wide. Doug Leggate : So, presuming this, assuming this is transit rate is not a big deal, but if it did drag on for an extended period of time, particularly as we switch into summer grade, I mean could it be meaningful or is that a rounding error? Gary Simmons : Greg, you want to? Yes. Greg Bram : Hey, Doug, this is Greg. Yes, when we think about it and look at some of those different scenarios, you might see a 10% change in throughput. A lot depends on how far it goes and how deep you have to back off on some of those heavy barrels. But, it wouldn\u2019t be driving things to a much greater degree than that, I don\u2019t think. Doug Leggate : Okay. I want to start meaningfully enough when you were talking about the situation you got right now. So, we\u2019re searching for green shoots, that\u2019s really what these questions are about. So I apologize I\u2019m going to try another high-level one and it really relates to your throughput guidance. So obviously everyone is focused on whether it does focus or Lyondell closing or Grangemouth or whatever it happens to be. But it seems to me that coming out of COVID, utilization rates, the concentration or the absence of good maintenance got solved and the concentration of great maintenance meant everybody run well. And, it seems to us with no storms and all the things you run through, Gary, there are probably about 3% or 4% of utilization that was kind of a best-in-class world for the U.S. last year, which is basically four refineries if you think about it. And so, when I look at your guidance for the quarter, you obviously don\u2019t give forward cadence for commercial reasons through the rest of the year. But at a high-level, how do you see the likelihood that the industry, the U.S. industry specifically can continue to run at those kind of levels given the backdrop we\u2019ve had and the fact that we\u2019re down 10% in the last three weeks in utilization? Gary Simmons : Yes. So, I think certainly what you\u2019ve seen utilization in the last few weeks is somewhat weather related along with the maintenance activity. I think given the advantages that U.S. refiners enjoy on feedstock cost and energy cost, you should expect to see that U.S. refining continues to run at higher utilization rates and when you have run cuts, they occur elsewhere in the world where they don\u2019t have the natural resources advantages that we have. Doug Leggate : I think I was thinking more about the reliability aspect as opposed to the cost advantage aspect? Gary Simmons : Yes, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve certainly seen an improvement in our system on mechanical availability and I suspect our peers have as well and it\u2019s something we always strive to get better and better at. Doug Leggate : Great. All right, guys, sorry for the high-level questions. But I\u2019ve had my two, so I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks so much. Gary Simmons : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Yes. Good morning, team. Just a couple of questions on the quarter itself. Renewable Diesel performance came in I think better than what most market participants were expecting and better than implied by the indicators. So, just curious on any thoughts there and the outlook for that business as we work our way through 2025? Eric Fisher : Yes, this is Eric. I think a lot, there was a one-time benefit with some inventory optimization at the end of the year that was the bulk of that higher than expected performance. There is a little bit of SAF in that, but I would make it clear that that was mostly some inventory optimization we did at the end of the year. In terms of forward-looking in Renewable Diesel and SAF for us, we are all kind of waiting to see how this market is going to develop and how the policy is going to develop. But overall, things are very much staying in-line with kind of what we thought was going to happen. The 45Z has now replaced the blender\u2019s tax credit. We can see that that\u2019s now going to limit product imports into the U.S. It is going to make it a carbon intensity scale rather than a flat dollar to every renewable product. All of that is advantageous to Diamond Green Diesel and our platform because like the refining platform, our feedstock flexibility, our ability to export to any of the other markets. And, I think consistent with our outlook from last year, the most attractive markets are going to be in Europe and Canada compared to U.S. and California. So overall, we\u2019re waiting to see how RINS are going to respond, how LCFS is going to respond. And, I think you will see those changes emerging in the market in the next couple of months as some of those production and credit reports emerge on how the year ended. Gary already mentioned that we don\u2019t see any increase in renewable production this year. It\u2019s still long compared to say D3 RIN credit bank or D4 RIN credit banks and LCFS credit banks but we do also expect you\u2019re going to see some correction in production that will eventually start to pull those credit banks down throughout the year. Neil Mehta : That\u2019s helpful. And then, independent of tariffs it was notable the amount of heavy that you were able to run through the system. And I think there were some concerns about coking economics in the quarter given how tight fuel oil was, but clearly you were able to optimize the system to run over 600,000 barrels a day of heavy sour oil. So can you just talk about how you were able to do that and the commercial approach to maximizing heavy in a time when fuel oil is pretty tight? Greg Bram : Hey, Neil, this is Greg. I\u2019ll start and then Gary can talk some more about the market. But, you hit on I think the key factor which is as the fuel oil prices, those differentials narrowed that with fuel oil typically being a feedstock in our Gulf Coast system, we pivoted away from that towards the heavy crudes as an alternative, which continued to show some good value. So, that\u2019s why you see that shift towards more heavy sour crude. You also notice a reduction on the heavy resid feedstocks that we\u2019ve processed as well. And that\u2019s kind of how we got to the high-level of heavy crude processing. Also keep in mind, we\u2019ve got the Port Arthur coker online that shifts us to a bit of a heavier feed slate as well. So, that\u2019s part of what you see in that number as well. Neil Mehta : Thanks you. Operator : Would you like to move on to the next question? Greg Bram : Yes, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. On the tariff topic specifically, understanding that you\u2019re not captive to any specific source of crude based on your footprint and the optionality you have on the Gulf Coast. But as we think about the tariff on Canada, Mexico incremental sanctions potentially on Venezuela, how are you thinking about light heavy differentials as we move through the year? Gary Simmons : Yes, Theresa, this is Gary. I think I\u2019ll start with kind of fundamentals but then cut to really what\u2019s driving the market and certainly on the fundamental side typically this time of year you see less buying of medium and heavy sours just due to turnaround activity. In addition to that, Lyondell coming down puts another 200,000 barrels a day heavy on the market. Calls for OPEC crude, second quarter 2025 180,000 barrels a day of medium sour crude. So, all those things would be supportive of water quality differentials, but in reality the discussions on sanctions and tariffs are really what\u2019s driving the market and until we see some resolution to that, I don\u2019t expect any meaningful moves in the quality differentials. Theresa Chen : Understood. And, related to the St. Charles FCC project, would you be able to provide a little bit more color on this, what the optimization means in terms of incremental improvement in the yield of high value products? Greg Bram : Sure, Theresa, it\u2019s Greg. Lane mentioned it costs about $230 million. It definitely meets our investment hurdle at mid-cycle pricing. And, one of the key outcomes for the project is increasing the production of light olefin product out of the FCC. And, what that really means is that\u2019s additional feedstock we can use to fill the alkylation capacity we have downstream of the FCC there. You might remember we started up a C5 alkylation unit at St. Charles back in late 2020 and with some tweaks and optimizations we\u2019ve done to that unit since. We\u2019ve got some spare capacity in the alky and with this project, you will increase high-octane alkylate production by something on the order of 6,000 to 7,000 barrels a day. That\u2019s one of the key outcomes and the things that drive the value. It\u2019s really a good example of identifying some key equipment constraints within the operation that when we modify those constraints of that equipment, allows us to take full advantage of the capability not only of the FCC unit in this case, but other equipment and other units in the refinery and again in this case the alky and that\u2019s how we generate a good return from the project. Theresa Chen : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Manav Gupta of UBS. Please go ahead. Manav Gupta : Good morning. I wanted some additional color on the North Atlantic capture. Looks like it jumped from 102% last quarter to about 118% and similarly the Gulf Coast capture jumped from about 76% to 86%. So Gary, if you could help us out a little, what were the some of the factors helping you drive that kind of capture improvement? Gary Simmons : Sure. I\u2019ll let Greg answer. Greg Bram : Hey, Manav. A couple of things I\u2019d point out on the North Atlantic, really it\u2019s a bit of a system question. So, it\u2019s North Atlantic and Gulf Coast as well, but we go into the wintertime, we start blending more butane into the higher RVP gasoline. That gives us a bit of a bump in capture as that adds value into the gasoline pool. In both those regions as well, you had good contributions from the wholesale side of the business, the commercial parts. So, we saw some benefit from that. On the Gulf Coast, the other notable item would really be, if you look at Maya relative to the Canadian grades that we use for the benchmark, Maya was a bit more discounted. Certainly, when you look at it quarter-over-quarter, and so that helped you improve the crude cost that we saw for the heavy crudes into the Gulf Coast. Manav Gupta : Quick follow-up here is, we are seeing a very strong diesel margin and slightly weaker gasoline and I know Valero can move the yield around a lot. So, are you already operating in max diesel mode or how much more can you swing the yield more towards diesel or do you think this is very temporary like once you come February and March the gasoline demand will improve and the cracks will start to balance out each other? Greg Bram : Manav, this is Greg. Yes, we are definitely in max diesel mode. As you mentioned the cracks would drive us in that direction and we\u2019ll see as we get into gasoline season whether the gas crack shifts enough to push us the other way. Manav Gupta : Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : The next question is coming from Paul Sankey of Sankey Research. Please go ahead. Paul Sankey : Hi, everyone. Just continuing on the themes that we\u2019ve had this morning. Can you talk a bit about the Atlantic basin and all the trade arbitrages? And, I think it\u2019s obviously tough to make a firm\u2019s outlook here with all that\u2019s moving around. But, I wondered what have you been seeing, let\u2019s say over the past two months to six months in terms of the major new Nigerian refinery. There\u2019s been a lot of action in the dollar versus the euro. There\u2019s obviously been all the cold weather effects. So, I just wondered if you could describe a little bit what we\u2019ve been seeing in the market in the Atlantic Basin and what your outlook is for the coming year? Thanks a lot. Tough question. Gary Simmons : Yes, so I\u2019ll start with the Dangote Refinery. I think, from what we can see and what we read they do have their resid FCC up and running. We see that commercially. They\u2019re not offering out the fuel oil or the resid that we were buying from them. We also see less imports of gasoline into West Africa which is all consistent with Dangote continuing to ramp up. With that though, however, what we\u2019ve seen is that generally tends to impact Europe more than it does the U.S. gasoline that was going to West Africa gets backed into Europe. We haven\u2019t really seen much of an impact from that. Our gasoline exports primarily go to Latin America. You can see in the fourth quarter, we were 98,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports into that market, which is consistent of where we\u2019ve been. I can tell you in the first quarter, we\u2019re right about that same level again. Diesel has been somewhat interesting. The cold weather in the U.S. kind of has the U.S. market strong, so you actually see a few cargos from Europe actually booked in the New York Harbor, which is an abnormal trade flow. We do see that correcting when you get to the second half of February. We\u2019re already seeing an open arb to export back from the U.S. to Europe. So, nothing too abnormal on trade flows. I think by and large what you\u2019ve seen is that the Dangote startup in the North Atlantic Basin has been largely offset with Lyondell coming down and Grangemouth coming down and they\u2019re kind of counterbalancing each other and keeping trade flows about what we\u2019ve seen historically. Paul Sankey : That\u2019s brilliant. Thanks very much. And just, if I could follow-up, thinking about the reality of tariffs, could you describe maybe a situation of how they would work? I mean what happens? Do you just suddenly have to stop paying it overnight or how does it work? If you\u2019ve got any ideas, I\u2019d be grateful. Thanks. Gary Simmons : Without having really any clarity on what\u2019s going to happen, there\u2019s no reason for us there, no way we can really speculate on how we deal with it. We\u2019re just going to have to deal with it when it comes up. Lane Riggs : Hey Paul, it\u2019s Lane. All I add is, I mean it depends on the market, right. If you\u2019re a captive market, they\u2019re going to, it will somehow get shared between the refinery and say the Canadian crude producer because there\u2019s some captive markets in the Mid Continent. In the Gulf Coast, somehow that will all ultimately get sort of priced in depending on what how the refiners configured and what their alternatives are and then we\u2019ll just have to see how long it lasts. Paul Sankey : Got it. Have there been examples of it happening in the past that you can think of where you suddenly have to pay 25% more for a given crude? Lane Riggs : No, and I\u2019ve been around a long time. Paul Sankey : Got you. I think that, Lane. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read : All right. Lane, I\u2019m still chuckling from, you\u2019ve been around a long time answer there. Maybe coming back a little bit on the whole changing in capacity, so obviously you mentioned the shutdown of Grangemouth. We had to shut down here locally of Lyondell and we have some more stuff likely coming in Europe beyond what\u2019s been announced. I\u2019m just curious how you all are seeing some of those dynamics play out in terms of just crude availability, let\u2019s leave the tariff thing aside and maybe how that\u2019s playing out along the Gulf Coast? Gary Simmons : Yes, so I think the only thing we can see is you\u2019ve definitely seen the dynamic in the market of Lyondell stopping to buy and they were buying a lot of especially a lot of Canadian. And so, we\u2019ve seen more of those barrels become available to us as they backed off the market. Roger Read : Does that materially change price or is it just an availability question? Gary Simmons : It\u2019s so difficult to tell because it\u2019s been going along at the same time with all these tariffs and sanctions discussions. So, it\u2019s kind of those discussions have muted any market impact there would be of Lyondell pushing the barrels back so far. Roger Read : Okay. And then, as a follow-up question from earlier about I think Doug was asking it about the industry\u2019s ability to maintain utilization as you look forward through the year thinking about some of these closures that have happened. And, if you look at on a year-over-year change of U.S. inventories, whether you look at crude alone or crude plus products or just products, all are down year-over-year, little more severe on the crude side than on the product side, but it would imply a lot of tightness. And if you can\u2019t, I\u2019d say if you can, if the industry cannot maintain these levels of utilization, it would imply either much lower inventories or lower exports, but is there anything I\u2019m missing in that general thought process? Gary Simmons : No, I think you\u2019ve got it nail on the head. When we look at the balances, the inherent assumption that you\u2019re going to see similar supply demand balance as the last year and gradually tightening is the fact that the industry at a high actual utilization is going to go up to meet demand. And so, that certainly we haven\u2019t had a major weather event the last year. Any kind of a major weather event to knock capacity offline or unreliability event can tighten things up a lot. If you look we\u2019re especially on the diesel side we\u2019re within 10% on inventory where we were in 2023. In 2023 we had a $45 diesel crack versus where it is today. I mean the inventory position is not significantly different if the margin environment is fairly significantly different. It could change in a hurry. Roger Read : Appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe a couple of follow ups on the biofuel side. I mean, you talked some about your, like the broader 2025 outlook with all the moving pieces there. As we think about the early part of this year, like first quarter in particular, PTC goes away December 31. It feels like it\u2019s going to take some time, at least a few months for the market to kind of meet you in equilibrium with the 45Z and some of the impacts on imports and domestic production. Is there a risk to like first how does this play out in the first quarter? Is there a risk that economics kind of fall off the table in the first quarter as this stuff gets sorted before it reaches kind of a better equilibrium later on in the year? Eric Fisher : Yes, I think if you look at the conversion of the PTC where everyone got a dollar to now this carbon intensity based credit, we\u2019ve run the U.S. credit model that was just released. For veg oil that\u2019s zero for canola oil, it\u2019s $0.16 for soybean oil and waste oils are in the $0.50 to $0.60 per gallon range. And so, at the end of the day that is all less than a dollar. So, if you needed that dollar to breakeven and now you\u2019re getting $0.16 it\u2019s a fairly negative margin environment for non-waste oils. I think everyone can see that. I think there\u2019s growing recognition that this is going to be very difficult to see a lot of the biodiesel side and veg oil side operate at these lower incentives. How that plays out in terms of production reconciliation through the first quarter, everyone\u2019s looking to see well, but hand-in-hand we also see the imports that were coming to the U.S. to get that dollar are now stopped. So, how will that balance out? We haven\u2019t seen a lot of change in feedstock prices to reflect a lot of this, but I think there\u2019s great recognition that there\u2019s going to be some movement in overall production and overall feedstock prices kind of as you go through the first quarter and see some of these early reports coming in on what are we seeing in terms of generation of credits. And so again I think being a waste oil unit on the Gulf Coast we\u2019re the most advantaged in terms of how we can react to these things and it still mostly favors waste oils which our platform is based on. So, I think we\u2019re still in a good position versus our competitors. It\u2019s just but there\u2019s no doubt overall there\u2019s lower incentive for all of this in this PTC world. Ryan Todd : Thanks. And then, maybe a follow-up on SAF. I mean can you maybe just provide a little bit of an update in terms of your SAF operations at this point, maybe some idea of level of production and how you think about the contribution of SAF economics there in 2025? Eric Fisher : Yes. So, as Lane mentioned this in his opening comments, the project started up in the fourth quarter. Again, credit to our project team on finishing ahead of schedule and under budget. We had a flawless start up. It started up on spec. We spent most of the time in the fourth quarter doing test runs and initial fills on tanks. But throughout all our test run trials, we showed a very wide range of operability, all of which more than met our project goals operationally. So, unit hardware looks great, production has been very smooth and we made our first sales in November and we saw the QA/QC and all of the traceability and accreditation flow all the way from production to neat SAF to blended SAF to delivery to final customer. And so, we spent a lot of time in the fourth quarter just sort of proving the system out. In terms of going forward, we\u2019re not going to really get into a lot of detail because what I\u2019d say is what we have now is very good flexibility to meet all the project economic goals and that we set out with the original project. But if you look at say the Argus market in the EU and the U.K., right now you see HBO at or better than SAF. So, we have flexibility to make either barrel into the European market and so really what we\u2019re doing now is just tuning that optimization as we see SAF customers really starting up in the first quarter because of the 2% mandate that you see in the EU and U.K. Ryan Todd : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Hey guys, good morning. Lane Riggs : Good morning. Paul Cheng : Maybe this is, I want to go back to Eric. The PTC, I don\u2019t think that the detail is out. So, when you guys report the first quarter, should we just assume that in your gross margin the PTC is also that you will drop by $1 per gallon, but you\u2019re not going to recall any benefit or that you would put some kind of provision or anything that you would just come through? And also, whether that you can share how much is the fourth quarter inventory benefit or optimization benefit that you are referring to earlier? That\u2019s the first question. The second question maybe for Lane. U.S. natural gas price look like it\u2019s going to be higher. So, if we look at your system, do you see a lot of opportunity of reducing your energy cost further or that you have already done so much is really difficult and will be too expensive if you\u2019re trying to have any meaningful reduction in the energy cost from the current level? Eric Fisher : Okay. So, I\u2019ll start on the margin indicator. We had the same discussion that our margin indicator still includes the $1 PTC in the calculation. One of the challenges in this PTC environment is because it\u2019s carbon intensity based, that will vary with our feedstock slate. And so, we haven\u2019t had enough run time or as you said, enough clarity to really know how this is all going to line out because we can think of scenarios where certain feedstocks get very cheap that might have a higher CI or we\u2019ll continue to see the incentive to run the lowest CI feedstocks and those obviously have higher benefits in the PTC. So, it\u2019s a little hard to nail down the, how we want to adjust the margin indicator. So our decision, we\u2019re going to keep it the same for now until we see a little more development on how we\u2019re going to be running in this new policy environment. Paul Cheng : Eric, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not asking about the margin indicator. I\u2019m asking that when you report the first quarter result in your result, should we just assume that you would take out the $1 per gallon for the PTC in your margin and not including any benefit from the PTC because that\u2019s not being finalized or that when you report the result in the first quarter, you actually will do some provisional estimate of what your DGD results should be under the PTC as you understand? Lane Riggs : Hey Paul, this is Lane. The way we do our financials is particularly on that side, it\u2019s really on the act. There won\u2019t be a provisional like, hey, we think the PTC benefit is going to ultimately be this, if it\u2019s not, we don\u2019t have clear policy in the first quarter, it will be whatever it is. Paul Cheng : Okay, so we will just pick out the PTC benefit but not including any estimate for the PTC for you guys? Lane Riggs : Correct. Paul Cheng : Okay. And how about in terms of Eric, can you share what is the inventory benefit in the fourth quarter? Eric Fisher : Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to give that level of detail out. But, it was just an end of year optimization that we did at both units in the fourth quarter. Paul Cheng : All right. So, how about, Lane, about the energy cost? Lane Riggs : I\u2019m going to at least initially push this over to Greg. So, go ahead Greg. Greg Bram : Hey, Paul. So, with low energy costs and a lot of that meaning low natural gas and low cost for power for our plants in North America. You don\u2019t see a lot of incentive to try to do a project to further reduce your energy consumption. There\u2019s just not a lot of opportunity there from a value standpoint. We do see opportunities in Pembroke. We\u2019ve done some things at the refinery there to improve energy efficiency because their costs are quite a bit higher. So, I would say in general that\u2019s unless you see a marked change in the cost of natural gas or power, it\u2019s going to be hard to justify some kind of an improvement project. Always trying to be as efficient as we can be in the base operation, so there\u2019s no change there, but, in terms of some kind of investment to make a step change, that\u2019s hard to do in the current environment. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Joe Laetsch of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Laetsch : Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I wanted to ask a couple on the quarter. From our standpoint, it looked like the Mid Con came in stronger on throughput and capture, while the West Coast was say remained a bit weaker, which I think was driven in part by maintenance. Could you just talk to any specific drivers during the quarter for the Mid Con and West Coast in particular from a capture and throughput standpoint? Greg Bram : Yes, Joe, this is Greg. So, West Coast is fairly simple and you hit on it. It was maintenance work primarily at Venetia that impacted not so much throughput there, but it impacted the amount of transportation fuel we could make and so that had an impact on the capture rate. In the Mid Con, throughput was higher. We actually saw pretty good incentive to continue to maximize throughput there, good demand for products. And so, we were able to push throughput a little bit higher than we had planned going into the quarter. And then on the capture side, one of the factors there, you saw crude market structure on WTI less backward than you saw in the prior quarter that had a benefit to capture rates in addition to some of the things I talked about earlier on butane blending. Joe Laetsch : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I wanted to shift gears and ask about the Ethanol segment. So, the indicator continues to grind to lower to start the year. Could you just talk to some of the puts and takes going on in the industry as well as your forward outlook? And then, also the potential for year round E15, which was included in the executive orders released last week? Thank you. Eric Fisher : Yes. The ethanol margin has been challenged with high inventories and high production rates. I\u2019ll say surprisingly high production rates that have been sustained really for the third quarter and fourth quarter and into the beginning of this year. We have seen some weather related impacts to production rates, but I think overall you\u2019re looking at high inventories and high production rates. And so, it\u2019s keeping ethanol margins currently, I would say, below mid-cycle. So, in terms of E15 there\u2019s always a lot of positive outlook for that. As you know we\u2019ve continued to see E15 approved by emergency order every 20 days. We don\u2019t see a lot of E15 movements. We don\u2019t see a lot of growth in that market. We do see Canada still talking about moving to E15 this year through their CFR program. I think there\u2019s a high likelihood you\u2019re more likely to see incremental E15 in Canada before appreciably in the U.S. But, I mean we\u2019ll see how this develops this year by policy. It\u2019s still a fairly significant logistics challenge to convert retail to E15. But, overall I mean it\u2019s still something that certainly the Ethanol and Ag industry sees as a positive development for ethanol outlook. Joe Laetsch : Great, thank you all. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Matthew Blair : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding the Canadian tariffs, you talked about some of the impacts on the crude side. How about the product side for Valero and especially in regards to your Quebec City plant? What kind of volumes does Quebec send to the New York Harbor? And, if there were tariffs imposed, do you think it\u2019d be pretty easy to ship those volumes to Latin America or Europe or would we expect to see lower operating rates at Quebec City? Thanks. Gary Simmons : Yes. This is Gary. For the most part our Quebec system is short gasoline. So we import gasoline. A lot of that tends to come from Pembroke. There are periods in the year where we\u2019re long diesel and typically that does go to New York Harbor. We could place those barrels anywhere in the world. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a throughput reduction as a result of tariffs. Matthew Blair : Sounds good. And then, you mentioned some of the potential impacts from the 45Z. One other impact is that RD from foreign UCO appears to no longer qualify for a credit. Is DGD a major importer of foreign UCO? And if so, how would you expect to replace those volumes? Eric Fisher : Yes, so you\u2019re correct foreign UCO no longer qualifies for domestic RD. Our foreign UCO is and has always been pointed at SAF going into Europe and the U.K. So, the PTC doesn\u2019t really change what we were going to do strategically with that feedstock. And so, that\u2019s our view as we\u2019ll continue to run that into the SAF into the Europe and U.K. markets. Matthew Blair : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Gabelman : Yes. Hey, morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask first on the CapEx budget. I believe you said $1.6 billion of sustaining CapEx, which is about $300 million above the five year average, it\u2019s the highest level since 2019. So, I\u2019m wondering if that is an indicator of above average turnaround activity in your system for 2025 and if not what\u2019s driving that higher sustaining spend? Lane Riggs : Hey Jason, this is Lane. So, we normally we sort of talk about our sustaining capital in terms of sort of average and so we average about or, we think about it being $1.5 billion that\u2019s inclusive of turnaround, inclusive of CapEx for ongoing sustaining operations. And so, if you sort of and catalyst, so when you think in your mind well if it\u2019s lumpy, if it gets lumpy on the higher side or the lower side, the only thing it can be is additional turnaround work. Jason Gabelman : Okay. Thanks. And, my follow-up is just, sorry I\u2019m going to ask another one on the Canadian tariffs. Valero, I believe, has a lot of its refineries within foreign trade zones and those foreign trade zones typically aren\u2019t subject to tariffs. So, given that 1Q, just clarify that most of your U.S. Gulf Coast system is in foreign trade zones and because of that, do you think you would be able to, if the tariffs are implemented in a very direct way, you\u2019d be able to sidestep those tariffs? And also, do you get any benefit now from operating in those foreign trade zones? Thanks. Richard Walsh : Yes. This is Rich Walsh. I would just say that you can\u2019t tell anything until you see what the program comes out with, right? So, it just depends on how this is all structured. So, we also bring in a lot and export a lot. And so, that\u2019s really what the foreign trade zone helps with. And so, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s really trying to avoid domestic tariffs in any way along those lines. So, until you see what they\u2019re proposing and how it\u2019s structured, you really can\u2019t tell whether there\u2019s going to be benefit or not. Lane Riggs : But, we do have foreign trade zones. Richard Walsh : Yes, yes, we have foreign trade zones. Jason Gabelman : Got it. Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Bhullar for closing comments. Homer Bhullar : Thank you, Donna. Appreciate everyone joining us today. Obviously, feel free to contact the IR team if you have any additional questions. Have a great day, everyone. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s event.
